ec's talks with political parties

the decision to rename the villages of the seven birshreshthas of the liberation war of 1971 and three martyrs of the 1952 language movement after their names is indeed a highly commendable one. we are also happy to learn that the government has further decided to establish a library and a memorial museum in each of the villages through the local district councils. this is almost akin to paying off a debt that has been long due. surely this laudable step will help keep the memory of their heroic deeds ever fresh in the minds of the present and future generations.

iran, the region and the united states
the regional security landscape and tehran's security outlook has dramatically changed since 11 september 2001. in 2000, at the beginning of this decade, iran had two sworn enemies on either flank -- the taliban regime in afghanistan in the east and saddam hussein in iraq on the west. after the terrorist attacks on the usa on 9/11, the dynamics started evolving first in afghanistan and then later in iraq. soon after the attacks on new york and washington came the american-led international coalition invasion in afghanistan that overthrew the talibans. then, less than two years later came the toppling of saddam hussein's regime.
let's have our indigenous version of pluralism
acivilised society is now 'architectured' upon market economy and democracy, human right based liberal ideology, enlightened civil society and free press, pluralism being the pivotal force to all. pluralism is a pervasive and comprehensive concept of recognising, interacting and stabilising with diverse opinions and dogmas. it entails that every thing has got its inherent phenotypes of meaning, understanding and implication. open market economy principally rests on pluralism, the grand total of price mechanism and rationality of customers and producers. it holds that a market has pluralistic customers and suppliers, and the price and production of any goods depends on its demand and supply. the core driving force of the open economy is the multifarious competition among the consumers and producers for the price and value. view the page sports

let their voice be heard
the structural factors which perpetuate poverty in bangladesh include little access of the poor to economic and political resources. poverty, as a multi-dimensional deprivation is the inability of people to meet economic, social and other standards of well-being. the multiple causes of poverty are either internal or structural or induced (man-induced and/or policy-induced) and certainly linked to low income, lack of education and poor health. but, there is a growing emphasis on considering poverty as a direct result of inadequate policies and ill-designed development programmes, such as those preventing sustainable access to social services or productive assets (e.g. land and financial resources) and thus hampering economic empowerment.

kali o kolom january 2008
this latest issue of kali o kolom contains articles on three foreign authors: simone de beauvoir, gabriel garcia marquez (aged 90) and his novella written after a silence of ten years (its english translation has been released as memories of my melancholy whores ), and normal mailer, the american novelist who died recently. while the one on de beauvoir is replete with commonplaces, anything on marquez is always eminently readable, and the one here is no exception. the piece on mailer, though informative and informal, yet fails to discuss mailer's 1968 armies of the night, which won him both the pulitzer and the national book award and boosted the genre of creative nonfiction to new heights--though part of the problem is, as the writer correctly points out, the unavailibility of books in dhaka . there are two graceful and affectionate in-memoriums: one of proshanto kumar pal (the biographer of rabindranath who completed 10 volumes of his rabijiboni and yet left his task unfinished, a commentary perhaps on the amount of toil necessary to completely view the poet's life and work), and sanjeev chowdhury, bangladeshi writer, editor and musician. among the essays there is an account of some fascinating research being conducted about women writers of pre-modern east bengal by writer shaheen akhtar, two volumes of which has been published (and which also has been favourably reviewed in this particular issue of kali o kolom ). there is also the usual complement of art/artist and book reviews, poems and short stories--among the latter nasima anis's daat (teeth) and ashutosh debnath's ghashforing (grasshopper) make for enjoyable reading. there is an usual piece on tokyo's car shows (motorgaari'r kabya) by manjurul haque, demonstrating both a writing style and choice of theme not usually encountered in bangla. as usual, all pieces and articles are accompanied by the drawings and sketches of some of the best artists of the country, which by themselves make for a separate category of aesthetic experience.

territorial questions between eritrea and yemen
it is rare that an international tribunal awards total victory to one party in a maritime boundary dispute. this appears to be almost inevitably so even in situations where strict application of legal principles to the geography of the situation would seem to require that result. two maritime boundary arbitrations- the 1999 eritrea v yemen and qatar v bahrain case under the 1982 law of the sea convention (unclos) merit discussion. the international law of maritime delimitation has been the subject of considerable examination during the past half century. the history of the development of the law through the cases, starting from the 1969 north sea continental shelf cases, has been well documented and it would be better to focus on both the maritime boundary cases decided under the unclos. first of all, we would like to discuss the eritrea and yemen case, which was the delimitation of a single maritime boundary.

the continuing saga of the mau mau revolt
immanuel wallerstein, in the process of discussing accelerating decolonisation of much of africa since the end of world war ii, talks about the intent of white settlers in colonial kenya and southern rhodesia: that whatever the devolution of powers by constitutional means, power should go to them as a group rather than to the black majority. “indeed to ensure that this was so,” he explains in a 1972 article, “white settlers sought to achieve federations of the strong settler territory with its immediate neighbors, among other reasons lest power be turned over to black africans in the neighbors and thus affect by example the settler territories. in east africa the federation was to bring together settler-dominated kenya with uganda and tanganyika.” however, the federation idea faltered in east africa because of spirited resistance in uganda and the outbreak of mau mau insurrection in kenya in 1952. now a new book, rethinking the mau mau in colonial kenya, takes another look at the mau mau revolt, where the author aims to explore two broad theses: that colonial power and resistance to it are intertwined with each other, and that, as a fallout from such entanglement, both are transformed in various ways.
spirituality that determined history's course
in this very lucid narrative, karen armstrong, by now an accomplished writer on comparative religion with such works as a history of god, islam: a short history, the bible, and important biographies of muhammad and buddha behind her, explains how and why people of varied environment and cultures took to developing the fundamental spirituality that shapes the world even today. they did it without even knowing each other, their actions were based on very different realities, but there is a surprising coherence in the core message they left for us. armstrong writes in a chronological story-telling fashion how people from different regions went about developing the core spirituality defining the axial age. in the very first chapter (the axial peoples: 1600 to 900 bc), she tells the story of the journey of aryans from the south russian steppes into northern india, how the terrain and the social realities gave rise to the vedic sages' spirituality which would ultimately lead to the later very mature upanishadic spirituality.

the artist, in his black and white moments
guru is a publication celebrating a good number of outstanding images of sm sultan (1923-1994), a legendary artist of bangladesh. the photos have been snapped by nasir ali mamun, who spent ten years in pursuit of this loner artist and recorded his sufferings, struggle and ecstasy. for me personally, photography is pleasing not only as a matter of aesthetics but for the technical aspects of it as well: the lens choice, focus, shutter and aperture selection, film rewind, et cetera. he is very sensitive about the connection between subjects and techniques. mamun's themes are renowned creative figures and personalities of the world and his camera has captured many outstanding moments in the lives of rare personalities.
