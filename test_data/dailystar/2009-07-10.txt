our captain
what have sachin tendulkar, bryan lara and other veteran cricketers done for their nation? the answer to this question from the cricket lovers will undoubtedly be that they have done a lot. but when the same question is put to the cricketers themselves they usually try to avert the answer and say they have done nothing yet or little and are trying to do better. the same answer will perhaps come from the successful people in other fields also. interestingly, in the case of our national cricket team captain ashraful, without even facing the above question, he answered it quite arrogantly that he had done a lot for the country and wanted to do more. astonishing! how could a cricketer like him make such an impertinent remark?
black vs. white money
accumulation of black money is the result of corruption, evasion of taxes and sometime crime. for a capitalist economy this is inevitable. the british empire flourished with the assets plundered from its colonies. so is the case of other colonial powers. the largest economy of the world, the us economy, was founded by slave labourers illegally brought from africa. later, the economy flourished on mafia money lavishly invested in real estate, films and banking sectors. now all these economies are white.
business corruption
according to the world economic forum global competitiveness report 2008-2009, the major constraint on foreign companies operating in bangladesh is corruption, followed by inefficient government bureaucracy, policy instability, inadequate infrastructure and inadequate access to financing. corruption is present in most interactions with public authorities. according to the world bank & ifc enterprise surveys 2007, 85% of the companies surveyed expect to pay unofficial payments to 'get things done', while 55% identify corruption as a major constraint for doing business. small and medium sized companies suffer most from corruption, as they devote proportionately more resources and time than larger companies to paying bribes and dealing with regulations. when bribes are measured as a share of costs by company size, the level of unofficial payments by the smallest companies (below 50 employees) is nearly five times the level paid by large companies (with over 159 employees). private sector corruption is also widespread. while laws on disclosure of assets and conflict of interest exist, they are rarely enforced. significant parts of the state budget (including state owned companies) remain outside legislative control. former government employees or politically active persons often lead trade and business associations. according to the transparency international bangladesh household survey 2005, the private sector is highly corrupt in the country. while private public sector corruption is illegal, business-to-business corruption is not. audits cannot always be trusted, as auditors rarely conform to international standards and are known to produce reports according to the wishes of the client.
gene mechanics
it is a brief response to further comments received by me on gene mechanics. one of the purposes of writing, at this point in time, articles on genes was to trigger internal human motivation at local, global and other levels for intensification of exploration in sub-atomic areas of genes (used in an equivalent sense) - yet to come into existence though, because, for example, genes make up 2% of your dna, the remaining 98% has no known function.

moral imperative
this refers to mr. md. anwarul kabir's article on morality published in your daily on 22nd june. indeed, at this point of time religion has lost its strength to instil morality in human psyche. however, the reason behind this failure as mr. kabir has argued in the article, "this failure of religion can be explained in line with freud's conscious and sub-conscious states of mind. although the majority of muslims consciously try to be religious, their sub-conscious mind contradicts it. the vehicle for religious belief is the fear of the day of judgment. ironically, this fear is not effective in the sub-conscious of the modern people. the precondition of religion is the surrender to religious scriptures. but the logic oriented sub-conscious mind is reluctant to accept anything blindly. so, at present, though people consciously engage themselves in religious rituals, religion fails to reach its prime objective". i am not fully convinced.

parking on streets
first of all, i would like to congratulate you for your report "parking on streets....." (july 01, 2009). the dcc has assigned a firm to collect tolls from parked vehicles on the streets. now my question would be why would the dcc allow parking on streets for monetary benefit whereas such parking on streets should be totally banned so that the terrible traffic congestion in the city may be eased. i am a resident of gulshan-2, dhaka. in the last few months i have noticed the dcc has put up signboards on the main gulshan avenue that parking is not allowed on the main avenue and that parking should be made in assigned places of the dcc where you have to pay toll. i have since noticed that parking on the main gulshan avenue goes on unabated.
wedding lights
recently, after the implementation of the energy saving policy by our government, part of one of the streets of dhanmondi where i live was entirely lit up by wedding decoration lights for two whole days. well, as long as they paid for consuming so much electricity others are probably not supposed to be bothered about it. however, a marching wedding band beating drums and playing trumpets throughout the day and in the middle of the night in a residential area did raise some eyebrows.
cyber crime
people of our country are envisioning 'digital bangladesh' whereas some crimes are being traced in the digital world. one such crime is cyber crime. it is actually a criminal activity done by users through the internet. these crimes committed through the internet are of several types. these include copyright infringement, software piracy, password cracking or cheating by others' id, cyber pornography, e-mail threats, hacking others' websites and so on. sometimes people superimpose the images of others through the internet and create great problems. hackers continue hacking of important websites across the globe as well as plunder the secrecy of others. for example, the recent hacking of rab's (rapid action battalion) website degraded the image of bangladeshi defence.
afghan scene
it is historically proved that afghanistan is a grave for any illegal occupant. that again has been reflected in the reality from where the usa cannot extricate itself. now the usa has to expend 22,000$ per minute in war during the critical global recession and the cost is a big burden on obama's administration.
