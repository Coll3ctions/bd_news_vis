mourning edward kennedy
the death of edward kennedy of brain cancer at the age of seventy-seven is particular cause for sorrow on the part of the people of bangladesh. the reason why such should be our feeling is not difficult to fathom. back in the tortuous days of our struggle for liberation from pakistan in 1971, when bengalis were marked out for genocide and when as many as ten million of them fled to safety in neighbouring india, senator kennedy took up our cause in his country and in the international arena. his support gave that certain boost to our struggle that was so necessary for us at the time. the nixon administration, in its misplaced obsession with opening a road to ties with china through making use of pakistan, conveniently looked the other way as the then pakistan establishment went on eliminating bengalis. mr. kennedy chose to uphold reality as it then was.

traffic problem in dhaka
dhaka, the capital of the country and one of the most densely populated mega-cities in the world, has been lacking in proper infrastructure, considering mobility, pollution etc. it is a matter of utter dismay that dhaka is still deprived of an effective mass transit system even though the population is over 13 million with a fair possibility that it will be doubled by 2015-2016.
shahrukh khan
it is indeed shocking to know that bollywood superstar shahrukh khan was detained for about two hours early at new york airport in the us because his surname featured on the most common list. the actor, who is visiting the us to attend a south asian event where he was the guest of honour was released after congress mp rajiv shukla spoke to the authorities in the us and the indian consulate. the actor was detained after his name flashed on the computer. he was asked several questions about the purpose of his visit. his hand baggage was checked. he was not allowed to even make a phone call for nearly an hour. the actor tried his best but he could not convince the immigration officers. this was not the first incident of a muslim being harassed by the us immigration officers. previously former president of india apj abdul kalam was also harassed in the same fashion. it is really unfair to judge muslims in this way. just because he has a common surname does not mean that every muslim can be taken as a suspect or considered to be a terrorist.
rickshaw issue
after a long interval, my old friend mr rahat of malibagh has resurrected himself again (“let's not be biased”, ds 17/08/09) on the subject of the total banning of rickshaws from dhaka's streets. once again as in the past, his letter is a kitchurie of pious platitudes, dreams, innuendos and hope, without any pragmatic suggestion to solve the perennial traffic headache. his letter takes me to task for advocating the continued existence of rickshaws. i am proud to do so. i too would like to see the end of the rickshaw within my lifetime, but only if there is a viable alternative. the letter “minister's position” right next to his letter would perhaps help to educate him, as many of the answers are staring him in the face, but i doubt it.
systems loss
as part of the government's measure to implement cht peace accord, one brigade of the army comprising 35 army camps and 3 infantry battalions shall be withdrawn from chittagong hill tracts by sept'09. the process has already been started with the withdrawal of some army camps. it is alright if the service of the army is not required there and in that case their continual stay is nothing but mere wastage of govt. money. it is learnt from the newspapers that one brigade comprises not less than 3,000 persons. there is no other alternative but to maintain these personnel keeping them idle without any job. again this is wastage of govt. money. so this loss being incurred is due to government's action. this is govt. systems loss like the systems loss in the power sector. the govt. systems loss is a very common phenomenon in all government agencies, small or big but this is not being taken into account seriously.

clinton foundation
when president bill clinton was in the white house office, he had to get all his plans and programmes with whatever noble intentions passed by the congress. he had also to face the critics and the press to justify his intentions. but after successful completion of his tenure in the office of the president, clinton has now freely devoted himself to the activities of his foundation, that is, “the clinton foundation” which seeks to address some of the world's more pressing challenges, such as, hiv/aids, global climate change, and extreme poverty - through collaborative and systematic efforts. by this time, the clinton foundation has achieved remarkable success in controlling hiv/aids, adverse effects of greenhouse gases, eradicating poverty and promoting healthy education environments. in a recent letter received by this writer from the former us president bill clinton who is also the president of the clinton foundation, clinton wrote:
history speaks
this month of august speaks many thing about the powerful nations. although now the usa calls itself the most civilized nation but this month august reflects many things. in this month in 1945, the us air force dropped atom bombs on nagasaki and hiroshima killing millions of innocent people. these shows how deadly americans can be to gain victory or success.
separate water supply line
prime minister sheikh hasina, according to a front-page report of your daily of 19 august 2009, issued instructions to wasa to install separate supply lines to distribute pure drinking water to dhaka city dwellers. the reasons mentioned in the news item are to stop wastage and resolve the existing problems. the instructions were passed on to a delegation of bangabanbdhu prakaushali parishad and institution of engineers bangladesh, while they made a courtesy call with the pm. the installation of the total water line of the city is really a gigantic task and it involves huge money and time. moreover, when the installation work will start, digging hazards will surely cause immense sufferings to the city dwellers. the existing position of digging the city roads by different agencies is intolerable to the city dwellers. the standard of drinking water in dhaka city at the moment is not that low excepting sporadic complaints from some quarters. acute public sufferings of the city dwellers at the moment are not due to drinking water, though a lot of things remain to be done in this regard. water logging from short lived rain, mal-coordination among different agencies, leaving the dug roads un-repaired for long, frequent load shedding, among others are the major problems faced the city dwellers.
