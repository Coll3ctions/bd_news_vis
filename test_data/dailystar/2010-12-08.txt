bangladeshi ship in pirate hands
the seizure of a bangladeshi vessel, mv jahan moni, by somali pirates on sunday on the arabian sea once again brings to light a problem which has increasingly been upsetting sensibilities everywhere. the state of lawlessness which somalia has been going through, particularly in the absence of a credible government, has spawned all this piracy which is today a menace before every nation engaged in shipping. in the past, these pirates have seized not only ships and their crew but have also abducted individuals who were simply on excursions on small vessels. it can be easily surmised as to what torment hostages go through at the hands of the somali pirates, who hardly have any inclination, other than demanding ransom, towards demonstrating decent and civilized behaviour. view the page sports

charter for change!
on 12th december 2008, awami league leaders declared election manifesto and electoral pledges by announcing charter for change. on the following day i.e. 13th december 2008, all the newspapers carried out special news features about al's declaration of new vision and mission. it is hoped that the honourable editor and readers of the daily star can recollect it. we, the general people, were very optimistic about the future golden days to come. we thought that the evil things of the past would disappear and new era in our life would come if al was voted to power. there would be no lie, no conspiracy, no false statement, no hypocrisy, no vandalism, no session jam in the educational institutions, no extortion by the political leaders and activists and so on. we were dreaming that the prices of all essential commodities would be within the reach of common people. in brief, the past with bad things would be replaced with many good things for us.
small flyovers
the construction work of the much talked about and controversial jatrabari flyover has started. how many people and motor vehicles would use the giant flyover from one end to another and help lessen and solve the traffic jam in dhaka city? the flyover would not be able to help the people of the important, busy and crowded areas. the huge waste of time in dhaka roads is due to frequent halt of motor vehicles at innumerable road crossings, road squares, road turning points, road intersections and traffic signals of important and busy roads. construction of a giant flyover will not reduce the traffic jams in dhaka. we can neither reduce the growing population of dhaka nor do away with its increasing number of vehicles. further we cannot ban holding of meetings, rallies and processions; and hawkers and vendors will stay on the streets.
international year of chemistry
the year 2011 has been recognised by the unesco as the international year of chemistry (iyc 2011) in an attempt to increase the general interest in this field of science. this year of chemistry will commemorate the achievements of chemistry and its glorious contributions to science and mankind. the resolution of iyc was put forward by ethiopia, co-sponsored by 23 nations, and the declaration from un came in 2008. to make the year a success, different national organisations such as royal society of chemistry, american chemical society, brazilian chemical society, and regional federations like european association for chemistry and molecular sciences have taken many programmes. the events arranged will surely try to involve the public and the young generation for making them aware of the significance of chemistry in our everyday life.
early education
nowadays, we see that many parents get their kids admitted into schools as soon as s/he turns three. at an early age, it is natural for the kids to play and learn the ways of life from their parents and the surrounding environment. but the kids are compelled to take the load of studies in these days. this is harmful for their mental health. so, i request all parents not to admit their kids into schools until they reach the age of six.
punish the harassers
incidents of harassment are taking place one after another. the usual way of handling the cases by the law enforcing authorities is not enough any more. in the usual way, after the first few days of hue and cry the matter subsides.
smearing prof. yunus' integrity
the recent news in media on misuse of norwegian aid by prof yunus drew my attention. this is simply vilification of a man whom they honoured with a nobel prize very recently. i am not a supporter of microcredit or any ngo activity. microcredit helps, in certain cases, some people and some time, but not a poor society at large and never. but prof. yunus firmly believes that microcredit can be a good way for poverty alleviation in poor countries. i do not doubt his sincerity. i strongly believe that prof. yunus is an honest man and trying to do something for poverty alleviation. i disagree with him on the benefit of microcredit and i don't believe that microcredit can make any society well off and poverty free. only a good government and massive investment aiming poverty alleviation can help a country to uplift from the curse of poverty. don't the norwegian and western world know it? why this hue and cry now?
go tigers!
quite frankly, the performance of the bangladesh cricket team against new zealand took us all by surprise. except for a few instances, they were quite professional in playing the game. there was a marked difference in their body language, especially in the fielding department; earlier we've seen countless times the good work of the bowlers being spoiled by shoddy fielding. and it should be mentioned how shakib al hasan has grown over the years and led the team from the front. we've seen him providing crucial breakthroughs, steering the team out of danger when wickets fall consistently at the other end, and of course, winning games for bangladesh almost single-handedly. bangladesh team is performing brilliantly in the five-match micromax odi series against zimbabwe.
encourage musa ibrahim
musa ibrahim, the first ever bangladeshi to conquer the mount everest, did not get the honour, recognition, any grant or even an award from either the government or any private organisation for his outstanding achievement. the government is still a silent spectator. why the government or any private organisation is not coming forward to encourage him is still a mystery to me. i have come to know that he is undertaking more challenging missions in future. he should be supported by the govt. and other agencies as well.
containing population problem
bangladesh has a population of over 160 million. the area of bangladesh is too small for this vast population. as a result, we are facing many problems. the government should launch awareness raising programmes along with other measures to contain this problem which is the root cause of all other problems. the authorities should implement the plans of the government. people should be made aware of the gravity of the problem so that they will consider taking two children only. proper education is the key to succeed in reducing the birth rate. campaigns would be very effective in the villages and urban slums. the country will not develop in any sector unless population problem is contained.
why hartal?
bangladesh is a country with a lot of possibilities. but we cannot utilise these because of our leading political parties' bad practices. political environment was never in a stable position in our country. one statistics shows that bangladesh has suffered about three years of hartal in thirty-nine years.
a proposal to ease traffic jam
we are living in a city where there seems to be more vehicles than people. apart from the private cars, which are fairly in good condition; taxi cabs, cng auto-rickshaws, public buses (except for the brtc buses) are in a dilapidated condition. these public transports, as i might put in my own words, 'have died a natural death many years ago.' but they are still plying the roads of dhaka. i wonder why the government is not taking any steps to get these 'dead vehicles' off the road. may be the authorities concerned to check the fitness of these 'dead vehicles' are offered a good amount of bribe to keep their eyes closed. it seems like brta's motto is - “see no fitness, and a pocket full of richness!”
we are very upset
the government has completed its mission, eviction of khaleda zia, not caring about people's views, feelings, and likes or dislikes. the manner in which it was settled is very disquieting. it seems that the government does not care about the people.
chariots of fire
readers may well be familiar with the term "chariots of fire" fondly used by the famous french writer dominique lapierre in his novel "city of joy." dominique lapierre used this term to describe the rickshaws of kolkata.
death of freedom fighters
dewan farid gazi, mir shawkat ali, and lutful hai died one after another recently. we are greatly shocked at these deaths in such a short time. it is said that the only permanent thing in this universe is 'change'. death is one kind of change. every death makes a vacuum. all the citizens of this independent country mourned the deaths of these freedom fighters. i express my condolence to the bereaved family members.
police box on footpath!
people of khilkhet area were shocked when they saw a real estate company named "home stone limited" occupied the maximum portion of a footpath near the local police station and the foot overbridge. a police box was also built by occupying the footpath. this time, the footpath grabbers used the name of the police. hundreds of students, office goers and local people of nikunja-1 and nikunja-2 are suffering every day. it will definitely tarnish the image of the whole police department.
