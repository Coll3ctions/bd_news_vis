eviction of illegal structures
this is to thank the hc bench for its order to evict the illegal shanties and other establishments from cox's bazar sea beach and also the authorities concerned for leading the drive in this regard. true, it is a good news for the whole country that the world's longest sea beach and one of the most popular resorts has finally been freed from the clutches of the unscrupulous land-grabbers, especially on the eve of an international event, i.e. world cup cricket 2011, when greater number of visitors are expected to throng this idyllic beach. but it has always been seen that during most of such drives against illegal structures, some structures are spared because of the occupants' political identity.

towards an indo-pak nuclear lexicon

the fatwa scourge
this is a tragedy that the whole nation should mourn and protest. the national conscience was savagely traumatised. hena akhter is a victim of the gender discrimination that prevails in our country. it is an indictment of the poverty that the underprivileged of our country suffer, and the injustice and bigotry that hold them in thralldom.
heeding the message
it is very unfortunate that although we achieved our independence through an armed struggle and the supreme sacrifice of three million of our heroic souls, one of our political streams is termed "pro-independence" while the other is termed the opposite. any devotion to those infallible values is characterised as pro-al, as was done by the leader of the opposition when she called a popular bengali daily a pro-government one, although it is probably the strongest critic of government wrongdoings. view the page startech
