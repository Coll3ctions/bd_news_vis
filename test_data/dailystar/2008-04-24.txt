these frequent power failures
a government committee has decided that as many as 15,000 bulbs and airconditioners will be withdrawn from the secretariat as an austerity measure. the decision was obviously made in light of the on-going crisis in the power sector. the move will be appreciated by everyone concerned about the waste of public resources, especially at the level of the government. the question that we must now deal with, though, is why these bulbs and airconditioners were there in the first place, particularly after a decision in may last year to have them removed. the stark truth, as we understand, is that these extra facilities were indeed withdrawn but were later surreptitiously re-installed. it is sheer wastage of taxpayers' money. now, if the move to put a stop to such wastage is truly implemented, the country will surely stand to benefit to a significant extent.
