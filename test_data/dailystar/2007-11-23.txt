food security
nearly ten lakh tonnes of aman crop loss may have been caused by the cyclone. annual food deficit has been estimated at 15-30 lakh tonnes in the recent years. aman shortfall being too large to be met even by a bumper boro harvest, most calculations put the overall deficit of foodgrains in the region of 40-50 lakh tonnes for the current fiscal year. both public and private sector will have to go on massive import of foodgrains at high costs these are selling in the international market. alongside, food grants should be welcomed. we can't scrounge too much from the internal source because these will push the prices up.

religion-based politics and all that
in recent times bangladesh polity has been experiencing quite heated discussions on demands for banning religion-based politics. there is a clamour for authoritative denial of recognition to political activities of the so-called religious parties. in specific terms, the election commission has been requested not to register parties that are accused of using, and perhaps misusing, religion for attaining political goals.
international reserves and the government
the level of international reserves of the country has attained the highest level ever, reaching $5.2 billion by the end of august. many regard it as a good omen for the economy, but others are more circumspect. a well-known business leader asked me why the government was unnecessarily building up such large international reserves; should it not instead use part of the reserves to assist industries that were smarting under the forces of global competition and multifarious domestic constraints! view the page sports

recurrent disasters
it was indeed appalling to go through the piece "dublarchar only talks of death, devastation" published in the daily star on 19 november. we, being unaffected, merely imagined the havoc wreaked by sidr. i perused the above-mentioned write-up to discover very soon that my imagination was simply outclassed by the real horrors that fell on the hapless people of the coastal region.
election 2008
we understand that the popularity of a politician is the parameter of his or her success. have we ever thought that “ unpopularity” can also be a big success in the political game play? this is what we are watching when measuring the success of a decision maker on all major national issues confronting the caretaker government. we hope things will change and the chief adviser would kindly create a focal point in his office to inform the people about national issues like election including reform measures. the expectations of the ctg and the bottom line concerning the political reform agenda should be made very clear.
war of liberation
i was rather sick during the last week when a hue and cry was raised by certain groups of people. i want to believe that people laid down their lives for bangladesh, and not for petty self-interest as claimed by some people. i want to believe the pakistanis oppressed us for a long time and mukti juddho was the volcanic eruption that started much earlier.
a new idea
during the last 30 years about 50 of my relatives came to the usa. some of these relatives passed comments that sparked an idea that has captured my mind and my heart, an idea i would like to share with you. i would like to get your support to turn the idea into a pilot project that could eventually help all the people in bangladesh.
poor traffic management
i think everybody will appreciate with me that after the present caretaker government took charge, every sector of our country has changed, except our traffic signal system. recently, i moved from j.u. to asad gate. for this reason i have to move on that road regularly.
mobile operators
a big part of our country has been ruined by the storm sidr. when all the news channels and daily newspapers were flooded with storm forecast and safety instructions, i received an sms from my mobile operator to call certain number to get an update of india-pakistan cricket match. why not an sms about the storm forecast?! that cell operator claims to have the largest coverage nationwide. couldn't they send some forecast about the upcoming storm through sms?
du language institute
in this modern age of information technology, english language skills work as a factor for development. without knowing english it is impossible to succeed in life. but there is no scope of learning english language effectively in our current syllabus of bengali medium. students are trying to improve their english language skills in different ways. in this respect, the modern language institute of dhaka university is playing a vital role. at present, junior certificate, senior certificate, short diploma courses (1 year duration) are going on at this institute. but except the short course, all the other courses are only for the students of dhaka university. this type of conservative system in an institute of du is really unfortunate. it may be mentioned that no admission test is required to get admitted in these courses, rather only a placement test for grading the students is taken. if needed competitive admission test may be taken for outside students to get admitted in these programmes. it may be mentioned that students of du also take help from different private coaching centres for preparing themselves to take participate in different english language testing systems like -ielts, toefl, gmat, gre, sat etc, though they have the opportunity to be skilled in english language at their modern language institute. so, this type of conservative approach has no practical value. besides the course fee for a 50-hour short course for a du student is tk 1000-1200. on the other hand, for outsiders the fee is tk 5,200. while the above mentioned private coaching takes tk 3,000-3,500 for such a course. this is really funny.
another world war?
due to their vanity, jealousy and anger, lack of wisdom, sincerity and statesmanship, adolph hitler of germany, henri petain of france, winston churchill of uk, joseph stalin of ussr, benito mussolini of italy, franklin roosevelt followed by harry truman of the usa and tojo hikeda of japan went berserk and their armed forces killed millions of people.
poor postal service
the postal service of our country is unsatisfactory. go to any post office and you will observe the following:
teachers
with my long teaching experience of nearly 40 years, i want to say that the students' lack of discipline at schools, colleges and universities reveals the truth of teachers' involvement in politics. since the youth force of our country played a vital role in the war of liberation in 1971, their correct evaluation has not been made as yet. lack of correct approach to students' problems and solutions thereof resulted in their being misled. proper counseling and analysis could have changed the situation for the better.
upcoming 28th bcs
in a report published in ds last september the reporter identified many things regarding the upcoming 28th bcs exams. i'd like to extend my heartiest greetings to the reporter for taking this sort of an initiative. no advertisement has been issued since 2005. already a good number of students have crossed the age limit. in this regard the public service commission (psc) can play a vital role by fixing the age limit as of november 2006, which was done during the 24th bcs, as the then bnp-led coalition government imposed an embargo after assuming office in 2001. then the same government considered the age limit for the 24th bcs exams. now the onus is on the honourable chairman of the psc. view the page international

lessons from cyclone sidr
not since the last 37 years has bangladesh suffered a natural disaster like the cyclone sidr of november 15, an unusually powerful storm that triggered giant waves up to 30ft (7m) high and killed more than 10,000 people in the south western coastal belt of bangladesh covering the districts of bagerhat, barisal, patuakhali, pirozepur, khulna and satkhira. even five days after the calamity, in village after village along the battered roads of the coastal districts, the survivors of the storm, their cheeks hollow and eyes sunken from hunger wait in vain for relief to come.
