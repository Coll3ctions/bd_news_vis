rising prices, vulnerable savings
these are crunch times for people in the middle and lower income groups. with their fixed incomes unable to cope with ever rising prices of essential food items, it is now their bare savings which are under threat. as a report in this newspaper makes it obvious, that dark moment when people must cough up their limited, even paltry savings in order to meet daily family expenses is finally here. with inflation going up to 8.80 per cent in the last fiscal year from 7.31 per cent in the one preceding it, one does not require much wisdom to grasp the nature of the predicament fixed income groups are caught in.

adulteration in food during ramadan!
news entitled “special drives in ramadan against food adulteration” in the daily star of 1st august drew my attention. this drive will continue during the whole month of ramadan. that news indicates that our unethical and corrupt activities increase more during the holy month of ramadan than the rest of the months of the year. in our country it is difficult to find out any food item or fruit which is free from chemical or other harmful elements. but as a muslim nation such attitude is disgraceful for us. islam teaches us to live in an honest way. in my opinion, social awareness is very urgent for peaceful living. no drive will eliminate adulteration in food and corruption in the society until and unless we follow the teachings of islam and change our corrupt mindset. how many places will the law enforcing agencies or bsti go to find out the dishonest businessmen? only moral lesson can change our corrupt mindset.
mannan bhuiyan's death anniversary
poor media coverage on abdul mannan bhuiyan's 1st death anniversary surprised us. only a few words from dr. akbar ali khan's speech, given in the memorial meeting held in jatiya press club on 30th july 2011, were published in some dailies. but mannan bhuiyan was a veteran politician of this country who served as secretary general of bnp for 11 years. we know that bnp expelled him in september 2007, and is this the reason why our media did not cover this news?
what our police should do
crime is increasing in bangladesh day by day, particularly in the capital. in dhaka the most common types of crimes are hijacking and robbery. in the daily newspapers, every day we get several news of hijacking in the capital. it is very common news that the muggers snatch away money after stabbing the victim.
stop beating about the bush
i laugh at the food and disaster management minister's suggestion that the election commission should impose more restrictions on spending money by union council polls candidates on electioneering to curb misappropriation of money because it shrewdly bypasses their offenders. it is like admonishing the guardian for his son's offense. actually what we have to do is to plug the loopholes of law and stem the corruption so that bad people cannot misappropriate government money. this year government gave two lac taka to our college but to draw that money we had to bribe the upazila officials and fight the student cadres at the college. so please do not beat about the bush, keep your golden children at bay and remove corruption from government offices which is one of the promises you made in the election manifesto. if that can be done, it will do wonder.
price hike
at present the main problem of bangladesh is obviously price hike. it is increasing day by day. as a result, middle class and lower class people are suffering most. during this holy ramadan some greedy and selfish businessmen are increasing the price of the necessary commodities. i would like to draw the kind attention of the authorities for taking effective measures to control price hike so that general people can buy necessary commodities at a bearable rate.
we cannot trust strangers anymore
in the past, life was not burdened with so many problems. people used to go out, travel from one place to another in a care-free manner, feeling safe and secure. during journeys they used to make new friends, exchanged addresses and shared food and drinks. nowadays we have to be always on guard, unable to trust unknown people because so many untoward incidents are happening. we have to warn our children to remain distanced from strangers and after the incident at amin bazar, we have to tell them not to go in groups anywhere. in former days, many school children, even some in class vi or vii used to go to school riding bicycles but now it is unthinkable because miscreants will hijack the cycle, killing or seriously injuring the child. the condition of our society is deteriorating fast. if nothing is done to improve it, the outcome will be disastrous.
illegal police boxes
thank you daily star for publishing a courageous and timely report, on illegal police boxes erected around the corners of our city, which bears the names of some business houses of the country, made to serve their business publicity in disguise (ds: 1.8.11). we, the city dwellers, are used to see that the traffic police even use the umbrellas with the names of some known infamous business houses, realtors or even manpower export agencies which bestow them some sort of legality or reliability.
the new international airport
the government has decided, finally, to build a new international airport and the prime minister has directed the authorities concerned to report about the prospective sites to her within a week (ds: 2.8.11). it appears from the report that sirajdikhan is about 18 km. away from the zero point while other places are very far except arial beel, where the government failed to convince people earlier and the pm personally negated to build the dream airport there in the end. considering the physical location and proximity with the capital city, cost, time for commuting, passengers' convenience including the vvips (local and international) etc., we think the proposed new international airport should be established at sirajdikhan. we would like to request the pm not to be happy with the sycophancy of some timeservers; rather she should be meticulous and take the public with her before investing thousands of crores of taka of our poor people.
indo-american relationship
what i perceived having seen the current trends and development in the international political arena, there is no absolute code for relationship between nations and there is no postulate for keeping diplomatic communication. it's good, if it is really meant for greater good, international peace and security if the united states wishes to come closer to india and strengthen indo-american relationship. unfortunately pakistan which was very closer to us's heart lost its position and became an alien to its best friend, america!
kitchen markets -the source of all eid happiness!
i love the kitchen market. the rocketing prices have ensured i don't have to worry anymore about what i have to buy. life is so much easier now. besides, the increase has also given me something to think about when i am utterly bored. no matter how hard i try, i just cannot figure out the amazing percentage increase in the prices. it defies logic. i wonder how it can happen, but i don't have a clue. i feel proud to see some of my fellow countrymen trying their best to increase their profit from the kitchen market sale! at least someone will be happy this eid!
satirizing our beloved prophet (pbuh)!
recently i read a news in the daily inqilab that a teacher of dhanmondi boys' school made some unpleasant comments about our beloved prophet muhammad (pbuh). not only him, there are many people who satirize our beloved prophet (pbuh). the above mentioned daily is not subscribed by many, hence the news did not get due attention. our prophet said a muslim is not a muslim until he/she loves allah and his messenger (pbuh) more than anything else, even more than his/her parents. allah also says in surah tawba that if a person loves his family and friends more than allah and his messenger (pbuh), allah tells him to wait for his destruction. from this we learn that if we do not love our prophet we are not muslims. i request the daily star to report such incidents and i also urge the government to take strong initiatives against these unpleasant elements of the society.
hartal and media's role
the question posed by sir frank peters made us ponder. he said, “what would happen if a hartal were announced in bangladesh, but the media (television, radio and press) totally ignored it and would not give the announcement even a mention?” that's a challenging and stimulating question that deserves serious consideration. the opposition usually holds a press conference before calling a hartal. if the media collectively refused to convey the message, it's doubtful if the hartal would even get off the ground. hartal is most damaging to our economy and it is ruining our image abroad. what contribution is the media making towards mitigating the untold sufferings of innocent families who live from hand to mouth? maybe the media should reconsider its role.
is india a friend?
needless to say, sonia gandhi's recent visit to bangladesh played a very significant role in terms of improvement of relationship between the two countries and regarding their mutual concerns. and when it comes to establishing peace in border areas of bangladesh and india, this visit had a very important role to play. india is a friend of bangladesh, so security of bangladeshis should be their concern too. but what bsf is doing nowadays in border areas is not what a friend does.

transit in exchange for rivers?
river water sharing and transit are two major issues for the upcoming indian prime minister, dr. manmohan singh's visit to bangladesh. so far, these two issues have been kept separate, and bangladesh is focusing on duty, fees, etc. while considering the transit issue. this is a wrong approach. transit is a strategic issue. bangladesh should aim at some strategic gain in exchange for transit. bangladesh should offer a historic compromise of giving transit facilities to india in exchange for full flow of all shared rivers.
