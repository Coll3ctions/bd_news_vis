march 26
march 26 was the commencement of a nine-month long arduous resistance against a rapacious military that wanted to suppress the rights of the bengalis by force. never before in the annals of human history perhaps has there been such a diabolical attempt to deny the political rights of the majority by the minority, and never before has the majority been forced to the fight to reclaim their rights. and that led to what we saw so proudly emerge as an independent country not only as the symbol but also an affirmation of the political rights of the people of bangladesh.
a plea for limon
an entire year has passed since limon, a young hsc student from jhalakathi, was left crippled after being shot by rapid action battalion (rab) personnel for being a cohort of a criminal. so far no evidence has been provided to prove such an allegation. instead, two false cases have been filed against him, one under the arms act and another for 'preventing law enforcers from discharging their duties'. meanwhile limon has had to bear the agony of losing a leg just two weeks before his hsc examinations and then appearing in court for these cases against him. not only has his family had to bear the burden of the costs associated with his defense in court, limon, who would have been the bread earner of the family, has had all his dreams shattered. view the page sports

volatile political environment
this response was to an article in the pages of a local english daily on march18th, on the subject. our two major political parties are usually very adept in organising and carrying out disruptive activities. doing things constructively is unfortunately beyond their ken.
tigers have won our heart
though our team has failed to win the match, yet i salute them for what they have achieved in this tournament. it seems the tigers have united and played their role properly. at least, i can say now that bangladesh is not a team of 'one man army,' they are now a team of commandos! how tamim iqbal played was really exceptional. he has managed to score four 50s consecutively. shakib al hasan is the 'heart' of bangladesh cricket team. undoubtedly, he has won our heart once again by his extraordinary performance throughout the tournament.
permit import of one-day chick to protect consumers
believe it or not, in the retail market of dhaka, one egg is selling for tk.10. it is unprecedented in the country. only less than a dozen one-day chick breeders are mainly responsible for such sky-high price. the poultry farm owners, poultry feed producers and the government decision makers are partially responsible for this. the prices of poultry birds have become double. as the eggs and the poultry birds were relatively less costly, general people used to go for these options for meeting their protein need which are out of their reach now.
rehabilitation plan for beggars
we are happy to know that work is underway to rehabilitate 10,000 beggars of dhaka. primarily 2,000 beggars would be rehabilitated at their own hometowns, as social welfare minister enamul hoque mostofa shaheed told parliament recently. it is really encouraging that beggar rehabilitation cell of this ministry is planning to provide mobile shops, rickshaws, rickshaw-trolleys, sewing machines and money to start small business to the beggars capable of working. in addition, the cell will arrange motivational orientation classes for the beggars to infuse into them the inspiration to be self-dependent.
is it patriotism?
during the bangladesh-india asia cup match, suddenly we experienced load shedding. as bangladesh team was playing well and had a chance of winning, i listened to bangladesh betar to get the live commentary of the match. however, some patriotic songs were played at the same time with the commentary. it created a very chaotic situation. my point is, does bangladesh betar have to show so much patriotism denying its listeners the chance to hear the live commentary of a crucial cricket match? isn't watching our country play and supporting them from the core of the heart patriotism as well?
free the footpath in front of eden college
the footpath in front of eden mohila college is one of the busiest footpaths in the area. the footpath is used by all types of people. but now some hawkers have taken possession of the footpath creating trouble for the passers-by. they have already set up at least fifty small shops of cosmetics and clothes. at first there was only one shop but the number increased with the passage of time. female students of nearby educational institutions and housewives from azimpur colony gather there for shopping, as things are sold at a cheaper price here. it is very worrying to see that finding no other way the pedestrians walk on the main road (mirpur road). if any accident happens, who will take the responsibility? all the shops from this footpath should be evicted and it should be made free for pedestrians' use only.
wake up to reality
a person's real worth depends on his health, education and morality. similarly, a country's image depends on how strong its education, health and moral standards are. that day i took my mother to our local public hospital. doctors at the emergency prescribed medicine among which only saline was given free from the hospital. what is most troubling was that my emaciated old mother had to be taken to a distant diagnostic centre for the several necessary or unnecessary tests that the doctors usually give these days with a view to earning extra money.
reach a settlement over ctg issue
we have had enough unrest over the issue of the caretaker government; we do not want to suffer anymore; the government and the opposition political parties must come to an understanding as soon as possible. we think it is the duty of the government to see that the issue is settled in a way which is acceptable to the opposition because the ctg was formed to fulfil the demand of the awami league and was subsequently dissolved by them without any consultation with the opposition.
students' responsibility
parents send their children to universities for higher education hoping that one day they would be able to lead the country. most parents go through many difficulties to send money to their university-going children. regrettably, a good number of the students seem to become oblivious of their parents' hopes and expectations the moment they walk into the campus. they get involved in various destructive and virulent activities, even over trivial matters. clashes among students infuse tension not only in the parents but the nation as well.
shahadat's poor performance
after two consecutive victories over india and sri lanka, i had firm belief that bangladesh would do well in the final also. they played well undoubtedly, but came short by just 2 runs, disappointing millions. i feel that the person mainly responsible for this loss was shahadat who gave19 runs in the last over. he always puts pressure on other bowlers to check the runs. he had taken a hat-trick in one day international cricket previously, but his current form suggests that he has lost his control over his bowling. our selectors are so generous to shahadat but when it comes to nazmul, they are not considerate, although he plays much better than shahadat. i hope our selectors would be judicious in selecting the players in the future.

march 26 in retrospect
on this 41st independence day, it is time we had a fresh stocktaking of the past. the very remoteness of those tumultuous days of march 1971 has placed us at this vantage point to consider those from a dispassionate outlook.
the anniversary that brings joy and pain
the nation observes today the 41st anniversary of independence with usual zeal and gaiety, in spite of the deep frustration because of unfulfilled expectations. independence, gained at the cost of a sea of blood and sacrifices of millions, stays a symbol of hope and an eternal source of inspiration. it is a day of great joy and high spirits because the nation came into existence on this day.

first-hand account of operation searchlight
my heart bleeds when i vividly remember the tragic scenario of the fatal night of march 25, 1971. destiny goaded me into a stormy orbit of the country's journalism. after bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman was released from jail interned on the charge of the agartala conspiracy case, one day he suddenly stated, "i need an english language newspaper." looking at me he said, "abidur rahman, you were a journalist in early life, now god has given you enough recourses. you have to start an english language newspaper for me."
this day in history
march 26
1971
the commencement of a bloody nine-month long liberation war against the pakistan army that followed millions of deaths leading to the independence of bangladesh.
