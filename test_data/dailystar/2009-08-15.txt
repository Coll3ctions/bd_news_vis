as we recall bangabandhu . . .
on national mourning day, the fundamental thought in all of us is one of the tortuous course bangladesh has traversed since the assassination of bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman along with most members of his family in 1975. obviously, the death of the father of the nation through conspiracy hatched by elements intent on bringing back regressive politics in the country was a tragedy we have not yet been able to overcome, a wound that is yet to heal. the decades since august 15, 1975 have in effect been a time when the country has lurched from disaster to calamity owing to the various phases of extra-constitutional government imposed on the nation. of course there have been, since the early 1990s, elected civilian governments in place. and yet the feeling that the seismic shocks we went through when bangabandhu and subsequently four of his political associates were gunned down has not quite gone away.
enriching primary school textbooks
years of blasé attitude to school textbooks had up until recently been reflected through delayed publication schedules as books reached children well into an advancing academic session and, that too, with distorted textual contents in certain areas. but now it seems another dimension to the legacy of indifference has come to light. it's the poor quality production of textbooks making dull reading for our children that is now exercising the minds of our educators.
august 1975 and thereafter
what happened in august 1975 was a great tragedy perpetrated by an anti-people clique who did not want bangladesh to move in the direction its people had desired it to take. the desire embodied a dream and an ideology; and for its fulfillment the people had struggled not only in 1971 but even before. the long struggle did not begin all of a sudden. it had a glorious history of its own. in december 1971 it reached a point where it was impossible for the old state not to yield to the emergence of an independent bangladesh. what the assassins were bent upon doing was the bringing down not only of a great man but also, and not less importantly, of the ideology of secular bengali nationalism together with the dream of a long-awaited and urgently needed social revolution. sheikh mujibur rahman had promoted that collective desire among, and with, the people. in mourning his death we bemoan the loss of a leader as well as of an opportunity. sheikh mujib died a martyr, heading the long list of those who laid down their lives to liberate the people of bangladesh.
the day historical distortion set in
the assassination of the father of the nation on 15 august 1975 was but the first step in the distortion of national history. sit back and reflect on all the falsehoods that have been disseminated in these past thirty-four years by elements who have clearly derived benefits from what is truly the worst episode in free bangladesh's history. moments after the soldiers completed their macabre mission, it was given out on the radio that bangladesh had been declared an islamic republic. that, of course, was not true, as later events were to prove. but that the country had been forced at gunpoint to take a regressive step towards what would amount to communalism was made clear through the religious invocations of the killers. suddenly, the state did not appear to be for bengalis any more. the bengali battle cry of joi bangla was supplanted by the pakistan-inclined bangladesh zindabad. the broad hint was there that the largest religious community, in this case muslims, were in the ascendant.
basically a people's man
on this day in 1975, the father of the nation, bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman, was assassinated and the nation should be ashamed of the unpardonable failure of not being able to finish the trial processes of the killers even after the lapse of 34 years since his gruelsome killing.
bangabandhu remembered
as a child in the early sixties i first heard of bangabandhu from my father. he spoke affectionately of a gentleman named sheikh mujib, who gave fiery speeches in the paltan maidan against pakistani military dictator ayub khan and his henchman monem khan, the governor of east pakistan. he was brave as well as witty and was fond of east bengal (east pakistan) and her people to a fault. fighting for the rights of his deprived people was the greatest passion of his life. often he went to jail. but my father was not sure if sheikh shaheb would be finally successful and come to power one day to establish democratic rule in pakistan and serve its suffering people, especially those of east pakistan. needless to mention i instantly began to like sheikh mujibur rahman, simply because no one else championed the bengali cause like him. i started to follow his activities through newspapers. along with brazilian football, west indian cricket and sub-continental hockey, a child of the sixties began to admire sheikh mujib. slowly but surely he became my favourite politician. by march 1971 bangladesh and sheikh mujib became synonyms. view the page sports
winning streak ends
zimbabwe's batting has improved with each outing this series, and yesterday they kept their hopes alive with a victory in bulawayo that brought bangladesh's winning run to a screeching halt. on a flat batting track of the queens park, the hosts briefly threatened to combust in another jittery display from the top order, but hamilton masakadza lit up the innings with a maiden odi century, supported by a calm brendan taylor and a gung-ho elton chigumbura. zimbabwe were in control when chigumbura joined taylor in the 39th over, and what proceeded to unfold turned a solid batting act into an exhibition of butchery.

august 15 and the transformation of bangladesh
bangabandhu's assassination on 15 august 1975 prematurely deprived bangladesh of its founding father at a time when the process of nation building was still incomplete. this event both destabilized and created a fissure within the nation which has not yet been bridged. this division and destabilization of the polity deflected bangladesh from the course set by its liberation struggle which had provided the basis for the foundational principles of the bangladesh constitution: democracy, nationalism, secularism and socialism. since that fateful day in august, each of these foundational principles has been exposed to contestation or even outright repudiation. this assault on the very principles of our nationhood has destabilised the nation, compromised the working of our democratic institutions and thereby weakened the process of governance. it could, thus, be argued that the bullets which killed bangabandhu were also intended to destroy the very idea of bangladesh for which the liberation war was waged. let us briefly explore these long-term consequences which emanated from the events of 15 august 1975.
bangabandhu at the helm and 1972
on the 34th anniversary of the brutal assassination of bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman, the father of the nation, and many members of his immediate family, i will recall the historic role that he played as the master helmsman during 1972 and how he safely guided our ship through troubled waters amidst a devastated post-war scenario. i will do so because many have forgotten his significant role and his commitment towards democracy and institution building.
realising bangabandhu's poverty-free shonar bangla
history is at last taking its own course and putting bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman, the father of the nation, in his rightful place. gradually, he is emerging as the only reference point of our nationhood and we must congratulate the high court bench for removing the confusion created by some motivated vested interest groups including, unfortunately, some academics.

monday morning sickness
one sunday a few weeks back i was at a party where i heard that author salman rushdie had offended some students, particularly those from india, with a speech he gave at tufts university. he had apparently made a reference to the fact that while the number of deities in the various religions in india was fixed, the population has been growing since ancient times, thus causing an imbalance. according to ashfaq, a faculty member of the tufts school of medicine, who attended the rushdie meeting, some of the students and teachers got up and left in protest. as i was listening to ashfaq's account of the tufts event, i felt sorry that i had passed up the opportunity to hear and meet rushdie in person. i recall receiving an email from my daughter, who is a tufts alumna, and who, in deference to my admiration for rushdie, had not only forwarded the announcement from tufts, but had asked me if i would be interested to go. as alum, she was entitled to a ticket, which she was willing to give up for me. i had declined the offer because the tufts university campus was an hour's drive from my house, and the event took place on a sunday afternoon and it would have been followed by a reception. if i had gone to the speech and the subsequent reception, i was afraid that i wouldn't have been able to get back home before midnight and thereby suffer the inevitable consequences of such misadventures, the dreaded monday morning sickness, as we call it.
the vanished niltunis
i first noticed the pair of niltunis several years ago perched on a high branch of a tall yellow-and-crimson hibiscus tree in our inner courtyard. i had never seen one before in my life, and did not know what they were called. it was only a year or so later that i came across a feature story, accompanied by photographs, in a bengali newspaper, which described the life of niltunis, and thus got to know its name. there was no mistaking the similarity between the pair in the picture and the pair i had espied. to this day, i do not know them by any other name than ' niltuni. ' they look like hummingbirds, with long, narrow and slightly curved beaks, but the niltunis are larger by comparison.
a farewell to the city
i am leaving toronto. after arduous federal government exams (the preparation for which doesn't leave time for anything else) a position in education is mine at last, but at the cost of my beloved city. the new position is in edmonton, the capital of alberta, at the western end of canada and the distance is not inconsiderable - equivalent to roughly the miles between the distance between dhaka and tehran. the new position means travel to the northwest territories as well as the pacific province of british columbia. the spirit of travel in me has re-awakened by the lure of rocky mountains and the call of the north, but my heart, i fear will remain in my city, the city of toronto.

a bewitchingly beautiful dream glazes their eyes. and

treatment of tuberculosis involves taking tablets daily for at least six months. tb patients must take all their medications as prescribed, failing which they may not recover and dangerous drug-resistant tb strains may develop. that is why it is considered ideal for tb patients to come to a treatment facility to take their tablets in the presence of a health worker — at least in the early, intensive phase of the treatment.

president obama's visit to ghana: a reward for democracy and good governance
the white house's choice of ghana for us president obama's visit to africa triggered envy across the continent. kenya, where obama's father lived and died, expected the visit of the president first. other countries such as south africa, nigeria and liberia thought that the president would visit one of those countries first, but not ghana.
the 'vision thing'
leadership vision is what propels nations to greatness. across the world, roosevelt, churchill, deng, mandela and obama are considered examples of leaders with vision. ashoka's peace offensive, akbar's inclusivism, nehru's development model, the 'indira doctrine', rajiv's call towards the twenty-first century and vp singh's egalitarian initiative are examples closer home. examples from the recent past include narasimha rao's stewardship of liberalization and vajpayee's reaching out to pakistan, thrice in his tenure, rates as consistency in vision despite the gravest tests. view the page star books review
books on the life, career and times of bangabandhu
on his final night alive, hours before he was assassinated, bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman spent time reading george bernard shaw's man and superman. thirty four years after the murder of the father of the nation, and the members of his family, syed badrul ahsan makes note of some of the books that have been written about bangabandhu since 1975. of course, there are other books as well. but the offering here is a sample of the vast literature which has grown up around the historical personality of bangladesh's founding father.
