transparency in governance
i wanted to write about honesty in politics, but then i realised there could not be a bigger oxymoron than this concept. honesty and politics are like oil and water, at least that has been our national experience. politicians mask their actions with rhetoric aimed to please the public, or delude them. george orwell once remarked: "political language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind." this is where a statesman or national leader differs from a run of the mill politician. then this is expected of the politicians, and we should not be surprised by this dichotomy in their speech and actions. a statesman uses truth to keep power in the hands of the people while a politician uses euphemism to gain power over the people.

scientific research in bangladesh: new opportunities
much of the relevancy of science to man and to society arises by way of technology. science and technology (s&t) complement each other via complex, two-way interaction. science brings reason and enlightenment, and provides ideas for technological innovations, which improve the quality of life. technology, in turn, provides science with new tools and instruments for doing research, for the storage and dissemination of information and for stimulation of further research. this organic process has led to fundamental scientific breakthroughs in the 20th century, which has unleashed a technological revolution of such unprecedented scope and power that today, for the first time in human history, we have the know-how to ensure that no human being is poor, uneducated and lacks the basic health care necessary to lead a decent life.
