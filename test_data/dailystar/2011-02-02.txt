fate of school bus service
i was very happy to learn about the introduction of buses meant for the school children. to me personally it seemed like the best thing that ever happened in this country after achieving independence in 1971. no doubt it is a milestone achievement in the transportation sector. the next day while reading my favorite daily, to my utter dismay i came across the frustrating front page picture, displaying general passengers riding on the bus meant for the school children. i simply wonder when this nation shall become civilized, or shall we remain rustic forever? while staying in houston, i witnessed with great amazement, the school buses carrying students are the vips in true sense traveling on the streets. no one blocks their path, it is against the law. it is the priority vehicle number one on the street. since i did not have the opportunity of coming across any presidential motorcade, while in houston, i think by all means school buses are the number one vehicles plying the streets. this emphasizes the degree of importance attached to education, students, teachers and all those related to it. why can't we learn the good things from others?
