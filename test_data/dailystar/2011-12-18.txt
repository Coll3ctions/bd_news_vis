artistic talent
the ongoing group art exhibition of radius art gallery is praiseworthy for its selection of works. through the exhibits of a number of major contemporary painters' one can easily comprehend the current trends of bangladeshi art. the painters have used varied styles and approaches. it is true that our painters have a great fascination with both pure abstraction and pure realism. however, it was evident that most of the painters failed to get a perspective of social injustice, political volatility and other contemporary issues. themes could have been more connected with society, where one can get easily locate the social realities. it is commonly said “art is the mirror of the society”, and art assists common people to be more conscious about his society and its varied aspects. but the current exhibition is far from that.

russia's accession to the wto

dead reckoning : disappearing stories and evidence
the 40th anniversary of the liberation of bangladesh is special not simply because it marks the passing of decades, but because of the current passionate attempt to recapture the founding spirit of the nation. the recent debates on the constitution and an attempt to return it to its original secular character of 1972 are vital to the future survival of the country. but the hurried changes made, with an ultimate outcome of keeping islam as the state religion, have disappointed many. in contrast, the war crimes trials that are underway still offer hope.
the winter of our content
for most people around the world, december is a time for celebration and joy, for remembrance and forgiveness, and for hope and revival. for bangladeshis, december is particularly significant because it is the month we became a free nation; it is a time when our spirits are reignited. after all, had december 16th not happened where would many of us be now? would i be in virginia, united states writing this column and remembering my motherland with deep fondness? perhaps, i would still be a rudderless, dislocated person living in “nowhere land.” but, today, wherever we arein freezing canada or sunny dubaiwe have a solid identity, thanks to the invaluable sacrifices of our heroes who gifted us with a homeland.
