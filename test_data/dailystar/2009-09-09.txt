js in session again, without the opposition
the jatiyo sangsad began its third session on monday. to no one's surprise, the opposition bangladesh nationalist party kept up the boycott of proceedings it began months ago as a way of highlighting its grievances. among those grievances are the grouse of the party's lawmakers about seating arrangements in the house and about the notice served on the leader of the opposition relating to vacating her cantonment residence. it is now quite clear that on a solution to these problems, one to the bnp's liking, hinges the question of its return to the house. for the nation as well as for those who voted the party's lawmakers into legislative office, it is a most unfortunate situation. for the nation, the boycott is increasingly looking like an attempt to make the js an ineffectual and therefore an uninspiring body. and for its supporters, the bnp by not going to parliament is giving out the negative message that its politics has taken on a cavalier hue and that it pays little or no heed to their interests.

footpaths

organic farming
"while the farmer holds the title to the land, actually, it belongs to all the people because civilization itself rests upon the soil." --thomas jefferson.
student politics

power generation and pollution
an unrealistic suggestion for power generation for bangladesh was published in a local english daily on august 29,which was theoretically rational and possible elsewhere. however, given the reality of heavy rain and floods in bangladesh, the idea is not feasible here. investigations on computer modelling based on bangladesh weather data, indicates that in bangladesh we can harvest at most 25 percent of available annual sunlight for power generation!

diplomats and traffic
it is not my habit to write blistering missives to editors. however, the appalling attack by shabbir a. bashar, (phd, vancouver, usa) on the community of diplomats in dhaka is such that i feel compelled to reply, if only to prevent certain of his assertions from passing into local lore as fact.
trial of war criminals
the law and parliamentary affairs minister recently announced in unequivocal terms (the daily star, 28.08.09) that there was no foreign pressure in regard to the issue of the trial of war criminals, which directly contradicts the claim of the local govt. minister who had said that there was pressure from abroad.
government's plan
we have seen a report in the national dailies that the government will give jobs to about one lakh unemployed people under a national service, a special project. the government manifesto was that at least one unemployed man or woman from each family would get a job. we have heard that the name of the project reflects the overall plan.
good work
i must congratulate bdjobs for introducing the best employer award in different categories. this will definitely encourage other organisations to improve the work environment.
lamb and wolf story?
the tug of war between the mayor of rajshahi and the chairman education board reminds me of a story the moral of which is “rogues must have some plea.” the story runs like “a lamb was drinking water from a spring. suddenly a wolf appeared overhead and barged in rudely at the lamb, “why are you muddying my water ” “how it is possible sir, you are at the upstream and i am at the downstream !” the lamb bleated timidly. “then you called me names,” the wolf nagged still forcefully. “how long ago sir?” “the lamb wondered miserably. “the wolf asserted,” “a year ago” “sir i am only six months old. i was not born a year ago.” the lamb tried to correct the wolf. “ then your father did so.” with this the wolf allowed no chance for any further defence from the lamb. he jumped on it and made a feast on it. the analogy may not be misplaced!
brutal police action
we condemn the brutal police action on the people who were marching towards the petrobangla office at karwan bazaar to protest the government's decision to award three offshore blocks to international oil companies. the members of the national committee to protect oil, gas, mineral resources, power and ports were present at the protest rally. we learned that more than 50 people were injured by the police assault and both legs of anu muhammad, a professor of economics of jahangirnagar university, were badly fractured.
four-day workweek
“the four-day workweek is winning fans” by bryan walsh that appeared online (time magazine) is really interesting to share. bryan wrote: “in an era when most of us seem to be working more hours than ever provided we're still lucky enough to have jobs, 17,000 people in utah have embarked on an unusual experiment. a year ago, the beehive state became the first in the us to mandate a four-day workweek for most state employees, closing offices on fridays in an effort to reduce energy costs. the move is different from a furlough in that salaries were not cut; nor was the total amount of time employees work. they pack in 40 hours by starting earlier and staying later four days a week. but on that fifth (glorious) day, they don't have to commute, and their offices don't need to be heated, cooled or lit. after 12 months, utah's experiment has been deemed so successful that a new acronym could catch on: tgit (thank god it's thursday). the state found that its compressed workweek resulted in a 13% reduction in energy use and estimated that employees saved as much as $6 million in gasoline costs. altogether, the initiative will cut the state's greenhouse-gas emissions by more than 12,000 metric tons a year. and perhaps not surprisingly, 82% of state workers say they want to keep the new schedule.”
swine flu
nowadays, swine flu has become a serious threat to the world as well as to our country. it can turn into an epidemic in no time. still the people of our country seem to be indifferent to the harsh truth. rather, our health minister asked us not to be worried about it as an adequate quantity of drugs has been stocked up. view the page international
