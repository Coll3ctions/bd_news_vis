another global arms race?
the end of the world war ii saw the world divided between two power blocks the west led by the us and its nato allies representing elected democracies, and the east led by the soviet union and the warsaw pact countries representing marxist-socialist states. although the soviet union and the west fought together against the axis powers, they fell apart soon after the war on ideological issues that translated into a global struggle for power and influence. the so-called “cold war” started; its beginning marked somewhat by winston churchill's “iron curtain” speech on 5 march 1946 in a small college in fulton, missouri, usa, where he said, "from stettin in the baltic to trieste in the adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent."

tagore and the japanese experience
rabindranath tagore (1861-1941), one of the most widely travelled persons of his age, visited japan three times: in 1916, in 1924 and in 1929. it is worth mentioning here that rabindranath's visits may be counted as five since on his away back in 1916 and 1929 he landed in japan. before him, we had some more people from the bangla-language zone visiting japan and writing on different aspects of the country, but rabindranath's visit became a milestone in the timeline of japan-bengal, i.e., japan-india relations. during his five tours the myriad-minded author met a huge number of people, from the prime mmnister of japan to lesser mortals, among whom were writers, artists, musicians, educationists, politicians, and journalists he delivered a good number of lectures and befriended a number of japanese. all his lectures, explanations, references and related information have been bound in two covers by supriya roy, a dedicated worker of the rabindra-bhabana, the tagore memorial museum and archive and research centre of visva-bharati, santiniketan, india.
those ailing public universities
the book under review is a pioneering work in the area of corruption in public universities in bangladesh, although corruption and public universities are both old institutions in bangladesh. this work basically originated as a research report on corruption in the public universities sponsored by transparency international bangladesh and conducted by muhammad yeahia akhter. the author himself is a professor at a premier public university in the country and has been working in the area of corruption studies in bangladesh. transparency international bangladesh (tib) also is a very familiar and prominent organization working in the area of corruption. tib has been working very sincerely in this field in the form of conducting research on corruption at the macro and micro levels in the country. it has focused on many nationally important institutions and organizations, such as the chittagong port, government ministries, departments, etc., and on preparing reports, publishing them and disseminating systematically gathered information to the public. muhammad yeahia akhter also has done other work on corruption in bangladesh and has published books on diverse issues in this area of national importance. the present work therefore is the result of a laborious effort on the part of both tib and the author.

memories of an erudite man
a fortunate concatenation of circumstances has enabled this reviewer to know about and meet some of the most famous literary and intellectual personalities of bangladesh and west bengal since the 1950s. among them is syed mujtaba ali. and because of this chain of circumstances and blessed by good fortune, i was able to attend the wedding ceremony, in 1951, of syed mujtaba ali with rabiah aly, who was my mother's friend and classmate. and then, only last week, quite by happenstance, i came across golam mostaquim, who presented me with his book on syed mujtaba ali (first published in 1995). this memoir of syed mujtaba ali by a 'civil savant' is an unlikely delight. mostaquim is now a senior officer in the bangladesh administration, but i have known him for long, as he hails from my ancestral home, the sub-divisional town of manikganj, now a district headquarters.
