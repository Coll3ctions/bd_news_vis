climate finance in south asia
it is now well recognised that impacts of climate change will have significant economic costs on the affected countries. cost of inaction will also be enormous compared to the cost of mitigation and adaptation. though there is controversy about the cost estimates due to the uncertainty on the magnitude of the problem, most studies indicate that the economic cost of climate change is very high. according to the famous stern review prepared by sir nicholas stern on the “the economic cost of climate change” published in 2006, the cost of inaction is 5 percent of global gdp each year and the upper case estimate is 20 percent of gdp or even more. poor countries will face in excess of 10 percent of gdp with 5-6°c warming by the end of the century. on the other hand, william nordhaus has estimated that due to 3°c increase in temperature and precipitation there will be a cost equivalent to 3 percent of global gdp.
can saarc make a difference?
talking about faeces or latrine is neither romantic nor attractive for both politicians and media. but it is a reality in south asia where more than one billion people simply don't have toilet to perform their natural functions. many men, women and children still defecate in open places which are highly undignified. they are exposed to severe health risks, violence and adding to environmental pollution. majority of schools in all the countries of south asia don't have adequate toilets and hand washing facilities for students, hence a chance to change behaviour in next generation is missing out. view the page literature

of values that used to be, of culture that yet remains
old values are what syed moqsud ali speaks of in this narrative of what has been a fruitful life. in a work that encompasses an entirety of a family tale, the writer in essence brings forth all the traditions, as it were, that once were an underpinning of life in this country. these are the writer's memoirs and yet they could be interpreted as expressions of the sentiments that have bound bengali families and clans together for ages. all history begins with the personal before broadening out to a wider swath of experience. and that is the point which ali makes at the beginning of his narrative. he goes out in search of his roots and comes away from the density of tradition enriched in terms of his discovery. it is discovery that most, if not all, of us can relate to. there is that identification not just with class but with the accompaniments of aspirations which come with it as well.
