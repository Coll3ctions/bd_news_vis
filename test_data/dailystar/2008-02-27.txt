investigating corruption in the military
the chairman of the anti-corruption commission has clearly expressed the readiness of the acc to inquire into corruption in the military. the reiteration of such an intent by general hasan mashhud chowdhury points to the purposefulness of the campaign against overall wrongdoing the acc is engaged in. it is certainly a commendable move, one that citizens in general and the armed forces in particular should welcome in the larger national interest. one reason why such a step is to be appreciated is the fact that it promises to add substance to the on-going drive against corruption in government, indeed in all areas that relate to the public weal.

the recent irresponsible acts of a group of danish journalists are highly unethical, to say the least. when the world community raises their voice against war and injustice and try hard to make peace and love, these people are trying to spread poison.
power players
it is time that all the former power players of our country took stock of how much they have contributed to the well-being of the people of this country.
bttb
the front page report (feb: 16) in an english daily on the tariff competition being faced by bttb states that their land line call charges are likely to be cut further! bttb had the monopoly for long, with a carefree and complacent attitude. now they are waking up to the reality of competitive and rapidly growing private mobile phone companies. their age long passivity can no longer carry on. possibly the fact of life has come alive for bttb. even their mobile venture, for lack of expansion and the red tape involved in getting it, has not helped them! action and aggressive marketing cannot be the "cup of tea" for the static monopoly, that is bttb. bttb's well established multi-layered bureaucracy can not just be wished away overnight. they will overshadow and stall matters; meanwhile the private sector multidirectional competition is racing along, changing day by day as the market and situation demands. this may well usher in the downfall of landline telephony of bttb; while their revenues from this sector will go on declining! the same situation may be faced by the postal wing of bttb, as more and more courier services are proliferating .
rab
although many may argue about the necessity of torture in extreme situation when life of innocent victims are on the line (i.e. in case one needs to find out the location or plan of any imminent mass-destructive effort like bomb or terror plots), just being a suspect does not warrant wholesale torture. only the criminal should fear rab, others should see them as a resource, a symbol of benevolent power. power calls for responsibility. i urge the government of bangladesh to take two basic steps as a supplement to existing training programme for the rab members, both for ranks and files. it's absolutely necessary that they go through a continuous briefing on ethics and compassion. rab members should understand that they are not the power as individuals; rather, they are the medium through which power is projected.
asian women leaders
some asian women leaders make themselves refreshingly different and attractive with their clothes, hair styles, shoes, ornaments and also manners. their fashions not only work as a very powerful force in society but reflect change, development, prosperity and advancement of women. for example, benazir bhutto, the former prime minister of pakistan, was regarded as one of the fashion icons for her sartorial features-- black coat on shalwar-kamiz and black shoes. she gained huge popularity among young women in the subcontinent.
bangla in bad shape!
bravo! mr. badrul ahsan for your well thought out editorial piece (6 feb wed) on bangla. it's about time somebody had a go at it. i totally concur with all your points. in fact you might also like to read my piece on the same subject in the daily star monthly forum (june 2007). it's a national, cultural and intellectual disgrace that we are a nation quick to shed tears and blood, quick to lament on the language issue (like no other nation), and equally quick to forget all that and embrace some foreign colloquialisms, and quick to demolish what little bangla there is. to watch some reporters (or indeed some high profile personalities) on tv wrestling with the pronunciation of some words, is to wonder why on earth did we have ekushey at all.
sweet drinks and gout
sugary drinks have been blamed for a surge in cases of the painful joint disease gout. men who consume two or more sugary soft drinks a day have an 85 per cent higher risk of gout compared with those who drink less than one a month, a study suggests. cases in the u.s. have doubled in recent decades and it seems fructose, a type of sugar, is to blame, the british medical journal study reports. uk experts said those with gout would be advised to cut out sugary drinks. the symptoms of painful, swollen joints, mainly in the lower limbs, are caused when uric acid crystallises out of the blood into the joints.
car parking
sometimes i need to drop my daughter at brac university at mohakhali and every time i gain bitter experience while parking the vehicle, and at times parking has to be made far away from the university building. not only this, my driver's experience is more shocking as he faces a terrible situation in the morning while several students of the university arrive at a given time. moreover, fear of possible police harassment is also there for wrong parking. the front parking place always remains congested due to heavy traffic and pedestrian movement as well as haphazard parking on the other side of the road.
us presidential election
of late the daily telegraph in britain suggested not to count al gore completely out of the presidential picture of the united states. obviously, more recently the momentum has shifted to barack obama after a string of primary and caucus victories. however, the clinton camp purportedly believes that if obama doesn't deliver a knock-out blow before the march 4 primaries in texas and ohio, hillary could win those races and regain the momentum, with many super delegates uniting behind her to preserve party unity.
