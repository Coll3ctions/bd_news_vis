endangered police chain of command
that law and order has deteriorated in the country over these past many weeks and months has never been in question. and now that even senior police officers have acknowledged the situation, there are additional reasons to be worried about the state of things. what is indeed gravely disturbing is the new dimension which seems to have come into the picture. these police officials have pointed to what is clearly a break in the police chain of command owing to the close ties many of their subordinates maintain with political, usually ruling party, activists across the country. indeed, the revelations made at a quarterly crime conference in the capital on wednesday are but a confirmation of the politicization which has for long characterized the police service. there is not much that is new about the situation, but of late matters have clearly gone out of hand. when junior officers have the gall to defy the instructions of their superiors merely because they enjoy close ties with local political elements, it is a signal of danger for the country.

rainwater preservation
citizens of dhaka are suffering due to the present water crisis. still, some respite can be found through an easy but convenient method - preserving rainwater. here are a few important points in this regard:
urban transport
an article on this important subject was published in a local daily on 27 april. this should attract the attention of the relevant government authorities. commuter transport in and around dhaka is becoming more chaotic day by day!
digital bangladesh and power
these days, very often, we hear about digital bangladesh. before our general election 2009 we did not hear anything about digital bangladesh. we only heard about sonar bangla.
activities of bcl
this refers to the news 'stop bcl's criminal activities' by your rajshahi correspondent published on 27 april. fifteen teachers of rajshahi university expressed deep concern over the “criminal activities” of bangladesh chhatra league at educational institutions and urged the government to take immediate steps in this regard. they felt that this anarchic situation is infiltrating into the state activities like cancer.
rehab's obligations
rehab's cooperation is necessary to save the dying dhaka from overcrowding effects. new official regulations may be promulgated for implementation by rehab members (the house-building construction companies) in the following areas:
tobacco cultivation in cht
tobacco cultivation in chittagong hill tracts (cht) is posing a threat to public health and the environment.
agriculture sector
agricultural production in bangladesh is highly influenced by different seasonal climatic variables such as high fluctuations of day and night temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, high carbon dioxide concentrations, humidity and day-length. it is also adversely affected by different climatic disasters such as floods, cyclones, storm surges and sea level rise.
prostitution and drug abuse
an article in the largest circulating daily newspaper of sweden (dagens nyheter, page 18, april 18, 2010) related to the drug use among the prostitutes of bangladesh has generated a lot of discussions among bangladeshis living in sweden. prostitution, regarded as the oldest profession, is practiced worldwide, not just in bangladesh. the article, based upon a report of an ngo, emphasizes the role of a powerful steroid oradexon in making young girls (often between 12-14 years of age) more mature (older than the officially allowed age of 18) and sexually attractive to the customers. this in return brings more profit to the brothel owners. the drug, used by majority of bangladeshi female sex workers, has serious side effects and is hazardous to health. the scene portrayed in the article is indeed a pathetic one as these young girls, often lured away from their villages, to work as sex slaves are locked up in a prison like environment. the article should reach the bangladeshi authorities who should look into the matter seriously and must take appropriate measures. after all, the article portrays a very negative image of bangladesh.
may day and workers
the historical importance of may day is great. labourers of america demanded 8-hour working time in 1886. in that gathering, police fired and some of the labourers were killed. we remember their great sacrifice on this day.
human development
human developments are about much more than the increase in national incomes. it is about create surroundings in which citizens can lead a prosperous life.
our culture
every nation has its individual art and culture and it is followed by the nation with pride. as the people of bangladesh, we do have our own art and culture and we love it. our culture has survived through our tradition and we retain it inside us. but what is horrifying to see is that nowadays, with the intrusion of western culture, our tradition and culture is on the decline. now the young generation is obsessed with western music and films.
deadly fungus!
according to a recent research report an airborne deadly fungus - cryptococcus gattii is spreading among humans and animals in the northeastern united states and the canadian province of british columbia. this new genetically different fungus strain is capable of causing serious health problems to humans as well as animals (cats, dogs, dolphins, etc.). c.gattii enters into the human body through inhalation of spores of the fungus. c. gattii infections include persistent cough (lasting for weeks or months), fever, shortness of breath, sinusitis, severe headache, nausea, night sweats, photophobia, skin problems, et cetera. the good news is, c.gattii is not transmitted from person to person or animal to person. an open wound may be a route for intrusion of the deadly fungus into the human and animal body system.
using cell phone
late dr. mohammad shahidullah was very correct in saying " disease is contagious not health". the other day i went to a bank to collect money sent from abroad. there was a long queue at the counter. from a little distance, i could very well see the teller at the counter was talking on her cell phone. after she finished talking, she attended the next customer on line. after some time, she again got back to her cell phone and the process continued like this making the queue bigger and bigger.
thanks to the pm!
kudos to our prime minister for taking the decision to ban films of the subcontinent in our country. it will facilitate protection of local films and job security to the people engaged in the industry. may i submit one more request to her: please impose restrictions on advertisements displaying foreign models in our media, signboards and billboards. in the name of free market economy, some multinational companies are displaying indian models ignoring our popular showbiz models.
dealing with power shortage
we, the people of bangladesh, are now in the middle of an energy crisis and each of us needs to do something to ensure that we have electricity, and that the economy can continue to run.
