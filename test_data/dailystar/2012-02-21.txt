capitalism is evolving, but into what?
like any “ism,” capitalism is a social construct; capitalism is only a term for what capitalists tend to believe and do. beyond a few fundamentals -- that it puts faith in markets as the best way to allocate resources, that it depends on private ownership of property, that it features mechanisms for accumulating capital to fund endeavours larger than individuals can undertake alone -- very little about it is set in stone. this is why we often hear phrases suggesting different styles of capitalism: “capitalism with chinese characteristics,” for example, or “northern european social capitalism.” no surprise, then, that capitalism is subject to change. view the page metropolitan

conservation of language
heritage does not solely mean something concrete in structure, there are some intangible heritages and one of them is language. language is the most powerful instrument of preserving and developing our tangible and intangible heritage.
power of love, and love of power
every good election contributes something to folklore. uttar pradesh is the land of lore; and the turbulence of its politicians is matched only by the sardonic wit of its voters. the culture of the sons of awadh has many dimensions, but a principal inheritance is the nuance of language, both written and verbal. awadhis can turn a conversation into a duel of scalpels, interspersed with the stiletto stab that penetrates just enough to puncture an ego without hurting the flesh. cut and thrust are an art form, not a westerner's duel at high noon. the sophisticate leaves invisible scars; he does not kill. that would be vulgar. the poet prefers to die a thousand deaths rather than injure a feckless or faithless lover; he might be tempted to ambush a rival but he would never waylay.

possibility of life on europa
scientists are strongly speculating (backed by the 1995 galileo spacecraft mission's findings) that europa, the smallest of the four galilean satellites and the 6th closest moon of the planet jupiter house a liquid ocean underneath its solid icy crust. that cosmic mission discovered that underneath the icy crust of europa, lies salty ocean which is kept warm by tidally generated heat and volcanic activities. it is believed that the biggest of europa's craters are surrounded by concentric rings and these rings are likely to be filled with ice. and there is a possibility that this outer crust of ice is approximately 100km thick where only the top 10km are frozen solid which ushers the great possibility of the existence of a global ocean in a liquid form and at least 62 miles deep beneath these icy crust. and chances are, wherever there is water, there will be life. but what kind of life it would be in europa that is a matter of great research. but some ideas are already there.
