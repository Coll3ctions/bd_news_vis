toxic ships in bangladesh waters
the entry of sixteen toxic ships into bangladesh waters, despite clear high court orders prohibiting such entry, is a matter which arouses the concern of every citizen. as a report in friday's issue of this newspaper makes clear, the shipping and environment departments have obviously seen little reason not to let these ships in. it is here that one wonders: are these departments at all aware of the legal moves taken in the recent past to keep such toxic vessels away from bangladesh or have they simply decided on their own that high court directives matter little and can easily be flouted? the sixteen ships in question have been given no objection certificates (nocs) by the shipping authorities and are therefore now busy with the task of scrapping. perhaps the issue would not have come to light had the bangladesh environmental lawyers association (bela) not kept track of circumstances. the organization has served a legal notice on those responsible for issuing the nocs despite the clear, unambiguous high court orders relating to the issue.

proper role of the central bank
the recent initiative of the united states federal reserve to stimulate economic growth by injecting some $600 billion through the purchase of us treasury bonds, known as the "quantitative easing" (qe2), has generated considerable controversy and debate both abroad and in the usa. the concern abroad is that this would cause their currencies to appreciate against the dollar and thereby reduces their export competitiveness. the outside world, which holds a lot of the us treasury debt instruments, also worries that this policy will inflict capital losses by inflating the us economy and lowering the real value of these dollar debt instruments. the concern in the us is that the fiscal deficit is already very high ($1.3 trillion or 8.9 percent of gdp); this action will further raise the budget deficit and also increase inflationary expectations.

tilting buildings of bangladesh!
centuries after the leaning tower of pisa was built, we in bangladesh are determined to build many tilting buildings in the many urban areas of bangladesh! the easy way out seems to be to pass the blame on building designers! the reality is however something very much different! it starts as a case of 'ignorance is bliss'; with economy drive being the sole criteria of work! to begin with, ground clearance between adjacent buildings, which is quite important, is ignored! every one wants to occupy as much land as possible, and the important clearances between built-up areas are ignored! unlike dhaka and may be chittagong, there are no rajuk like organisation to give approval, after taking into consideration these factors!

parliamentary democracy

utter disrespect for law!
as soon as anyone comes out on the street, he or she is sure to be confronted with this phenomenal problem. it seems there is no respite from it. no one is willing to abide by the law; be he a rickshaw puller, truck driver, bus driver or car driver; everybody behaves in the same manner. everybody wants to go ahead of the other, no matter whether it is right or wrong. even a rickshaw puller, knowing very well that he cannot go faster than a motor vehicle, would, by all possible mean, try to overtake the car in front, in a bid to establish his supremacy over it.
dhaka university campus
dhaka university is one of the leading public universities of the country. but it is a matter of regret that the campus environment is going from bad to worse day by day. the university is situated in the middle of the city. as a result, the campus is always overcrowded. the roads are always busy with rickshaws, microbuses, ambulances and even local buses. road accident is regular news. there are about 100 rickshaw garages in the campus. besides, there are a large number of unhygienic roadside food shops. there is no place left for the du students to sit, because outsiders gather everywhere. roads are dirty and also in a bad condition. du campus is now a place for the vagabonds, beggars, rickshaw-pullers and drug addicts.

usa's economic woe
the root cause of america's unprecedented economic recession is the non-performing home loan. so-called 'sub-prime'- loan i.e. lending to a borrower of poor credit history with high flexible interest rate was made assuming abnormal degree of non-payment risk. again, mainly basing on banks' huge home-loan business different kind of non-bank financial and non-bank, non-financial institutions in great number, such as realtor, processor, discounter, underwriter, insurer, re-insurer, inspectors' firm, service agency, title agency, closing agency etc. appeared and started playing in the market. derivative financial products like bond, share, debenture etc. were assiduously structured and floated in the market. most of the banks including the mega ones started to fail one after another due to capital and reserve inadequacy.
showing tolerance
we watched in the media how begum khaleda zia broke down at her gulshan office as she was evicted from her cantonment residence where she had lived for nearly four decades. whether the eviction was legal or not is not my concern. it is clear that she loved the house very much and that is quite natural.

no cheeky diplomacy please!
a new war has broken out in the world. its cause is not clear and its effect is yet to be understood. it cannot be called a cyber war. yet cyberspace is the domain which is used to carry out all the belligerence. the war so far looks asymmetric. here, the big powers looks the weakest and most vulnerable. on the other hand, a single organisation called wikileaks is the empire which is striking with full force. the pace at which wikileaks is striking is simply phenomenal. the world powers are seemingly dazed and in a cyber stupor.
