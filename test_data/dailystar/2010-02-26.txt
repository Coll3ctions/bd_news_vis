restoring normal conditions in the hills
there is yet a good deal more that must be done for normal conditions in the chittagong hill tracts to be restored. news reports of road and waterways blockades being put up by agitated people (and the latest concerns a group of bengali settler students) are a huge damper on efforts to restore confidence among the population in khagrachhari and rangamati, enough to convince them that they can resume their normal life. at least six people, we understand, have been killed in the violence and scores of arrests have been made. that in itself is a sign of the grave nature of the situation. when you add to that the figures for the number of families affected, 94 in all, and the number of homes razed to the ground, 500 altogether (of which 400 happen to be those of the adivasis), it is easy to imagine the bitterness that must have caused tragedy on such a scale.
