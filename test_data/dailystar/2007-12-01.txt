parvez musharraf's civilian facade
parvez musharraf has finally hung his military uniform to add a civilian touch to his second term in office as the president of an embattled pakistan. discernibly it was a move to appease his opponents at home and abroad, while he maintained his political power. musharraf gave an emotion-charged speech after taking oath when he vowed general elections on january 8 and lifting of emergency on december 16. but the international community did not perhaps fail to notice that underneath his civilian clothes he remained as rhetorical as before, all the time refusing to acknowledge the slogans and clashes on the streets of pakistan. in a brazen show of self-importance, he called his standing down from the army top post and taking oath as the civilian president as a “milestone in pakistan's transition to democracy.” he went on to boast that the january elections would go ahead “come hail or high water.”
the tragedy of 'sidr' and beyond
in the bangla calendar, 'aghrayan' is a month we wait for. it heralds the season of harvesting. optimism and happiness is reflected in the many rituals associated with the festival of 'nabanno'. it is a time of joy not only in the villages but also in the urban areas.
reaching fast relief goods and services to remote areas
we always find that international communities, including bangladeshis living abroad, donate generously whenever a mega-disaster hits bangladesh. according to recent reports, around $550 million have been pledged by donor nations, world bank and asian development bank. however, even after one week since the cyclone sidr hit bangladesh, millions of people in the remote areas had received little or no relief at all. roads and ferry ghats were damaged by the cyclone. the only mode of immediate and fast relief delivery to these remote areas is helicopters. bangladesh armed forces do an excellent job as first responders to this kind of disasters. our soldiers and officers are a dedicated and competent lot, but their mission is often hobbled by lack of sufficient logistical support -- most importantly an adequate number of helicopters for fast delivery of relief goods to the remote and disconnected areas.
we should commemorate the constitution day
yet another november 4, the date to commemorate the adoption of our constitution just went by unnoticed, uncelebrated. however much it cuts across the political divide as a statement of enduring values of the constitution, we patently failed to dedicate this date as constitution day for the last thirty-six years of our nationhood. it is a pity to find this date disappear from the consciousness and conspicuously missing in the array of our designated national dates. our inadequacy to comprehend the significance of this date in our civil life refrained us from according it a national status like most other nations. (in us constitution day is an official holiday). beyond our commitment to republicanism, the exigency of the constitution day is vividly underlined when viewed against our national track record defiled by military take-overs and one-party rule, ironically imposed by an elected government, a classic example in the realm of our constitutional history. view the page sports

bangladesh's export-import policies and the way forward

(not) meeting my londoni mama

in quest of immortality, peace and happiness
daoism (or taoism) is one of the most ancient philosophical and religious doctrines in china. institutionally, it is about two thousand years old, but out of institution, it is as old as egyptian and mesopotamian traditions and older than the greek and roman ones. daoism developed through a natural course of events from the practices of life of the common people. so it is naturalistic and simplistic in its outlook, which reflects the profound human aspirations in a balance of pragmatism and spiritualism. daoism has incorporated all the essential elements of traditional cultures of china deep-rooted in its soil patterning localised socio-psychological traits. that is why it is said, “if you want to know china you must know daoism.”
