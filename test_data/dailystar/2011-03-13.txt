slum dog millionaires
it was more than what could be asked from a cricket match. or at least from a cricket match in which bangladesh is a major protagonist. it was a tale of twists and turns and then more twists. it was a roller coaster ride of a flood of emotions that ebbed and flowed with as much of the intensity of the currents of the karnafuly on whose banks this cricketing drama was enacted. it was in the end a tale, told not by idiots but by commentators and experts made to look like ones, full of sound and fury and signifying some of the most obvious.
