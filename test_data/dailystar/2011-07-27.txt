sonia gandhi’s visit to dhaka
prime minister sheikh hasina and india’s ruling congress leader sonia gandhi believe --- and we agree with them --- that concerted efforts need to be expended in tackling terrorism and militancy in the interest of a stable and secure future for south asia. such unanimity of views must clearly be supported by concrete measures. for bangladesh and india, indeed for all other member-nations of saarc, it is of utmost importance that a well-defined strategy be shaped to combat the forces which have of late sought to destabilise the course of life in the region. there are two underlying principles that can underpin such a strategy. firstly, all nations but especially india and bangladesh must agree to share intelligence on a regular basis if militancy and terrorism are to be nipped in the bud. secondly, each country must ensure that its territory is not used by militants to plan attacks anywhere in the region or elsewhere. inter-state coordination of intelligence sharing is thus crucial.
