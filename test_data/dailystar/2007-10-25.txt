again the prices of vegetables, oil, rice, potato, onion and eggs have increased just a few days after eid. the wholesalers are making the excuse that the rise in prices is due to short supply of goods. the prices came down when the rab roamed around the markets before eid. but this came to nothing as soon as the rab stopped its drive to prevent shopkeepers from charging too high. the government has to find out the mysterious causes behind this sudden rise in the prices of essential commodities. it was easily prognosticated that the prices would increase once the rab stopped its mission and that's exactly what has happened. there are business people who want to make undue profits.
