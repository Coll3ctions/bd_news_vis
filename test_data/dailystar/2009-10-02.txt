draft union parishad law
the draft local government (union parishad) law finalised by the parliamentary committee on the local government ministry for passing in the next session of the jatiya sangsad demonstrates a tendency to pander to the political and electoral culture of the old. that is because it has done away with the earlier eligibility criteria of rescheduling bank loans, payment of utility arrear bills and providing eight pieces of vital personal information one year before filing nomination papers for the union parishad elections. for, by allowing the candidates to reschedule their loan and pay up arrear bills just one day before the filing of nomination papers is tantamount to issuing a 'no objection to loan default' as far as eligibility for participation in the local elections is concerned thereby virtually denying the public the right to choose their representatives from amongst candidates with clean records. what is important to note is that there will be no mechanism now to check the veracity of any statement submitted by the candidate within a span of twenty-four hours.
nature's fury in frightful forms
nature has been doing its worst in large parts of asia. in these past couple of days, a tsunami has hit samoa, a typhoon has devastated lives in vietnam, laos and cambodia, destruction has been wreaked in the philippines and an earthquake has laid lives low in indonesia. natural disasters are of course to be expected and have been happening over the centuries. but for such disasters to strike in such quick frequency and in such damaging manner certainly causes alarm among various parts of the globe. here in bangladesh, instances of low intensity earthquakes have been recorded over the past few months, something that has people worried about the consequences should a major earthquake occur. there are already the dire predictions of the devastation which could descend in such a situation. as many as seventy per cent of building structures in the capital are feared to be vulnerable. one can only shudder at the possibility.

mission complete?
"the taste of victory is the burden of responsibility," said dalia grybanskaite, the first woman elected as president of lithuania. if anyone thinks that the awami league's mission is complete, having won the election so overwhelmingly, he/she must be living in fool's paradise. make no mistake; the people of bangladesh may appear politically polarised, but they are always united in their power to choose who governs them. view the page sports

price spiral
prices are going up and up exceeding the limit of tolerance and patience with no relief in sight. it has proved wrong the age-old maxim - "all things that go up must come down." it seems that price escalation has reached levels beyond the mortal's control, and only allah knows when it will come down! market mechanism misunderstood and unknowingly mismanaged by drives and dictate has set the chain reaction and price overheat which is now beyond the control of the administration.

there have been a lot of controversies on crossfire issue in my native land, bangladesh. the civilized nations, especially the west, are against it, calling it violation of human rights. of course it is a violation of human rights but in bangladesh context it became necessary and is still necessary to contain crime. killing a man by law enforcement agencies in the guise of crossfire is an extra-judicial killing and surely the civilized nations have the right to criticise us. but when the action is taken for security and safety of other innocent lives in desperation, it may be condoned.

significance of zakat
the quranic word 'zakat' not only has the meaning of charity, alms, official tax and voluntary contribution, but it also has a strong spiritual motive. the way the holy quran induces the well-off to give zakat is courteous yet firm. if they give the poor their due, allah will pay back them many times over with blessings in this world and the next (57:11, and 73:23). that is why, alms giving is often represented in the holy quran as a transaction between man, who is temporary, and allah, who is permanent, the generous -- who has created everything. the holy quran says, "who is it that will lend allah a goodly loan so he multiplies it to him manifold? and allah withholds and extends and to him you shall return."

to the prime minister…
i write this letter to inform you of a news report that caught everyone's attention a couple of weeks ago on television. the news was read so fast that we missed out on the names that were mentioned and i apologize for not being able to provide that information but i assure you any news sources will be able to confirm the incident. the story is about a very young schoolgirl who was raped and murdered in her own home and left it to her parents to find her upon their return from work. the news was a follow-up of the incident. i am not writing to talk about the crime that took place. it is unimaginable and a disgrace to the human race. i am writing about the follow-up which mentioned that until that day the girl's parents have not seen the light of justice. that is because they are threatened by some men close to the miscreants, and the police officer in charge of the investigation was recently transferred without being able to re-assign the particular 'file' to the new investigation officer.

jai bangla: visual memoirs of a freedom fighter
shahabuddin ahmed is one of the most recognised painters of our country who carved a niche in the '70s -- a time when a few artists started to experiment, and some painters were busy establishing a personal hallmark. shahabuddin profoundly established himself as an ardent and devoted painter over the decades. his signature traits are vibrant figures and their poignant movements. the movements are quite dissimilar from those of his contemporaries. each movement makes what amounts to a distinct look and language. the language is closely connected to the time of the country's turbulent birth and its significant aspects. his paintings encapsulate ecstasy, affections and torment. he wants to visually document a certain time, moments, and he has a great tendency to mingle an era with others.
