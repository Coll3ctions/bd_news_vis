wall at wagha
comparisons are odious. still when europe celebrated early this week the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall, i thought of the border at wagha, drawn more than 62 years ago. it has no wall. yet it is difficult to scale it because its brick and mortar is that of distrust and bias. the berlin wall was built to separate the two germanys. it was a forced division. in the case of india and pakistan, the partition came about after a willing compromise. still the fact remains that the wall stands between the two countries to remind people how they have wasted some six decades in hating each other and in letting the opportunity for development together go by. view the page sports

the malady of operating beyond law
the daily star editorial of november 10 takes a very critical view of the pernicious modus operandi of a category of law enforcement officials that are reportedly operating beyond the law. it expresses justified concern at reports of "crossfire," "encounter" and "gunfights" that appear to be the preferred means for combating crimes. the premonition is that we are observing an increasing lack of faith in the legal system.

the struggle for mother teresa
a recent edition of time magazine had a short featured article under postcard: kolkata, written by nilanjana bhowmick. the bi-line says "the fight for mother teresa's remains." mother teresa is synonymous to india or in the context of the slums of calcutta. on the eve of her upcoming centenary of birth in august 2010, albania has demanded that her body be exhumed and flown back to albania to be buried next to her mother and sister at the albanian capital, tirana. albanian prime minister sali berisha made this demand to the government of india. it is predicted that albania will most probably campaign with more intensity to claim her remains before her upcoming birthday. since this official request was made, the entire nation of india is appalled. there have been protests and the nuns of mother teresa's order are wondering why albania would raise the issue since mother teresa had little connection with the country, where she spent her adolescent years only. fearing that macedonia may also make such an unreasonable request, west bengal's million member state forum has called for a mass protest, according to the magazine. the indian foreign office has issued a statement saying, "mother teresa was an indian citizen and she is resting in her own country, her own land." her own missionaries of charity order has described such a request as absurd.

bangladesh sea boundary examined through unclos iii
the present day law of the sea is the outcome of united nations conference on the law of the sea of 1958 (unclos i), unclos ii of 1960 and unclos iii of 1982. bangladesh has its territorial waters & maritime zones act of 1974. it has ratified the unclos 1982 on 27 july 2001, having time for claims to un commission to the limits of continental shelf (unclcs) by july 27, 2011. according to the unclos iii of 1982 articles 3 and 15, every state has the right to establish the breadth of its territorial sea up to a limit not exceeding 12 nautical miles, measured from baselines determined in accordance with this convention. the baseline is the line of low tide along the seashore of a state. as per article 17, ships of all states, whether coastal or land-locked, enjoy the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea. article 33 gives authority of a state on certain other matters to further 12 nautical miles called the contiguous zone.
civil society and bangladesh's foreign policy objectives
the civil society in bangladesh plays a significant role in articulating people's interests in special areas to the government. in recent times, the civil society has built up consciousness among the people on major national issues such as corruption, climate degradation, and land grabbing by influential people in the society that have left bangladesh's rivers, canals, and wetlands at their mercy.
an issue in civil-military relations
recently, the army chief is reported to have said that the "us has not allowed a second 9/11 to happen. indonesia has not allowed a second bali bombing to happen. india has allowed people to get away after the parliament attack, the delhi blasts and finally 26/11. it's time for all of us to say no more." in the light of weightier civil-military issues however, both analogies are inappropriate and not worth pondering. but it might be useful to consider if this is indeed a defining juncture in india's civil-military relations. view the page star books review
the things a diplomat remembers
there are books and there are diplomats' books. all these years we have come across memoirs, some smart but most quite shoddy, from superannuated diplomats around the world. and include in that world the people's republic of bangladesh, where diplomacy has regularly been a shoddy affair in the way its politics has been. but while that is true, equally true is the reality of diplomats from abroad making their way to dhaka, spending a few years and then moving on with their accumulated experience, sometimes wisdom. krishnan srinivisan comes to mind here. remember him?
orphaned child of an irishman
born in 1861, rabindranath tagore was one of the key figures of the bengali renaissance and translating a book of this great man is a feat undoubtedly praiseworthy. half-willing at first, but then seeing radha chakravarty's name i happily decided to go for the review. an english teacher in gargi college, university of delhi, she is known for her translation of several of tagore's works, including boyhood days, chokher bali and farewell song: shesher kobita. gora appeared as a book in the bangla year 1316 (1910). the present translation is based on the rabindra rachanabali, now regarded as the standard edition. this impressive book full of energy, alive and pulsating with ideas, passion and conflicts is popular till today. the present translation attempts to redress some of the lapses and omissions in earlier translations seeking to offer a lucid, readable version of this massive, complex novel to 21st century readers who do not read bangla --- an immense challenge for the translator! henceforth many translations have been published, but it is chakravarty's singular skilful demonstration of parlance which has energised this translation par excellence.
