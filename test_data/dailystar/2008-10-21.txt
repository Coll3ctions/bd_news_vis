change of mind by bnp and jamaat
we welcome the decision by the bangladesh nationalist party and the jamaat-e-islami to bring about the necessary changes in their party constitutions and, by extension, their organisational structures. the move, which the parties made separately, should now facilitate the process of their registration with the election commission. the decision has surely been a matter of relief and has removed the tension which lately had taken hold of the nation owing to the earlier intransigence of the parties regarding the registration issue. even as we applaud this change of mind, we are constrained to point out that the bnp and the jamaat, had they done earlier what they now have done, could have spared the country the uncertainty it had been put through all this while.
uniform diagnostic charges in public hospitals
the government's initiative to introduce uniform charges for all diagnostic and imaging tests in public hospitals is commendable, as it will at least ensure that patients won't have to pay amounts of money arbitrarily fixed by any hospital authority. they will also be in a position to know in advance how much a particular test will cost. but given the heap of anomalies and irregularities that has accumulated over the years in the hospitals, it seems the government will have to go far beyond fixing such charges to ensure service delivery. a piecemeal approach is clearly not enough here.
cat and mouse game
there may be little substance in whatever passes off as politics in this country, but one must agree there is plentiful slapstick comedy in it that keeps entertaining us all the year round. play-acting or playing to the gallery is all that most of our politicians are good at. and for that they want a return of the traditional politics. oh, how they miss those public meetings where they could foul-mouth the opposition! but when it comes to doing something worthwhile for the nation, they are nowhere to be seen.

reforming state-owned banks
i was not at all surprised to see state-owned sonali bank being adjudged as the best banking 'brand' in bangladesh by brand forum. who could win the hearts of millions of bangladeshis as a 'neighbourhood bank' other than a large public sector bank? i have seen my eighty-year-old father, who retired from government service, and seen the trust he deposes on sonali bank, which holds all his pension funds, not his son's very illustrious multinational bank or grandson's very progressive private sector bank. this is all because of the trust and confidence the public sector banks still enjoy from the common people of this country.
