the bnp's ultimatum to government
the chairperson of the bangladesh nationalist party has served notice on the caretaker government that it must meet its four demands within 48 hours if it wants the party to participate in the elections. the notice, which is really an ultimatum, comes as an unfortunate surprise at a time when the country is in the mood for elections and other political parties are busy finalising their preparations for the elections. more importantly, when the government has been taking steps to accommodate the demands and desires of the political parties, especially of bnp, it makes little sense for any party now to issue ultimatum to have their way. the election commission, in order to ensure the participation of all parties, agreed to reschedule the date for submission of nomination papers. it also made changes in the timetable of the upazilla polls. the government has also engaged in serious, concerted dialogue with the parties. in other words, to date the government and the ec have been even-handed in the way they have gone about planning the general elections.

election 2008
as far as my memory goes, i was born in bangladesh which is in south east asia. what i understand listening to the elders and reading books is that this part of the world was civilized much before europe and america.
political turmoil
hartal, procession and turbulence are very common things prior to election in our country. i have never seen any election without these 'essentials'. lately, the apprehension of three political leaders has exhibited a sign of imminent political unrest. besides, one of the major political parties has announced its seven point demand, signalling the impending political unrest. we understand that election under the state of emergency is unconstitutional and unlawful, but is creating anarchy and crippling the country by calling hartal and putting it into a deadlock lawful? everybody wants a free and fair election but many of us don't want to make it happen under the state of emergency, why? we know that people do not enjoy fundamental rights, while living under emergency rules. actually, what is our fundamental right-- is it like acting as a suicidal bomber, slaying innocent people and battling each other for grabbing power and freely getting involved in corruption to be rich overnight? have we ever thought when does a country need to go under the state of emergency rules? in fact this govt. was necessary for this country to bring back the lost gloss of everything. albeit the entire country has not yet been free of venality, but its authority has been striving their level best to eliminate the venal groups for the sake of prosperity. already crores of taka illegally gotten by our so-called politicians has been refunded to the govt. exchequer for future development of this crippled country. not only they (politicians) have proved that they will be on the rampage, making a chaotic situation, but also they will be indulging in corruption as soon as the emergency goes.
garments industry's prospects
a great possibility has emerged in exporting garments products of our country. many world famous retailers in this sector are eager to buy such products from our country.
it at ssc level?
we heard that it study would be made compulsory at the ssc level. obviously, it is very good news. but the reality is different. most of the rural secondary schools have no electricity. i visited some rural schools recently. i knew that a school in rural areas in rangpur got three computers, printers, computer tables and accessories and even a teacher trained on computer under this project from notrams some years ago. but i found nothing except three computer tables and the school has no electricity till now!
buying gas, a tricky affair
when our cars were run with octane, we could easily maintain log of how much oil was taken, how many kilometres the cars ran and keep our drivers' 'bad habits' under control (to some extent). with our cars being converted into gas, this has become quite difficult. however, i would like to share my experience which i think may help some of the car owners.
muslims in philippines
a couple of days ago i was reading a news item in your newspaper that around ten muslim rebels were killed in a six-hour fire fight in the southern philippines. they were recognized as the members of moro islamic liberation front (milf). however, there were no casualties on the government side, while 15 other milf rebels were wounded.
melamine tests
the high court's ruling on melamine tests as reported in a local english daily on november11 is a step in the right direction. one however wonders if it really covers all the milk, imported or produced in bangladesh based on imported milk powder.
sick mentality?
i do not think any patient will be kept in hospital in any country of the world month after month, year after year. if there is no hope for the patients, they will be transferred to the rehabilitation centre. if the patient is terminally ill, the life support will be taken out with the permission of the patient's relatives. it is out of the question that a patient will occupy a bed or a cabin in the hospital forever under any circumstances. the politicians can fool the people of bangladesh but not the rest of the world. how dumb our authorities are! i think bangladesh should be given an international award for its dumbness.
good leader
a good leader must have a projected plan, programme and a decision-making body before taking up the highest seat of the republic with the latest equipment and the most competent persons.
agarwalla's comments
instead of taking offence at mr. niraj agarwalla's harsh comments on my letter, i feel i should enlighten him about the reasons behind my scepticism. it is very easy to be passionate and make sweeping remarks when you have no knowledge of how this group of people has suffered in the past and also how recent incidents have been surfacing on and off, giving fleeting glimpses of what easily could have been another bradley effect. echoing my fear was my way of awakening all to what the consequences could be and how the world would look at it, if a man with barack obama's standing is not elected. this would have had a catastrophic effect on the world. we would have remained enslaved forever.

cox's bazar
cox's bazaar has only one unique feature , and that is its length--more than 100km, and that's all. the tourists once going there will never think of going again. the beach has no security. after evening! god help you. no lights, no security personnel, no transport and what else do you expect? can't the authorities make some safety arrangement for the people who go for swimming? it's not that difficult. just put more people to take care of swimmers. the canyons in the shore are not too many. they can be covered by strong poles and even nets with large holes, which will not resist the water flow but stop the people from falling into the trap of those deep holes or canyons.
advertisement ethics
the uk government has recently amended its employment laws to restrain any job vacancy advertisement which restricts applicants within an age bracket. it is inhuman and a national financial loss to restrict a massive experienced wise workforce from offering the nation its expertise by restricting age-limits of the applicants.
back to 1971
everyone knows that the independence of bangladesh in 1971 gained momentum due to the political party " awami league". and its slogan 'joy bangla' worked as a strengthening factor in the battle for our political freedom.
ca's bold decision
the chief adviser has finally spoken and vowed to hold the national election as per schedule he promised to the nation time and again. the nation has felt a sigh of relief hearing this news. this is what the people of all walks of life were waiting for. i believe the people of bangladesh will remember the ctg if this happens and an elected government is in place at the dawn of 2009. bangladesh is not anybody's personal property and an individual however powerful he/she may be cannot manipulate on his or her sweet will and dictate things as he/she wishes. if the people of bangladesh have learnt something from 1/11, they should back the present ctg to bring change in the age-old confrontational politics based on lies, fake hopes and unhealthy rivalry.
