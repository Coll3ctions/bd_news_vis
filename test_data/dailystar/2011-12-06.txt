dr kamal hossain, who played a key role in formulating the modalities of the interim government of 1990, says that the democratic spirit behind the 1990 upheaval against hm ershad has been destroyed by greed for power and money by the country's political parties.

holy ashura
the month of muharram reminds us of the epical saga of sacrifice made by the holy prophet's (peace be upon him) grandson imam hussein (ra) along with his near and dear ones against the vicious machinations of yazid. it was on this day, ashura, falling on the 10th of muharram that he together with his family and companions spearheaded a righteous fight in the battlefield of karbala against yazid, a ruler of sinister intent who till this day represents cruelty, greed and injustice. hussein (ra) thus showed that it is nobler to die courageously in defense of one's faith and conviction than to yield to the nefarious, selfish design of a pretender.

institutions matter because economic growth is dependent on economic institutions, and the latter is in turn shaped by the nature of political power and structure, and ultimately by the prevailing political institutions. an authority on institutions, douglass north, says: "institutions are the rules of the game in a society or, more formally, are the humanly devised constraints that shape human interaction." a cursory review of literature on institutions leads us to the conclusion that differing growth in countries is predominantly due to the nature and quality of institutions in existence.

pulsating dead stars
in 1967, a research student named jocelyn bell of mullard radio astronomy laboratory in cambridge discovered a very mysterious noise coming from the sky. it consisted of very precise, short and rapid pulse of radio waves at regular intervals. she and her team locked down four of such cosmic sources and thought that the extra-terrestrials from a distant alien civilization were sending the earthlings such systematic signals in an attempt to communicate with them. they were so sure of this explanation that they named these strange sources as lgm 1-4, where lgm stood for little green men. but soon it was realized that these signals were actually coming from rotating neutron stars (the collapsed core of a supernovae, which takes place when the outer region of a star gets blown off in a tremendous explosion). and these neutron stars were emitting pulses of radio waves because of a complicated interaction between their magnetic fields and surrounding matter. the researchers later noticed that the signals coincided with the position of a flashing star located at the centre of the crab nebula, the very locale where the remnant of a supernovae that was seen from earth in 1054 ad.
