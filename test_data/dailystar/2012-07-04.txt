minister biggest reason
the prime minister's reluctance to remove the minister in charge is the biggest reason for the government's failure in solving the padma bridge project loan crisis with the world bank.
public interest sacrificed to protect one man
after sifting through the government's letters to the world bank (wb) concerning the padma bridge, made public the other day, we cannot but conclude that it was all done to save one man. the correspondence shows that all these negotiations, trips by our officials to the wb headquarters in washington dc and meetings in dhaka had helped us to cross all hurdles, but ultimately the deal fell through because the government would not agree to let one minister go “on leave”.

new world bank president jim yong kim has said the global lender's decision to cancel the padma bridge loan was appropriate.

profit mongering
the commerce minister deserves our thanks. at least he had the moral courage to admit that the prices of essential have spiraled up ahead of the forthcoming month of ramadan, unlike his predecessor who was all the time convinced that the price was always under control. and there is no doubt, as the minister says, the rise is totally unjustified. well there is the excuse of flood that will come in handy for those dealers who are constantly on the lookout for natural calamities or religious festivals to exploit the public and make a windfall out of those. view the page sports

opting for organic agriculture
a few days ago i saw a programme on star plus tv channel of india, hosted by popular actor aamir khan. khan was urging indian farmers to grow more organic agriculture products avoiding the use of harmful chemical pesticides or fertilizer. farmers on the show ardently said that by using organic fertilizer and pesticides their farming output was not reduced; rather they are getting higher price for their agriculture products. in the show they mentioned that the highest yield of potato and special variety of rice in the world was made in bihar from organic farming. india is also the highest producer of organic cotton. if these statistics is correct then arguments of using chemical fertilizer and pesticides for more production do not hold. our agricultural scientists should encourage organic farming to create mass awareness among the farmers. our economists should tell us how much we can save in terms of health care expenses as many health hazards are caused by chemical fertilizer or pesticides. by that means, the bad practice of using chemical fertilizer and pesticides will be automatically eliminated. may be the organic agriculture products will be a little bit expensive but we will be able to keep ourselves healthy and build a healthy nation in the days ahead.
save grass and grasslands
the other day i used the above noted phrase in one place of my article which commonly means “human life is transitory”. “all flesh is grass” is one of the much quoted phrases used in holy scripture and in english poetry.
will govt fulfil the dream?
i was imagining this scenario: my sons and daughters have stopped going to their private tutors and started to rise early in the morning to say their prayers peacefully without the thought of the tutors chasing them at that pristine time. after the prayer they are reading religious books to recharge themselves morally. then they are reading that day's daily newspaper to keep themselves informed of the happenings from home and abroad. before going to school, they are reading textbooks so that they can properly understand the topics to be taught by the teachers. in the afternoon, they would play with their friends. no more huffing and puffing because they need not go to the private tutors'. besides that, parents would be spared the tension and expenses that private tuition entails.

metro rail for whose benefit?
from the june 25 and 26 issues of the prothom alo, we learnt of two very disturbing pieces of news. the first one was about dap (detailed area plan) of dhaka. my letter was published on july 5, 2010 thanking the prime minister sheikh hasina for backing the recovery of grabbed rivers and lands. at a meeting on june 21, 2010, she assigned seven ministers to implement the plan. but in the two years nothing has been done and the plan is going to be changed for the benefit of the land grabbers.

on june 28, i read the article titled “a bullet-proof arms trade treaty” with lots of interest, in your editorial page. all kind of arms & ammunitions are entering through our neighbouring countries without any control whatsoever. this is the most worrying part.
govt. should accept fact
it is not understandable why the government is picking up a quarrel with world bank. we are a sovereign state. may be, we are a developing country but we are blessed with a nobel laureate, and highly intellectual people who are as brilliant as the westerners are. the finance minister had the experience of working with the international agencies when he was posted in washington dc for several years. he should understand what is right, and what is wrong instead of giving opinions and counter opinions. he is the most senior member in the cabinet, and i am sure his words would certainly be accepted by our prime minister. so, instead of giving opinion and counter opinion on padma bridge; let us for once call a spade a spade and stand on the correct footing. no matter if it belittles our head for the wrongdoings of others, but let us not jeopardize our potential as an intellectually fertile nation.

a reason to remember tajuddin
poverty is always debilitating. and when you add corruption to it, you have the makings of a disaster. and disaster takes an extreme form when foreign governments and donor agencies step in to humiliate you publicly, for reasons that may or may not have to do with you. tajuddin ahmed was one of the very few men in bangladesh's political domain who understood the need for even the poverty-stricken to have a right to self-esteem. the world bank, he reasoned in early 1972, did not need to be here in bangladesh. having fought a war for freedom against overwhelming odds on their own, bangladesh's people were eminently qualified to take the country towards a socialist transformation. in delhi, even as robert mcnamara looked for a chance of a conversation with him, tajuddin kept the world bank president (and architect of the vietnam war) at arm's length.
the dilemma of departure
what is happening to pranab mukherjee is cruel but not unusual. it happens to popes, editors and chief executives as much as to former finance ministers. the vatican does not advertise the dilemma of past pontiffs, since the institution is sacred, and sometimes it takes few centuries before we get to know which borgia had how many children, but the news is bad for editors and others who are less divine. as long as you occupy the chair you get the perquisites of god. the moment you are yanked off, the bile of frustration, revenge and ambition begins to flow through your reputation. there is nothing called an empty chair in real life. and no man is a hero to either his valet or his successor.

gradually, the quality of politics in bangladesh is again plummeting to its nadir despite our politicians' horrendous experience of the state of emergency imposed on january 11, 2007 because of deteriorating political situation that plunged the country into a state of anarchy. it is enigmatic that neither the politician nor the nation has learnt any lesson from what had transpired after imposition of state of emergency.
too much talk, too little thought
