the bnp's alternative budget
former prime minister and bnp chairperson khaleda zia has presented what her party calls an alternative budget to the nation. we welcome the spirit in which she has made the move, given the fact that of late politics in bangladesh has generally been caustic and stridently adversarial. the fact that the bnp has now come forth with suggestions that are positive and constructive will, we believe, serve the larger purpose of giving national politics a healthy aspect. while one may debate the points the bnp has made in its alternative budget, the truth remains that such a step happens to be the first of its kind in the history of bangladesh's parliamentary opposition. that by itself is an indication that the kind of positive politics we have always looked forward to could indeed become a reality.

world cup fever
i couldn't fully agree with zafar sobhan's write-up: “world cup fever, bangladesh-style” published in the daily star on may 28, 2010.
terrorists
it was reported in almost all dailies in dhaka that the leader of banned jmb mulana saidur rahman has been arrested with his 3rd wife and four other accomplices. the ig himself broke the news to the press. it was further reported in the media that this banned terrorist outfit was training suicide squads to manufacture and hurl bombs to stage a big attack in the capital very shortly. the police have also found in their possession huge bomb making materials, jihadi booklets and sketches of grenades and rifles. the police could also gather that this group had regular contact with pakistani terrorist groups and evidences of links of this group with a religious based political party in bangladesh. we were afraid, had this plot not unearthed by our law forcers, there would have been a big attack in dhaka.

university in kishoreganj
kishoreganj is one of the most undeveloped and neglected areas of our country, although it has great contributions in the sectors like agriculture, politics and literature. nobody can deny its great contributions to our economy. the district is surrounded by seven districts and the area has a huge population. in these circumstances, it is necessary to establish a public university in this district town. the government can turn the gurudoyal college into a university. it has an excellent and big campus. the government may also select a new place near the town.

mobile and fatigue
in today's world, many teenagers live in a virtual universe, in which face to face communication rarely occurs, and in which friends are made and kept via social networking websites and via mobile phones. this is definitely not good news on any level - emotional, social or psychological. a very frequent use of mobile phones can cause stress and sleep problems in teens, as well as what is called a 'careless' lifestyle including disrupted sleep, insomnia and frequent energy drink consumption. teenagers normally have to get a minimum of nine hours of sleep per night, something that doesn't occur when mobile phone usage becomes abusive. in fact, frequently speaking on the phone makes adolescents even more susceptible to things such as stress and fatigue.

islam and women
my letter should remove the confusion created by mr. ishfaq's article (05/26/2010). i am among those people who are striving for peace, happiness and security of women. our prophet (pbuh) asked his companions in his farewell sermon to behave kindly and mercifully with women. giving them honour and security is a top priority of islam. after reading his article, i get the impression that he believes that women should not be allowed to wear veil.
eve teasing
not only does eve teasing shatters the victim psychologically leading to mental disorders or depression, this humiliation often compels the girl to even commit suicide. society and the administration also try to cast aspersions on the character of the victim, instead of condemning or nabbing the eve teasers. in this sorry state of affairs, it is hardly surprising that scores of victims do not lodge any complaint.
development and natural gas
a scholarly and rather abstract, short essay on the subject was published on may 29, in a local daily, but it did not suggest any solution. however, an alternative solution does exist. i believe that an ngo has already installed such a plant in a village, as published in a daily, a few days back. the speedy implementation of this alternative solution rather needs to be discussed in parliament; and not our gas shortage today, which is another issue altogether!

your staff correspondent's front-page report of may 29 indicates very clearly that there is a criminal nexus, based on corruption and malpractices between the police and the owners of the transport company! if not so, then as reported why till may 28 police did not contact the owners of the bus to find out all particulars of the driver and helper concerned. view the page international
