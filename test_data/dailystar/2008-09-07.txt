price monitoring by fbcci
the president and other office bearers of the federation of bangladesh chambers of commerce and industry (fbcci) have in the last few days been touring city markets and monitoring prices of essential goods. and what they have to report certainly does not make anyone happy. they have informed us that they have noticed significant differences in the prices of the same goods in retail shops at different city markets. as an instance, prices in shyambazar vary widely from those in karwan bazar. the fbcci leaders, who had earlier taken it upon themselves to help keep prices under control, are now clearly exasperated at the unbridled way in which retailers have been selling goods to already suffering consumers. they have noted that they have no network wide enough to keep markets countrywide under surveillance and therefore little influence over retailers.
a big threat to public health
despicable is the word that can partially define the practice of catching poisonous fish from waste treatment plant lagoons and selling them in the markets for human consumption. and we are appalled to learn that this heinous practice has been going on for years together in the dhaka water supply and sewerage authority (wasa) lagoons in and around pagla, narayanganj, though officially there is a 10-year old ban on fishing in lagoon waters. according to experts, poisonous components in lagoon fish can stay in human body for 8 to10 years, causing kidney and lever diseases including cancer. therefore, authorities should have been doubly concerned at the health risks of the citizens. a back-page news item in this daily on saturday spoke alleged involvement of a section of employees of wasa, local fishermen and on-duty ansars in the scam defying office orders.

americans are not yet ready to choose a woman to be their top boss. yes, they are fond of brother and not sister. failure of mrs. hilary clinton to get the nomination from the democratic party indicates that the people of the usa do not want a woman to be their next president. on the other hand, it is not wrong to say that american women are not competent enough to occupy the top position. though the usa is advocating all over the world women's development, human rights, gender equality, their own women are not given due respect and recognition.
life in bangladesh

ctg and trial of corrupt people
the idea of making/keeping our judiciary non-political is turning into a bit of a joke. the adviser concerned seems to know exactly what the court's decision is going to be regarding various bail appeals before the court declares its decisions.
election and return of goons
the government has been compelled to free the criminals because they are politicians. most of the intellectuals, politicians and others asked for a free and fair election with participation of all the parties, they even demanded release of all criminals (innocent in their view). it is an irony that those criminals are being freed. if the participation of criminals in the general election is essential for democracy-- we simply do not need that democracy and election. the bgma remained silent when the businessman was killed by the goons (or so called "chhatra"). we will soon see lots of new sycophants of tarique for nomination in the coming general election. again they will claim they are people's representatives and hence they are the best. we must not allow general election as a process for empowering the politicians to engage in corruption.
if pakistanis were like them…
'the settlement was a "complete and moral acknowledgement of the damage inflicted on libya by italy during the colonial era", the italian prime minister said. "in this historic document, italy apologises for its killing, destruction and repression against libyans during the colonial rule," col gaddafi said. this is part of the news posted by bbc. can the pakistanis read? if they can they would have understood what it means to be civilised. the news goes on--"it is my duty, as a head of the government, to express to you in the name of the italian people our regret and apologies for the deep wounds that we have caused to you," said berlusconi" if pakistani leaders were enlightened like italian pm berlusconi, then they would have, too, acknowledged morally and physically, the atrocities meted out on us-bengalees-- in 1971.some of their intellectuals have stood in front of their press club with a 'we are sorry' banner. is that enough to heal the wounds and scars ? i lost my elder brother in 1971.each and every member of my family went through a painful psychological trauma from that death. is that banner good enough for me and others like me? i will always curse pakistanis from the depth of my heart. pakistanis still have to learn what is meant by 'dignity, humanity and respect' .
minus two or managed two?
this is the latest topic making the rounds of drawing room gossip! the caretaker government, once so determined on the minus two formula, has now belatedly discovered the "managed two" formula, we are now awaiting the experimental proof of this new formula; the earlier experiment having failed! now that the government has realised the meaning of the popular saying that "it takes two to tango", we can hopefully see the drama (called election or selection ("as you like it"), on the centre stage!
deploying police abroad
we came to know that police officers would be appointed in bangladesh embassies in foreign countries to protect bangladeshi workers from so called middlemen. instantly, it seems to be a good idea, but in the long run, it will not bring any glory for the country. the reasons are given below:
jail killing
killings of the founding father, founding (acting) president, founding prime minister and key members of the first cabinet are the greatest tragedy and shame for any nation.
population boom
the population of the major cities and towns of bangladesh is increasing at an alarming rate. it has been estimated that if the present pace continues, then 80% of the total population will live in the urban areas by 2025.
the unfortunate nation
it looks like bangladesh politics is now going back to square one. the commendable steps that were taken by the ctg are being retracted and negotiated with the criminal politicians who have robbed the country of its potential and development from the very beginning.
decentralisation
when centralisation limits are crossed, the next option is decentralisation. for the benefit of the 150 million people of bangladesh, decentralisation has become essential.
train on the right track?
i tend to agree with the analysis of the current political situation made by mr. husain imam (ds august 28, 2008). he has correctly catalogued the successes and failures of the present caretaker government (ctg) of dr. fakhruddin ahmed. mr. imam is very right when he says, “the bandits, we say godfathers, who were put in jail (more appropriately in quarantine camp) or kept on the run on charges of wanton corruption, violence, loot, extortion and abuse of state power, now seem to be flexing their muscles to stage a comeback with garlands around their necks and making v-sign with their fingers, thanks to the handling, or should we say mishandling, of the cases.” view the page international
