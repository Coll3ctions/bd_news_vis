the grenade hauls
with each passing day information are pouring in of the seizures of grenades and firearms abandoned by extremist groups. since the joint forces have been on pursuit of variously labelled terrorist elements on the basis of information, mainly gathered from arrested suspects, the clandestine operatives are on the run. that explains the discovery of abandoned weapons. there is a growing suspicion, however, that substantial number of bombs or firearms may have been hidden away in various parts of the country. the success of the joint forces gives us hope that the remaining arms caches will be unearthed soon.
kosovo declares itself free
kosovo's declaration of independence has caused quite a few powerful, and widening, ripples in the international community. with serbia, from which state the kosovars have now prised themselves out as a free entity, angrily denouncing the move, it is but natural that kosovo's leaders will feel some heat in the days ahead. the serbian foreign minister's statement that kosovo will never find a place in the united nations, together with russian opposition to the independence move, will certainly not scupper kosovo's status as a free state. but it does point to a situation where the new state will find it hard to find acceptability among a certain section of the global community.
kosovo and the dimensions of freedom
how you take kosovo's declaration of independence is strictly a matter of opinion. even so, there is that primeval stirring in the soul which keeps speaking of the beauty of freedom. we in bangladesh understand, and readily too, what it means to be free, having gone through the collective travails involved in a grim struggle for freedom. or ask the people of east timor . they will tell you of their sufferings, their long tale of woe under indonesian occupation, for years on end, until they came by freedom. and so it is that we are vicariously made aware of the beauty that brings freedom in a package to the people of kosovo.

diesel subsidy for boro growers
the government's decision to give subsidy on diesel for boro growers is a timely one which will encourage the farmers. it is learned that tk.750 crore has been allocated for this purpose. but the question remains, when will the farmers get the subsidy? here the ground reality should be considered. in the northern part of the country transplantation is going on but in the haor areas it has been already done. here the farmers have already used a large quantity of diesel in tilling the land by power tillers. irrigation is now going on in full swing. so farmers have to consume the maximum quantity of diesel now. in many low lying swampy areas paddy will be harvested in april (bengali month of chaitra ).

income tax law
it is learnt from news published in a national daily recently that the administration may propose to increase personal income tax limit to tk 2, 00,000 from the present limit of tk 1, 50,000. it is recognised and accepted in the present-day world that in the eye of law all citizens are equal. but the bangladesh government is not following this principle in case of imposing personal income tax on its employees. the full salary of a government employee is exempted from personal income tax now. this cannot be fair.
missing the truth?
thirty six years since independence the country is still reeling in political uncertainly. from the initial socialist form of economy to mixed economy, from parliamentary to presidential system of government, to military takeover and now the caretaker government, bangladesh has seen it all. the trial and error way of finding the right form of governing a country has become a never-ending fiasco. perhaps we have missed the truth-- that it is not the form of government which builds a nation but the people who run it do. a flight in a rough weather is as good as the skills of the pilot flying the plane. and now a new mathematical formula of a minus two government, that of leaving out the present heads of the two main political parties from contesting in the election.
sk. hasina and the ctg
the caretaker government is unusually rude to awami league chief sheikh hasina for reasons not known to us. this government is the result of hasina's relentless struggle in her bid to foil a staged election by the 4-party alliance government led by the bnp.
eve teasing

why this delay?
the mss final exams, session 2003-04 of sociology department of dhaka university, was held in april 2007 & the dept. is under the supervision of the social science faculty. it was supposed to publish the results of the specified session of the dept. within two or three months, but unfortunately the results have not yet been published.
dhaka university's ranking
it is very doubtful that the non-ranking of dhaka university, and bangladesh universities in general, are without bias or doctoring by the enemies of bangladesh.
agriculture graduates
nowadays many agriculture graduates are either unemployed or under employed due to limited job opportunity. some of them are compelled to change their profession wasting their hard earned technical degree. but opportunity may be created for self employment of the agriculture graduate as krishi daktar (agriculture doctor) if government allows him/her to do practice like a medical doctor after registration.
political crisis
i am a bangladeshi studying engineering in the united states. until now, i have always represented my country with pride, but today i have to lower my head in shame due to the state of our nation. those, whom we had entrusted with keeping the honour of the land of bangla, have done nothing but injustice to those alive (if we can call it being alive in a country where the price of rice equals a day's worth of work for many) and those who have given their lives for our country.
suharto
in my article on suharto published online, i observed:
lack of moral education
the current development of all forms of education system has urged an increase in educational quality which unfortunately is concentrated in the words and pages of the thickest books. instead of focusing on the moral development of a child our system, with all its might, is trying to make them knowledgeable. such education might lay a skin on a spoilt mass of flesh. i have been a teacher since i myself was doing my a-levels from a very reputed english medium school. in the journey of my educational and teaching career i have come across many young students and teachers. lack of communication in the community composed of students and teachers has always seemed vivid to me. in most cases teachers place a veil on the subjects in which the students seem to require more knowledge; such subjects include sexual, religious and ethical issues. discussions about these subjects among the students themselves have led to ill developed and premature knowledge. this in turn has multiple effects on the psychology of a teenager or any youngster. if we focus on the current subjects of interest of these people we might fail to discover anything but a wild craze about expensive cell phones, fancy clothes, drugs and sex; which more specifically can be termed as an abuse of sex. this is mostly because of the intermingling of cultures in the wrong way. this wrong or destructive mix is because of the way in which our young people have been introduced to different dimensions of socio-cultural facts. parents have equally contributed to this demolition of morals by restricting a student's freedom of communication with his/her teacher. view the page international
