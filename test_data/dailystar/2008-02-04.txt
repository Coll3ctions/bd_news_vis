cabinet meet away from dhaka
the council of advisers of the caretaker government meeting in rangpur on saturday, not only the people of the district town but that of the whole north bengal must have felt cared for. with the devolution of powers on to a well- structured local government system yet to be effected, any step to bring the top administration within the close proximity of the people away from the capital is to be welcomed. some of the previous governments had tried it with a lot of fanfare mostly ending up distributing favours to ruling party followers. this government has only a greater reason to be holding cabinet meetings outside the capital because there is no parliament now with the grievances of outlying districts getting known at the centre of power.

the wrong experience
the democratic party's two remaining candidates have become so cordial toward one another that you could easily believe there are few substantive differences between them. at last thursday's debate, barack obama and hillary clinton heartily agreed on most issues and added that they were having a wonderful time chatting with one another. the republican race, by contrast, is bubbling over with tensions and personal animosities. watch any encounter between john mccain and mitt romney and you can almost see the smoke steaming out of each one's ears. view the page sports

price of rice
the business community and the down-to-earth experts (having not so high degrees in economics) warned the present caretaker government time and again about the impending food shortage, possible rise in price in the international market and appealed for quick action. the importers wary of 'wholesale anti-corruption' and anti-hoarding operations were not much eager to import rice in large quantity. the tcb was sidelined and the bdr was entrusted with the job of import of rice and the result was inevitable.
dhaka roads
now that the winter is here, i wonder why the condition of the dhaka roads (not to speak of the rest of the country) is so horrible. there hardly has been any rain during the last few months and yet we have not seen any activities to repair those roads. i am sure that once the rainy season starts, there will be activities for the "poor" roads, which in fact will be in june, when the scope of the present budget will come to an end and, as such, there won't be much scrutiny (at least that is what the people concerned think ). however, in the present context, things are different. i hope no one gives sidr as an excuse which seems to be the norm!
prospect of e-governance
everywhere in the world, especially in asia, africa and south america, governments are using the information and communication technologies (icts) in enhancing sustainable development. bangladesh that lags far behind in this regard needs to put the icts at the heart of all of its advancement programmes and strategies. these technologies can also expedite the country's progress in economic, social and political spheres. the traditional methods of growth and development will be replaced by the latest technology-based ways of development. and one development is e-governance, if we talk about the electronic governance (e-governance) of any country, then at first we must know about the appropriate definition or concept of electronic governance (e-governance). the term e-governance can be defined as efficient and effective use of modern ict technology with a view to establishing good governance. from the management and technological perceptions, the e-governance can also be defined as electronic state management system based on information and communication technologies (ict), including the internet technology, crm sectors, tcp/ip protocol and various kinds of attributes. the ultimate objective of e-governance is to establish good governance. the attributes of good governance can be identified as follows: a. honesty b. efficiency and effectiveness (in terms of time, space and money) c. justice d. reliability e. participatory democracy f. accountability g. accessibility and transparency h. equity i. vision in decision making. many countries of the world are now using the e-governance, and are benefited very much. now bangladesh is going ahead of other developing countries of the world. and i think if the bangladesh government implements the e-governance then it will help the country in real terms.

the subcontinent issue
mr. elahi is ill informed. indian subcontinent has a much hoarier tradition of democracy. alexander got toughest resistance from katha, youdheya and malla republics. these were never headed by a king but were republics and elected representatives to run the government. they never surrendered nor capitulated like porus, who despite all accolades heaped upon him, became a vassal of alexander. vajji sangha of lichhavis, two thousand five hundred years back, on northern bank of the ganges in modern day bihar state of india was one of the most powerful republics of indian subcontinent and was antithesis to the so called grand kingdom of magadh. like all republics, ancient and present, it fell to internal dissensions. democracy is ingrained in the subcontinent in the form of panchayats in all villages, which is a truly direct participatory democratic institution. no king or potentate created it. it came out of the genius of the people of the subcontinent. more importantly, it works. no one in the subcontinent needs proof that democracy is the best system for larger good of the majority. the tragedy is that this remains unfulfilled due to the majority being bewitched by inaction. coming to kleptocracy, in the absence of a widely awakened public kleptocracy cannot be avoided. take the example of india, for the last 17 years it is not ruled by a dynasty, at-least in majority of the states of india. but kleptocracy rules. it is neutral to political shades, sex, religion and leftist or rightists. antidote to kleptocracy is democracy where people have the right to speak and to be judged by an incorruptible judiciary. it is not to be in the subcontinent, because the good people decide to sit at home and kleptocrats rule the roost. as an amusing aside, a mughal emperor took bribe from the east india company to give trading rights in bengal! view the page international
