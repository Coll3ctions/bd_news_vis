hats off to latifur rahman
it is a matter of great joy that one of the leading businessmen of our country has been given the “oslo business for peace award, 2012" (also known as the nobel in business) for contributing to society by doing ethical business. the present business environment has become highly competitive. and the business organisations do not bother about society nowadays. mr. latifur rahman has showed us that even in these days of decaying ethics and morals, a business organisation can be profitably established through honesty and hard work. the societal marketing concept suggests that business must be operated by way of keeping three factors in mind -- profit, customers' needs and of course society. until and unless a company is fully guided by these principles, it would not be able to add value to society and to itself in the long run. hats off to latifur rahman!
independence of judiciary
supreme court bar association president jainul abedin last week claimed that they are not capable of working independently due to the interference of the ruling party. it could be really a disappointing news for the people of bangladesh if it is true. people will lose their trust in law if justice is not ensured. independence of judiciary is a must for ensuring peace and justice in the society. independence of judiciary is also a precondition for the smooth functioning of democracy. this claim may not be true, as the claim was made by a pro-bnp lawmaker. maybe he has declared it in order to discredit the government which is a very common scene in our country. however, on 1st november 2007 the judiciary was separated from the executive so that it could function independently. independence of judiciary means a fair and neutral judicial system which can afford to take its decisions without any interference of the executive branch of the government. anyway, we hope that the statement made by the scba president would prove false and the judicial organ of the state will work independently. we hope justice for all in our country.
ensure minimum wage for tea workers
it is surprising that a tea worker in bangladesh gets tk 45 for a day's work. how can the tea garden owners pay such extremely low wage to their workers in a democratic country? on the other hand, it is not understood how the government of bangladesh could approve this wage? in bangladesh a day labourer gets tk 200 to tk 400 in the agriculture sector along with one meal for one day's work. the wage varies from season to season. but none can imagine a day labourer getting less than tk 200 a day. the tea companies have been making millions of taka profit every year but have been depriving the workers of minimum reasonable wage. most of our industrialists have one thing in common -- they deprive their workers of proper wage. till today they are not ready to recognise the contributions of the labourers at their ventures. we saw that government had to intervene to increase the minimum wage of the garment workers. but even today they are not getting reasonable wage.
israel usa's middle eastern outpost

curse of indian serials
it is a shame that even after 41 years of independence, we do not care about our identity and indulge in watching foreign culture. however, many foreign channels like bbc, cnn and national geographic channel help us enrich our knowledge. but i don't understand how indian serials help us. isn't it a pure waste of time to watch these useless programmes? the time could be utilised with some more constructive works. these serials teach one to be vile and meddlesome about one's private matters. they also portray a negative image of women and vilify them for every disaster. but bangladeshi women seem to enjoy it. such is the unfortunate state of affairs. i ask everybody, especially women who are fond of indian serials, to refrain from watching such programmes.

the current state of bangladesh politics seems like an adaptation of these snatches of a bob dylan song: "sometimes i think this whole world is one big prison yard/some of us are prisoners, some of us are guards." the government has put many opposition leaders and activists in prison, but the question is what's going to happen next? is it going to be a solution unto itself, or is it going to create more problems for us?
