electrification through biogas
the renewable energy policy of bangladesh, published in 2008, states that renewable energy will take a vital role for off grid electrification in the country. the main renewable energy resources in bangladesh are biomass, solar, wind and hydropower. the hydropower potential of bangladesh is low due to the relative flatness of the country. wind power generation in bangladesh has certain limitations due to the lack of reliable wind speed data and the remarkable seasonal variation of wind speed. the country has good prospects of utilizing solar photovoltaic (pv) systems for electricity generation, but the high capital investment cost is a big barrier for adopting such systems. biomass is the major energy source in bangladesh and biomass utilization systems represent a proven environment-friendly option for small- to medium-scale decentralized electricity generation.
impact of forest fragmentation on biodiversity
the biodiversity hotspots of the globe contain a high degree of endemism and are undergoing gradual loss of habitats. maximum portion of these hotspots are located in tropical forests, which are considered as the most endangered. habitat fragmentation is one of the major causes of the biodiversity loss. habitats can either disappear completely or they may become degraded and/or fragmented, both causing serious impact on biodiversity as well as ecosystem processes. loss of natural forests and the fragmentation of remaining areas into progressively smaller patches is a significant global trend. the habitat fragmentation occurs in different ways, like in patches (e.g.), in waves (e.g. by urbanization) or linear (e.g. by construction of roads).
biodiversity disturbed by climate change
every species plays an important role in maintaining an ecological balance among the living systems of the earth. loss of any species threats the survival of several species inclusive of man. man's own survival depends on his willingness and ability to co-operate with the living environment as it provides critical benefits to humans. these benefits encompass ecosystem services, such as air, water, and soil purification, climate regulation, and the generation of moisture and oxygen. human beings turn to biodiversity also for spiritual, psychological and cultural benefits. biodiversity is aesthetically pleasing and provides opportunities for recreational activities. view the page literature
living with kolkata little magazines
there is little question that bangladesh has been producing a good number of little magazines for the last few years. many of them are up to the mark, but people inclined to reading journals from kolkata cannot really detach themselves from those. the dhaka literati who once had few bookshops, like marieta at dhaka stadium market and nothing like the present aziz market for foreign books and periodicals can surely recollect the many issues of bijnapan parba edited by rabia ghosh. numerous novel thoughts on literature enriched the issues. shibnarayan roy, sumantra chattopadhyaya and subimal mishra were among the regular contributors to the magazine.
a daughter remembers
the leaves have started falling here in london and dawn has a different hue these days. i have always been attached to dawn since my childhood because it has had a special meaning for me. i am the youngest of ten children and as a child i always remember being an early riser in kolkata. i can recall as early as when i was three, when i would awake at dawn and stand beside the red and green wrought iron railings of the long verandah overlooking the quiet road that ran by the house where i grew up. i would watch the kolkata corporation people wash the roads. i would then skip inside to see my father, syed badrudduja, rosary in hand, sitting in his study and praying, a little tray in front of him. the tray contained his morning tea. soon a maid would appear and pester me to drink a cup of milk sweetened with ovaltine. i would resist and then my father would intervene and get me halwa puree form the halwaais nearby.
why write?
the question why write? is one that writers hear often, sometimes asked in jest and at times with serious intent. how writers choose to answer it (again, sometimes in jest, and sometimes seriously) can vary, because the question is difficult, frustrating, and perhaps futile. lurking within it is a number of flawed, thin assumptions about the nature of utility and importance. the question's main assumption is that, because “not many people read,” therefore reading, and the work that produces reading (writing), are both, inherently, not “truly important” acts. since few people have the time or luxury to read, writing cannot, then, be very important. indeed, “no one will read this” is the deadliest phrase the struggling writer whispers to himself in self-defeat.

7th november 1975: conflict between 'isms'

problematizing conrad's vision and beliefs
there is much to commend in agnes s. k. yeow's recent book, conrad's eastern vision: a vain and floating appearance. it is thoroughly researched, lucidly written and completely focused on its subject: the stories and novel joseph conrad wrote where the malay archipelago is the setting. making good use of recent conrad criticism, poststructuralist approaches to texts, and her knowledge of the history and geography of the region, yeow has provided us with fully contextualized, readable, fascinating and nuanced readings of works such as an outcast of the islands, almayer's folly, and of course, lord jim. in the process, she manages to convince us not only of the “romance” that drew him to fictionalize the region he had experienced on his own but of the way he problematized it in his narratives. additionally, she tries to persuade us that “in the trajectory of conrad's aesthetic development, there is clearly a 'malayan' phase” in which he negotiated between art and history.
the humour in a politician
politics without repartee and politicians without wit can often turn out to be an abrasive concoction. and it is especially in these present, some would say mediocre, times that a sense of humour in politicians remains acute by its conspicuous absence. we are rather unfortunate that ours happens to be an age when, for much of the time, we laugh at politicians rather than laugh with them. that is the pity, given that there used to be a time when men like piloo mody, atal behari vajpayee, syed badrudduja, sheikh mujibur rahman, john f. kennedy and ronald reagan injected good doses of humour into their politics and left people feeling pretty light-hearted, even jocular, about conditions that were otherwise quite weighty.
