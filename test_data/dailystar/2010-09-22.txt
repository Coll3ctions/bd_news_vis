declining child mortality is cause for happiness
we are happy that our efforts in reducing child mortality in bangladesh have been duly acknowledged by the united nations. the world body has just presented prime minister sheikh hasina, and through her the people of bangladesh, an award to this effect in new york. this recognition of bangladesh's sincere efforts in trying to reach the millennium development goals set for 2015, while clearly encouraging for us, is also a reminder for us of what we must yet do in order to tackle the remaining seven of the eight mdgs. given that as a nation we are resource-strapped and given too that a certain sluggishness has characterised the developed world where a flow of funds from it to the developing world is concerned, the road ahead will be a difficult, if not an insurmountable one. as the prime minister has pointed out in new york, bangladesh will need $22.1 billion if it has to attain all the mdgs.

priest of violence
a priest of florida, usa, announced his plan to burn copies of the holy qur'an in protest of the 9/11 massacre, after long nine years of the unfortunate incident. it may ignite a new wave of hatred among the believers. if some of the muslims are responsible for attacking the world trade centre, all the muslims cannot be made liable for that. when bush ordered the invasion of iraq or attacks on afghanistan, no muslim ever burnt any copy of the holy bible.

sinister plan
pastor terry jones, of the dove world outreach centre (a non denominational church in florida), announced his plan to mourn the death of september 11 victims through the burning of the holy koran. he claimed that he intends to send a message to the perpetrators of the september 11 incident by doing this and also express his grievances against islam and shariah law. his act however holds all muslims (for whom the koran is sacred) around the world liable for the heinous act of september 11. however, his rejection of islam as a religion has already been made clear while he wrote his controversial book “islam is of the devil” and made it available on the internet for sale at some of his websites. other merchandise with the title of the book is also available. it seems to the ordinary that he has already achieved what he has desired: publicity and profitability of his enterprise. however, what pastor terry jones has failed to realize is that by his deeds he not only expressed his rejection and hatred towards the religion but has also alienated himself from muslim population. in an interview with abc news, president mr. barrack obama has clearly expressed his distaste towards such an act. however, mere distaste towards this clear outrage is not enough to absorb the shockwaves which such an insane act will send through out the globe. in these times when social harmony is being restored.
abuse of power
there are some educational institutions in the country where some people have been given the power of running them. regrettably, most of the members of the managing committees seem to be just showing their monetary power, instead of looking after the institutions properly. recently, an ugly incident occurring in an institute disappointed me. one of the committee members behaved very rudely with a female staff presently serving an orphanage.
