review of epr
the government's move to relax some of the major provisions of the emergency power rules (epr) is a welcome step. a committee set up to address the issue has also met recently. although the focus of the government apparently is on the issue of granting bail, particularly in the cases relating to corruption, we are heartened to learn that the said committee will also look at all other aspects of the epr that would permit, according to an advisor, the strengthening of the environment of confidence. and we presume that the confidence he was referring to relates to the political milieu that occurs in the country at the moment.

is wal-mart too liberal?
for investors, most annual meetings are anything but a hot ticket. they're typically held in small auditoriums and feature an agenda that makes c-span look like an action thriller. then there's wal-mart, the arkansas-based retailer whose shareholder meetings are celebrity-packed, high-wattage showcases. last year's gathering featured the comedian sinbad and musical numbers by jennifer lopez and the cast of "high school musical." but amid these surprise performances, the most unexpected moment came when shareholder activists were each given three minutes at the podium. most offered run-of-the-mill liberal criticisms that hit every large company: a roman catholic nun urged wal-mart to support universal health insurance; several speakers suggested the company rein in executives' huge paychecks. but from the other end of the spectrum came peter flaherty, lambasting wal-mart for being too nice to unions, too concerned about the environment and too accommodating to gays and lesbians. "people shop at wal-mart because of low prices, not because the company is politically correct," flaherty shouted at the crowd.

accident and vandalism
some accidents are unavoidable and some are due to human errors. in bangladesh, road accidents are very rampant. the accidents do not always occur due to the fault of drivers. sometimes the victims are also responsible for accidents due to careless crossing, walking or treading on the roads. in the developed world the incidents are spot examined by the traffic control officials and insurance men. nearby people do not rush in like bees and attack the driver! the traffic managers take charge of the situation and the question of violence or vandalism doesn't arise.
future of bangladesh
we have learnt to live with the harsh realities of the day-to-day struggles.
saline water intrusion
salt water intrusion into fresh groundwater formations generally results inadvertently from activities of man. most large sources of fresh groundwater are in close proximity to the sea, to natural bodies of saline groundwater, or to salts from effluent wastes released by human activities. the occurrence of saline water intrusion is extensive and represents a special category of groundwater pollution. water in the aquifer has a high concentration of salt, which currently makes it unstable for irrigation.
hillary clinton
it is really unfortunate as well as shocking to note that the united states will need some more decades to have the first woman president. democratic candidate for the presidential nomination senator hillary clinton could not collect the expected number of votes in the primaries.
metro rail
the chief adviser has once again addressed the issue of mass transport system to mitigate traffic congestion of the capital. earlier in january 2008 he declared in his speech to the nation that metro rail would be introduced after the approval of the project by the ccea.
arrests, yes or no?
the two contradictory front page reports on june 4 make a mockery of the reported mass arrests published by you earlier! while the ig of police calls it a routine measure (daily, weekly or monthly routine?), and also adds that "there is no deterioration in law and order", contradicting the adviser of the ctg makes the whole matter murkier and murkier!
oil price hike
oil price hike round the world is looming large threatening industrial growth and economic development, especially in the developing countries. last week international market experienced a surge in oil price leading up to 135$ per barrel which is nearly 90% increase compared with the prices in july last year when it was 72$ per barrel.
suvs
while driving around in dhaka, the sight of government, ngo, and international organisation suvs (sports utility vehicle) are quite common. given that bangladesh has to purchase oil with hard earned cash and scarce foreign exchange, i do not see why public money should be spent on vehicles that cost about 5 times more than a comparable sedan, has fuel efficiency which is 4 times less, has significantly high maintenance costs, and requires greater space for mobility on our limited roads. this rule should apply to all public offices and projects, including grants and loan funded projects financed by foreign agencies and governments.
female teachers
women are deprived in our country not only in family but also in other spheres of life. if you look at the public universities, the number of female teachers is very much inadequate. although every university has more than 30% female students and their performance is also good, the number of female teachers recruited in public universities is quite insignificant. for example in dhaka university, out of 1705 teachers, there are 307 female teachers. the situation is more or less the same in other public universities. so, i would like to request all vice chancellors and policy makers to recruit more female teachers in public universities.
mass arrests
twelve thousand arrested in four days! people being driven like cattle--the sight pinpoints the highhanded ways of the law enforcers. since our prisons are already bursting at the seams, the arrival of the newcomers will certainly aggravate the situation. it is also common knowledge that our prisons fail to act as correction centres. many people --especially the destitute ones --are apprehended on suspicion. poor people who land in these prisons come in contact with hardened criminals--and this leads to their initiation into the world of crime.
learning english
here and there, everywhere we see lots of coaching centres and teaching homes. knowing english is a matter of pride today. that's why the profitable business is to establish an english coaching centre. we must acquire the basic knowledge of it. but the ultimate result is totally different. unexpectedly, in the on-going hsc exams, a record number of examinees didn't appear in english 1st paper. why this fear?
top two
i read your article, "medical board examines health of khaleda" with interest. i seriously hope that the government is not trying to find excuses to remove sheikh hasina and khaleda zia from politics by sending them abroad. this would undermine everything the caretaker government has done so far.
export prices
a report was published in a local english daily on june 8, focussing on problems faced by our exporters due to declining prices overseas. it is an oft-repeated scenario in our export trade. meanwhile, prices of whatever we import go on rising steadily! for example, in the last six months, oil prices have nearly tripled, but has oil consumption increased in the same ratio over the last six months?
coaching centres
coaching centres are mushrooming in dhaka as the education sector is becoming a big business nowadays. for a reputed school, many coaching centres are established. in siddheswari road alone, there are no fewer than fifty coaching centres. it seems that students need not go to school or need not study at home, rather they just need to go to coaching centres. as a result, they cannot learn many basic things.
bus route needed
from ward 27 of dhaka city corporation, no buses ply to other parts in the city. local people of bashabo, goran , madartek, nandipara etc have been facing communication problems. it is not possible to rent taxi or cng autorickshaws regularly as their fares are too high.
“missing” stipend money
your leading article on june 4 informed your readers of the tk 346 crore of missing stipend money from government schools in rangpur that have managed to 'overlook' 13 lakh 'pupils'. the extent of the fraud is shocking but not the existence of it, as some of us know that, in some government schools throughout the country, little interest is taken in the children whose names appear on the school list.
leaders and people
it is only the power hungry, the so called political leaders of the two parties, and not the vast majority of the 150 million, who are busy shouting for the unconditional release of their two leaders.
paradigm of underdevelopment
the paradigm of underdevelopment, a notion thought up by beatirz merino, former prime minister of peru, foretells failure of a constructive action. the failure becomes forthcoming because the action, though intended to march towards a development, is looked upon as “a zero sum game in which whoever wins does so at the expense of another.” view the page international
