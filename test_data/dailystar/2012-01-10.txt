when bangabandhu came home . . .
in these forty years which have gone by, i have remembered where i was, where millions of others were, on the day bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman came home to the country he had led to freedom. january 10, besides being a significant point of light in bangladesh's national history, has been for me a tale of my journey into the making of history, into witnessing history as it happened first hand. i was there at tejgaon airport minutes after daybreak on this day in 1972, in the company of my friend billal. a huge crowd had already gathered there, despite the fact that the father of the nation was not expected to arrive before early afternoon. it was thrilling to hear people greeting each other with a full-throated declamation of joi bangla . liberty was in the air. it would take roundness once bangabandhu stepped on to the soil of this free country.

scientists steal a moment in time
think harry potter movie magic: cornell researchers have demonstrated a "temporal cloak" -- albeit on a very small scale -- in the transport of information by a beam of light.
galilean way of discourse
the life of galileo galilei (1564-1642) has a certain dramatic - one might almost say operatic - character, and this element of theatrical showmanship is evident even in the form of his scientific writings. his most famous works were dialogues, i.e., they are presented as plays, representing discussions between advocates of two opposing points of view. for example, in 1632 he published dialogue on the two chief world systems, in which fictional proponents of the ancient ptolemaic/aristotelian theory and the modern copernican theory present their cases, each trying to win over a third character who represented an unbiased observer. the "modernist" is called salviati, presumably named after filipo salviati, who until his death in 1614 had been a close friend of galileo's in florence. the clear-thinking representative of the educated public is called sagredo, after galileo's former student giovanfrancesco sagredo of venice, who had died in 1620. the pedantic aristotelian of the trio is called simplicio, apparently named after simplicius, a greek philosopher of the 6th century ad known for his commentaries on aristotle.

who is called 'father of history'?
greek thinker herodotus (484 bc-425 bc) is known as father of history. in his nine scrolls known as the histories, herodotus described the conflict between his own people, the greeks, and the persian empire. while telling the story of their own civilization in conflict with another, many people would be inclined to take sides, but herodotus strove to show each side's perspective in the struggle. in this, he was like the great poet homer, but herodotus innovated even further. homer wrote his epic as if narrated by a goddess; herodotus spoke with his own voice, and relayed his own experiences and research.
