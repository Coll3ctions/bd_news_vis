a self-governing acc
the move to transform the anti-corruption commission into a self-governing body is welcome. in the past many months, especially since the imposition of a state of emergency in the country and a consequent reconstitution of the acc, the anti-corruption watchdog has made some impressive strides in handling cases of wrongdoing at various levels of politics and administration. however, the increasingly complex responsibilities it will now be expected to carry out call for special skills and competence in order for it to deliver the goods. we hope that in the days ahead the acc will live up to the expectations reposed in it by the nation.

1971
i was astonished to read the recent reports in the daily star regarding the statements by leaders of the jamaat that there were no anti-liberation collaborators of the pakistan army during the liberation war of 1971. the daily star has rightly pointed out that there is enough written evidence to the contrary.
national id card
‘fees for national id cards set'- this news published in the front page of the daily star on 22nd oct 2007 took me aback. i was rather shocked seeing the government's series of unwise and thoughtless steps regarding national id cards. national id is surely a big buzz word for those involved in this project in our government, but it's part of my profession. it does not make sense to me; we have not even started the groundwork for the national id card and how on earth we can set the price tag to the national id card. excuse my loud and facts-based assumption! it seems the national id card project is going to be another breeding ground for corruption!
cng auto-rickshaw
i was very happy when the government took the decision of running the cng auto-rickshaw by the meter and also that the drivers will go to any destination according to the passengers' needs. and for that you reduced the deposit money of the cng drivers to their owners and increased the fare from tk. 12 to 13.50 for the first 2 kms.
distorted history
i had the opportunity to visit chittagong on a number occasions during the last few months. for that purpose i had to travel through shah amanat international airport. i was shocked to come across distorted history on the mural at the departure lounge. the mural inscribes the distorted message of major zia proclaiming the independence and urging different governments to accord recognition to our newborn country. such was the norm during the jote sarkar. the mural does not mention the actual message that major zia read at the kalurghat radio station on 27th march 1971. in the actual short message delivered, major zia mentioned thrice that he was declaring independence “on behalf of the great leader bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman”. i heard it myself. there is nothing wrong in quoting the correct history. i would like to congratulate the present caretaker govt. for taking the initiative to correct the distorted history and the mess created by the bnp-led government. and also for recognising bangabandhu as the father of the nation. i would, therefore, request the authorities concerned to immediately take necessary steps to remove the distorted history from shah amanat airport and correct the mural inscriptions with the actual message read out by major zia.
road in bad shape
we the people of south bisil located at mirpur-1( west of dar-us-salam road heading towards mirpur-1 bus stand) are suffering a lot for this road. though it was a good road 10 years back, but due to poor maintenance now it's worse than a muddy village road. this road is connected to mirpur shah ali market as well as the mirpur-1 bus stand. but we are unlucky that despite paying tax round the year, we don't find any improvement done by the dcc to this particular road.
no war criminals!
it's not only a matter of shame but a national tragedy that an anti national and reactionary entity like jamaat-e -islami is still allowed to do politics in bangladesh. this is not an anti-democratic stance but a matter of principle. even if we accept the fact that there is nothing final in war and politics, the jamaat's position is unique in bangladesh.
dirty footpaths
i am a resident of kakrail, ramna, dhaka. this place is known for willes little flower school which is situated beside the vip road. every morning thousands of youngsters walk through the footpath holding hands of their parents on their way to the main gate of the school. but the footpath is occupied by some people who are homeless and mainly street beggars.

a question
i beg apology at the outset if i hurt anybody's feeling with my funny question. the question is: who will be a successful vice chancellor of a public university- an educationist or a police chief?
hannan's comments
shah abdul hannan is dead wrong and disingenuous when he claims that the war in 1971 was a civil war (ds, 28 october).
partition of india
i agree with shafi ahmed that mountbatten was no solomon. but, then, neither was jinnah. if a central government for a united india couldn't be trusted by jinnah to look after the interests of the muslim minority, how could jinnah expect a single government in kolkata or lahore to be trusted by his political rivals to look after the interests of the hindu and sikh minorities?
civil servants
the worst thing in the life of a common man is a visit to a government office. he is kept waiting for hours, days by members of administration-- from clerks to officers. this is the norm of offices in our impoverished country. although the world is changing, our bureaucracy is static for the last two hundred years. people's expectations have gone high over the years. but high officials have agendas other than moving with public interests.
cultured people
an individual deserves to be called a cultured person when any of the facets of art or culture has imprinted a certain amount of positive change in the life of that person. for being cultured, it is not enough to say that the person is connected to some cultural field. one might be a singer, a poet or doing fine arts. that does not necessarily mean that the person is cultured. the dictionary meaning of the word 'cultured' can be taken as enlightened and/or refined. view the page international

the dilemmas of rural finance
rural finance in developing countries is characterised by what partha dasgupta describes in "an enquiry into well-being and destitution" as an irony and a tragedy. the irony is that credit is readily available for rich people who can save and may not require it, whereas it is beyond the reach of the poor who are in desperate need. the tragedy is that the imperfect markets for credit nurture poverty through a process of ruthless exploitation.
aristocracy versus meritocracy
let us stop looking for what we do not have. let us look at what we do have. we do have a small and promising group of young men and women who are smart, articulate, and impressive. let them take the reins of our businesses. they may not have all the qualifications and experience that one may ideally seek but they will in the long run be better for one's business than the short tenure short horizon expatriate.

identifying potential environmental liability
the prime objective of the environmental site assessment (phase i) is to identify the environmental liability, or potential environmental liability, of the property under assessment. according to the american society for testing & materials (astm), recognition of environmental conditions on the site means identifying any hazardous materials or petroleum products present on a property under conditions that would indicate an existing release, a past release, or the material threat of release of these substances into structures on the property, the ground, ground water, or surface water of the property. the assessment also evaluates environmental liabilities associated with real property acquisition and ownership. information obtained through environmental site assessments can greatly influence the real estate property value.
green forest: esteemed habitat needs protection
forest should be protected not only because it is the home of precious biodiversity but also because forests was and still is habitat for millions of people all over the world. the relationship of man with forest is more than commercial; not only for foods and raw materials for modern commodities or genetic pool for breeding high yielding plants and animals. to kin of homo sapiens forest is the paradise. still people live in forests of malaysia, africa, south america and many other parts of the world, with their lifestyles interwoven with environment. indeed, it is thought that many forest communities in latin america have yet to contact the wider world.
