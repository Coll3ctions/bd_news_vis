royalty, aesthetics and the story of mosques
in his remarkable study, the rise of islam and the bengal frontier (1997), richard m. eaton observes how bengal first achieved cultural autonomy from the delhi sultanate in the fourteenth century. this, he points out, was the period when the “first indigenous reference to “bengal” itself is to be found. eaton notes that “the emergence of the independent ilyas shahi dynasty” at this time “represented the political expression of a long-present cultural autonomy”. after the north indian armies gave up their bid to exercise strict control over the frontier province and a sovereign dynasty emerged decisively, bengal remained relatively undisturbed for a fairly long period. not surprisingly, the now confident rulers of bengal embarked on building mosques and monuments that would attest to their “imperial glory”. this was also when sufi saints began proselytizing in the region vigorously, but in a manner that was rooted in indigenous traditions as well as imported ones. one consequence of the consolidation of the sultanate and the rise of islam was an efflorescence of islamic architecture in eastern bengal.
an interworking of maturity and experience
the book is benazir bhutto's posthumous publication. the manuscript was carried by her when she landed in karachi on 18 october 2007 after a long exile abroad. in her own language, “within hours of my reaching pakistan some of the pages of this book would be symbolically charred by fire and splattered with the blood and flesh of dismembered innocents thrown up by devastating terrorist bombs.” she had to reconstruct those chapters in spite of her heavy schedule. she could not see the final publication but left behind a masterpiece on the most contemporary issues, such as the rise of so-called islamic radicalism and rediscovering the values of tolerance and islam. the book ends with an epilogue from her family.
a quest for technique and form
the book has come out from spain and art aficionados will get a chance to enjoy the renowned artist monirul islam's printmaking from the year 1973 to 2006. the time is a big journey for a printmaker. he has devoted himself to the print media for more than three and a half decades. his major specialty is printmaking and it is this inclination which has helped him to hold his position in the forefront of the spanish art scene. but his profound grasp and expression regarding other mediums is really praiseworthy. he is exceedingly fond of experimenting and trying out new forms and techniques. to search for fresh themes and present them with a novel approach is one of his characteristics.
women, men, fish and bicycles
a woman without a man, says gloria steinem, is like a fish without a bicycle. that sounds rather strange, even bizarre, until you realise the wit in that statement. and wit is something we have been doing without, much to our surprise, for quite a while now. when was the last time you heard someone among the glamorous and the glitzy come up with a wisecrack? there is ronald reagan, with his 'honey, i forgot to duck' comment to his wife moments after the assassination attempt on him in march 1981. there was john f. kennedy, who regaled newsmen on his visit to france in 1961 with the remark, 'gentlemen, i am the man who accompanied jacqueline kennedy to paris.' rack your brains and you just might recover some of the gems of humour you may have lost over the years.
