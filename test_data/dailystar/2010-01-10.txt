expectations from indo-bangla summit
with the visit of bangladesh prime minister to india we are hoping to see a change in bilateral relations between our two countries that were marked by suspicion and acrimony. we hope a new beginning will dawn that will reflect a shared attitude in which each country see to the welfare and good of the other and contribute to their mutual wellbeing. let the layers of mutual suspicion and distrust created over time give way to positive atmospherics for a dramatic healing of sore points, resolution of longstanding irritants.
our cheated workers in libya
it is quite clear that for all the steps taken or reassurances voiced regarding the safety of bangladesh's workers abroad, they still remain prey to the whims of their employers as well as their recruiting agencies. the latest that we have on this front is the disconcerting news from libya that 46 bangladeshi workers there have been going without wages for the past six months. and how life can turn into a nightmare for men with no wages abroad can only be imagined. the harrowing experience of these men has been compounded by the fact that they have now been deprived of the food and water, scanty though they have been, so long provided to them by the firm which employed them. at this point, it is starvation that these workers face. back home in bangladesh, it is their families which struggle with the twin problems of paying the interest taken on the loans (taka two lakh for each worker) needed to send them abroad as well as keeping themselves going in the absence of any remittances from their hapless relatives in libya.
the admirable spirit of facing facts

safe handling of contaminated dredged materials
hundreds of years ago, the banks of the buriganga were a prime location when the mughals made dhaka their capital in 1610. the house-turned-museum of the nawab (ruler) overlooks the river, which is the country's main waterway for trading and ferry travel. it was once the main source of drinking water for dhaka's residents, and an hour downstream from the capital city the river is still crystal clear. but as it flows through the capital, waste from sewers and factories -- especially tanneries -- pour into it. view the page sports
