clamping fees on dmch visitors a bad idea
there is little question that the number of people visiting patients at dhaka medical college hospital every day is rather high and that the hospital authorities have a hard time dealing with them while attending to the sick. but that can hardly be a reason for the authorities to clamp fees on those intending to visit patients, something which seems to have been done. the dmch has apparently made it a rule since the first day of this month that visitors will have to pay three types of fees, depending on which part of the hospital their relatives or friends are being treated in, if they mean to be let into the hospital premises. now, quite a few points come up here. the first is that the dmch offers free medical facilities to patients, which in turn means that the poor and not so well off find it a convenient place for treatment. and the second is that the relatives of those admitted to the hospital are themselves poor and cannot afford to pay the fees the hospital authorities now say they must.

weekly currency roundup
august 2nd-august 6th, 2009
international markets
this week the usd hit a multi-month lows against the euro and the sterling as market players awaited policy decisions by the european central bank and the bank of england. caution ahead of the rate decisions prevented further gains in the currencies, though analysts said sentiment remained buoyant as european shares rose 1.1 percent. both the ecb and the boe are seen leaving interest rates on hold at 1.0 and 0.5 percent respectively, though the market will be looking for whether the central banks have adopted a more optimistic tone on the economy. interest is expected to centre on whether the boe will increase asset purchases under its quantitative easing programme, although analysts see this as less likely after recent better-than-expected uk data. elsewhere, the australian dollar rose and the new zealand dollar fell as better-than-expected australian employment data contrasted with a higher-than-expected jobless rate in new zealand. data showed that 32,200 jobs were created in australia in july, far better than forecasts for a loss of 20,000 jobs, adding to the risk of an early rise in interest rates. view the page metropolitan

mariners sidelined
i refer to captain husain imam's pcp article (31 july), and fully sympathise with him. what he says about professional training is obviously true. the marine academy is an excellent institution and i am proud to have been a lecturer in marine engineering ( 1965-66) there, when it was in its infancy, and trees planted there were only a few feet high. bangladeshi mariners are now a large community at home and abroad as captain imam mentions and have their dedicated website www.bangladeshmariners.com. obviously, the appointment of the present dg of shipping is an individual case on which i cannot comment, however it remains true that by and large young, able and ambitious merchant navy officers earning international salaries on ships or shipping industry abroad are unwilling to join government jobs in bangladesh, because of astronomical drop of remuneration and inherent politics involved with such postings.

youngsters doing well
while most of our politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen are busy in making money by corrupt means and tarnishing our national image, our youngsters are fetching name and fame from all corners of the world for our dear motherland. the youngsters, very young ones, recently won a bronze medal in an international mathematics olympiad. our young mountaineers climbed one of the highest peaks of the himalayas. our under 19 cricketers defeated their english counterparts on the english soil. our national cricket team, for the first time in our cricket history, won a test series and an odi series by defeating the west indies team on their own soil.
irresponsible comments
the politics of our country has always been characterized by confrontations, conflicts and indiscriminate comments hurled on to opponents. the leaders hardly realise the impact of such behaviour on the people and how it impairs the image of the country. recently, the leader of the opposition told that the prime minister prefers to remain as chief minister, rather than prime minister just for the sake of power. such remarks on the part of the top leader of the main opposition party is absolutely shocking, senseless, and unacceptable. this will not only harm the relationship between bangladesh and india, but it will also hurt the sentiments of common people. the party leader should understand that the prime minister is also the representative of the people of bangladesh and this type of abusive comment means showing disrespect to people's verdict.
talk show
different channels are arranging talk shows on various issues, especially relating to politics, country's economy, law and order , corruption and the history of freedom movement etc. it manifests sincere effort of the producers who take such challenging jobs to do good to people.
tipaimukh dam
tipaimukh dam is the most discussed subject of the present time. many are saying that when constructed it would have a harmful effect on bangladesh. some are saying 'boon or bane for bangladesh?' or 'disaster or opportunity for bangladesh?' finishing with a conclusion, giving indication of immense benefit for bangladesh if constructed properly quoting study report of jrc(1972),northeast regional water management plan(nrwmp)(sept-1993) and northeast regional model(nerm)(final report, march-1995) prepared under the flood action plan(fap-6). some say this is a technical matter and needs to be studied by renowned technical experts from home and abroad. some are blaming the opposition party for politicising the matter for mere political gains. in this respect technical information like aerial survey map, hydrological survey, geo-technical data, earthquake indexes of the area etc. are required to be studied by the technical experts to come to a conclusion. technical experts need to study the planning, design and supervise during execution and operation to make sure that things are in line with the agreed matter. above all, experience gathered in the case of farakka, a similar project, is of utmost importance which should play a vital role in deciding the construction of tipaimukh dam where politicians can play their due role in decision making.
call centre business
the call centre industry in our country is a new sector which has a bright future. there are many call centres here that have been given license to launch their work by btrc. as a result, huge numbers of jobless people are being involved in call centre. at the very outset it was so easy to get the license from btrc. that's why people got this privilege and took license to run call centres. but the situation is different now. most of the call centres have not started their work. in the name of call centre they are providing training to the people for the job and taking huge amount of money from them. but ultimately they are being cheated.
building panel crack
the six pictures on the dhaka deluge, published on 29 july, by the photo-reporters of a local english daily reflect dhaka city and its miseries due to the recent torrential rains, breaking a 53 year old rainfall record, as reported! five of the photographs represented the usual misery of dhaka inhabitants. however the sixth picture-- the middle one in the bottom row of photographs-- was a critical one! it showed the misery of a building, with cracks in its decorative vertical panels. it is the institute of glass & ceramic. the misery was not due to rains, but caused by human shortcomings!
diplomat's words
we express our extreme outrage at several recent comments made by the indian high commissioner against bangladeshi people in general. we find the comments about water experts, about the visa seekers and about migrant workers highly deplorable and outside of any diplomatic norm.
al council
the recently concluded 20th national council of the ruling awami league has certainly failed to live up to the expectations. in other words, this council has been no different from the previous ones and it seems that holding of the council was more of ending a formality than bringing real "change" in the running of the party. while the newly re-elected party chief is undoubtedly the undisputed leader of the party, it was from her that we had expected the initiative for change to come. as one english daily's editorial put it, "even articulation of the aspiration to be a candidate runs the risk of being construed as challenging the authority of the party president," it was not unexpected that no candidates were available to run for the post of party president or general secretary. the party chief and general secretary have already chosen the 45 members of the central working committee, and the rest of the members are to be chosen by the party president. however, for the sake of intra-party democracy, it would have been better had there been elections to all the posts of the cwc.
