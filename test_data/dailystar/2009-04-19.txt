mayhem at barisal medical college
despite severe warnings from the prime minister, despite all the expressions of outrage about their destructive activities, the unruly elements of the chhatra league go on creating disorder and so causing public worries. this time it is barisal sher-e-bangla medical college which has had to be shut down for an indefinite period because of the violence let loose on its campus by two factions of the bcl. one need hardly describe here the nature and dimensions of the violence for the simple reason that the pattern has been similar to what the cadres of the organisation have been doing elsewhere in the country. these activities by the bcl, centering around tenders and all other things that students are not expected to be involved with, have already led to the closure of a number of educational institutions. the irony is that at a time when its patron organisation, the awami league, is in power, the bcl appears not to be unduly worried about the damage it is doing to a government led by individuals it considers its philosophical and political mentors.
sorry tale of footbridges, underpasses
the photograph of a dilapidated footbridge at shahbagh intersection of the metropolis on the back page of the daily star on saturday says aplenty about the extent of mismanagement of the dhaka city corporation (dcc) when it comes to providing essential public service. we spend huge sums of money to erect these structures but once built, they are left to caprice of the elements and human vagary. they are mostly in derelict conditions with no repair work having been done since their construction. lighting arrangements in the bridges and underpasses are conspicuous by their absence. they become dark tunnels at night, booby-traps laid by snatchers. on top, the steep stairs make climbing and descending veritable ordeals for the users.

let acc survive
we all were shocked at the sudden departure of lt. gen. (retd) hasan mashhud choudhury, the former chairman of the acc. he is a man of moral rectitude and professional commitment. he showed us a ray of hope through his endeavours and patriotism. but in his resignation letter he very categorically mentioned that it was very tough to work in the changed situation under the political government. his abrupt and unfortunate exit connotes that the al led politically elected government has made him resign. i think the political leaders have done it for personal reasons. after the election, the acc is not functioning properly. it has lost the momentum that it had got during the caretaker regime. actually, the political leaders do not want that the acc perpetuates its legal proceedings and the anti-graft drive against the corrupt people. the al has come to power on the promise of rooting out corruption. but it has failed to keep its promise. the government is rehabilitating the corrupt people in society again.
scourge of arsenic
arsenic is a toxic constituent that can contaminate water, land, crops and the overall environment, finally affecting human health and welfare. it occurs in nature in diverse minerals. natural phenomena, collectively with human performance, are accountable for its discharge into the atmosphere, soil and water. individual exposure risks are mainly restrained to regions where pollution of natural possessions such as water, soil, and air is occurring. there are two major ways in which humans are exposed to arsenic. first, directly through arsenic-laden water that people drink; and secondly indirectly, through food crops grown on soils polluted by long-term irrigation with arsenic-rich irrigate. arsenic may also affect animals if they are fed with high-arsenic straw, which can be an additional indirect hazard for humans. the most dangerous aspect for humans is the release of arsenic into underground water from sediments through natural chemical and biochemical processes like the oxidation of arsenic-rich sulphide compounds and the reduction of arsenic containing iron oxides.
global warming
today in the 21st century the biggest threat to the world is global warming, especially for a low lying country like bangladesh. if we ponder deeply over the matter we will realize that this is due to massive cutting down of trees. trees are useful for us and we cannot live without the trees as our life is directly and indirectly dependent on trees. no doubt trees increase the beauty of this earth and another fact is that it purifies carbon dioxide and produces cool oxygen which is a necessity for all living beings to survive.
banking policy
in an instant reaction to the government directive to cap the lending rate at 13%, the bb chief stated the measure would lead to reduction of the deposit rates by the commercial banks, as the public deposit was the “only” source of their funds. i think the remark was unfortunate, incorrect and not in the spirit of the government's honest intention. instead of accepting the challenge gracefully at the government move to augment investment, he preferred to offer his counter strategy to offset the spirit of the move.
foreign currency reserves
it is a good news that our us dollar reserves have reached a new peak of 6.23 billion and the taka is getting stronger. now the bangladesh bank is buying the us dollar from the local market to hold the exchange rate. but, has the government considered that if the taka gets a lot stronger due to the fall of the value of the us dollar in the international market, it will reduce the value of our reserves substantially?

metro rail
over the last couple of years, we have been reading and hearing many interesting news on the planning of establishment of metro rail in dhaka city and the people have been very passionately waiting to commute by the metro rail, which to many of us is a great dream. the metro rail, elevated rail are all excellent ideas and a very ambitious plan but to lessen the heavy traffic rush of the city we need to proceed fast to get rid of traffic mismanagement. it is a huge, large, expensive and highly technical project. however prior to implementation, we need to ensure and assert its durability with efficient management that should be thoroughly reviewed in the best possible ways taking into consideration the impact and implications as well as the hazardous situation the people and the city dwellers would face and suffer for a few years during the early implementation phase.

teaching mathematics
many students are afraid of mathematics. and if it is not so, they at least find no interest in this subject. the main reason behind their fear or disinterest is that they are not taught properly. a general perception among the students about math is that it means memorizing some formulas to solve problems. it's not a fault of the students, rather it is teachers who are responsible for presenting the deduction of the formulas in front of the students. as for geometry, illustrative discussion is a must. but in our context, the teachers very often go through a geometrical problem without elaborating.
bloodbath in sri lanka
now, as the ltte (liberation tigers of tamil eelam) is fighting for a tamil state in the north and eastern part of sri lanka, the country is on the brink of a total disaster. i am wondering about the future of major separatist/ insurgent movements in south asia in the coming years.
some pertinent points
recently, the commissioners of the acc in their statement told the newsmen that they would not be summoned by the cabinet, as the ministers have no legal authority to summon them. as far as i know, all the government affiliated institutions are supposed to follow the government decree from top to bottom for establishment of complete accountability and transparency. the citizens of bangladesh have the right to quiz the government officials regarding their activities and go to court if they are involved in illegal deals.
governance
our tib is doing some good work quietly in the background. the recent findings in brtc and btrc are appalling. add two more entrenched establishments: rajuk and dcc, (not to speak of the energy and power sectors. the activities of the acc became very much visible during the tenure of the caretaker government during the past two years; but the new political regime is bringing about changes in the environment [medical university, to start with...].
english learning centres

utilise fallow land
homestead area means the area surrounding the home. in most cases, we ignore the homestead areas. most of the areas remain uncultivated owing to lack of awareness among the family members. in our country, every homestead has a fallow land, if we bring the fallow land under vegetable and fruit cultivation then we can meet up the nutritional requirement of a family.
