* among young people, the short-term health consequences of smoking include respiratory and non respiratory effects, addiction to nicotine, and the associated risk of other drug use. long-term health consequences of youth smoking are reinforced by the fact that most young people who smoke regularly continue to smoke throughout adulthood. cigarette smokers have a lower level of lung function than those persons who have never smoked. smoking reduces the rate of lung growth.

hazards of working with tobacco
quite apart from the health impacts of smoking or chewing tobacco are the health hazards of working with tobacco. the nicotine inhaled from smoking or absorbed from chewing tobacco is also rapidly absorbed through the skin when harvesting tobacco, leading to a condition called ‘green tobacco sickness’ (gts). gts has been reported to occur in 1-10% of us tobacco workers and younger workers are at higher risk, which means that the prevalence may be even higher in developing economies where children play a substantial role in harvesting and processing tobacco.
why is smoking an issue for non-smokers?
there are some 4000 known chemicals in tobacco smoke; more than 50 of them are known to cause cancer in humans. tobacco smoke in enclosed spaces is breathed in by everyone, exposing smokers and non-smokers alike to its harmful effects.
youth and tobacco
the vast majority of smokers begin using tobacco products well before the age of 18 years. it was predicted that if the pattern seen nowadays continued, a lifetime of tobacco use would result in the deaths of 250 million children and young people alive today, most of them in developing countries. view the page strategic issues

the prime minister's office: a critical reform area
these days we are talking of reforms in governance and institutions of governance and very rightly so. we hear of reform of the public service commission, the election commission, police administration, etc. yet one office at the nerve centre of governance that attained a great deal of notoriety under elected governments and added significantly to the deterioration of governance, the prime minister's office, or the pmo, has so far escaped attention. to bring the point home, this is what happened to the top pmo officials under khaleda zia's premiership. she sent her own secretary to jail. at present her principal secretary is accused for corruption; another secretary is in jail for corruption; one of her political advisers is also in jail while another has been convicted and at present a fugitive from justice.

growth of a nation . . . and the health of a society
nehal karim does a good job of presenting bangladesh's history in a nutshell here. well, it is not exactly a nutshell in that he stays away from the temptation of providing readers with a dry enumeration of events and personalities. on second thought, it is a good deal more, seeing that he offers up a background to the incidents and happenings which were to pave the way to the growth of nationalism in bangladesh. there is an absence of pontification here, which is why the work acquires a charm all its own. in socio-political conditions where the tendency, or call it trend, is toward an esoteric analysis of history, karim avoids the pitfalls of seeing his book turn into just another tome to be displayed on the shelf.
women of magic and men of sweet tooth
while reading blood brothers: a family saga, i felt as if it was a sequel to shahidullah kaiser's sangshaptak: a bengal saga. both the books are marvellous works on the socio-cultural history of muslim bengal, skillfully crafted prose in beautifully blended fact and fiction. book-wise the two are blood brothers!
secret thoughts of a romantic hero revealed
it is not too hard to imagine mr fitzwilliam darcy writing a diary. indeed any austen fan could readily visualise darcy's handsome, and proud, head bent over a table writing away, most likely wearing his skin-tight breeches and the handsomest cravat ever.
truncated bodies and ministering nurses
slow man is the latest novel by nobel laureate (in 2003) and booker prize winner (1999) jm coetzee. after his novel disgrace, which won the booker prize in 1999, he has written three novels: youth, elizabeth costello, and now slow man . south african literature has now come to mean more than cry, the beloved country, and the white south african writers nadine gordimer and athol fuggard . but not everybody realises this truth. i was rather surprised when a senior journalist in dhaka, who is now with an english language daily newspaper, was asking about the background of jm coetzee after he had won the nobel prize as this journalist had not, till then, read any of his novels. coetzee is an exception rather than a typical representative of black south african fiction writing. his fiction does not exploit the readymade plots of racial violence, social apartheid and interracial love affairs doomed from the beginning.
