“i was fascinated by its wonderful, elevated classical style”
william radice is an english poet with nine volumes of poems to his credit. to readers of bengali literature, however, he is best known as a translator of rabindranath tagore. interestingly though, it was madhusudan dutta that he first took a keen interest in, what with the epic poet's masterly as well as creative combination of west and east. ever since he studied the canonical bengali epic as part of his post-graduate studies, he nurtured the hope of translating it so that the whole world could know that what a bengali poet in the nineteenth century had accomplished in the form of an epic is no less creative, temperate and masterly than any other internationally acclaimed epic. gradually he finished his translation, which was published by penguin india in 2010. radice paid a visit to bangladesh in february 2012 to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of tagore. during his visit, he along with a panel of artistes gave a reading of selected extracts from both the epic's original bengali and his translated versions, which altogether assumed the shape of more a performance than a reading. rifat munim spent time talking with radice about different aspects of the epic.

asia's air gets hot
amajor arms race in asia is going on without any furor anywhere. as india test fires an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead keeping a close attention to china's military trend, it makes a major advance in its defense capabilities. pakistan subsequently tested hatf iv (shaheen 1a) ballistic missile with a range of 2,500 to 3,000 kilometers, which would put almost all of india within reach. shortly after that, india launched a rocket and put into orbit a microwave radar imaging satellite (risat-1). the security analysts ask if a new door opens for a new arms race in south asia. the agni-v missile fired by india has a range of 5,000km which would give india the capability to strike most major cities in china, iran and south-east asia. the word agni comes from sanskrit language which means 'fire,' the name given to a series of weapons india developed as part of its highly integrated guided missile upgrading project launched in 1983. v k saraswat, the head of india's defense research and development organisation (drdo) which built the missile said, "i am announcing the successful launch of agni v… making history and making our country proud in the area of missile technology." he also said that india is now a "missile power." the indian security analysts considered it as a big moment for them as they see it as a major step to india's effort to become a regional power that can counter china's influence in south asia.
post arab spring realities
the drama unfolding in arab world resembles a classic tragedy. the fear part is that a bunch of weakened, nearly-failed countries in the middle east and north africa would be a severe strategic threat for the regional and international orders. in most cases when arab spring-inspired demonstrations erupted, the natural inclination of most of the regimes was to repress them with decisive force. but there were restraints. the death toll has consequently remained below the threshold that might necessitate international action, while the atrocities which include torture, mutilations and rape have been conducted in a manner that enables plausible deniability. despite some protestations to the contrary, these atrocities are not incidental or mistakes but are an integral part of the regime's modus operandi. the international community was now better informed of the regime's actions, and it was capable of taking forceful corrective measures. while the diplomatic course has proven futile, moral and political clarity on the part of the transatlantic alliance may require some operational ambiguity.

the workings of a conscientious soul
for those who have remained focused on bangladesh's history, particularly as it shaped up in the years after the partition of india in 1947, justice muhammad ibrahim will always be a point of ready reference. it has been suggested, and not without reason, that a good deal of what came to be known as the six point programme of the awami league in the mid-1960s was essentially what ibrahim had stressed during his time in the political limelight. the judge was by no means a political figure nor did he have any pretensions to being one, but that he was deeply concerned about the future of constitutional politics in pakistan has never been in any doubt. he was law minister in field marshal ayub khan's martial law regime, which in itself could turn into a question of why someone of ibrahim's stature (he had been an academic and had served as vice chancellor of dacca university) should have been part of such an extra-constitutional structure at all. the answer is simple: like so many others at the time, justice ibrahim believed a new, properly democratic era could indeed be inaugurated by ayub khan.
