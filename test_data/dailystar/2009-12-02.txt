stealthy felling of trees in sitakunda
the ferocity with which nature is being destroyed along the coastal areas, not to speak of other parts of the country, is mind-boggling. only a few months ago, a group of influential and powerful elements had as many as 15,000 keora and bain trees cut down in the sitakunda region. they simply walked off with the loot. now comes news of the same region falling under new depredations. on sunday night, about 5,000 trees were felled across a half kilometer area of the forest belt at sonachhari coast. the obviously sinister intentions of those behind the deed can be noticed from the fact that the whole exercise was initiated and completed during the night, the better not to have the authorities know about the act. and by the time the robbery was detected, the damage had been done. although a handful of people linked to the quarters involved in the act were arrested, one can hardly say it helped matters any.
death on the highways
our highways continue to be death traps. the figure of people killed while traveling during the recent eid holiday is fairly representative of what happens on such occasions every year. in fact deaths due to accidents on the highways have been on the rise, disconcertingly so. and it is the passengers and passersby that bear the immediate brunt of these accidents, not to speak of the economy, which, reportedly, suffers to the extent of two percent of the gdp every year.
of songs, of pretence, of snobbery
it feels good to listen to so many young people discussing culture and singing songs on television these days. yes, there are too the ubiquitous competitions, in direct emulation (or imitation?) of everything that happens on all those indian television channels. it is not always a comfortable feeling knowing that what you are seeing on your channels is what you have seen before on all those foreign channels.

saudi flood victims
i am greatly shocked at the loss of lives and destruction of properties caused by the recent devastating rain in jeddah, ksa. while expressing my heartfelt sympathy for our brothers in distress, i pray to almighty allah to grant them the strength and fortitude to stand bravely against the natural calamities.
the new generation
though we work with the younger generation, we have limited scope to be taught about their informal communication patterns. generally, they use formal languages and manners in case of communicating in the university arena. recently, i had an opportunity to be part of a picnic of private university students where the scope of flexible interaction was comparatively high. our young generation obtained the opportunity to present themselves in their own character. i was also interesting to know their taste of 'smart' music, languages, gestures, postures and facial expressions. time and technology have changed them.
ti report and we
transparency international (ti) is an international non-governmental organisation fighting corruption and trying to raise public awareness on the issue. on 17 november, 2009 it published the annual corruption perception index (cpi).
traffic jam
intolerable traffic jam has become a part and parcel of life affecting many other aspects of our lives adversely. it seems that the authorities are at a loss as to what to do. although chittagong is much better than dhaka in this regard, still during rush hours, the jam takes a serious turn. indiscriminate parking of rickshaws and other vehicles, mushroom growth of coaching centres and kindergartens and narrow roads, and construction of many multi storied buildings are contributing to gigantic traffic jam in the city. besides, ever-increasing roadside tea-stalls and hawkers are also a major factor in increasing traffic jam in the city.
ctg. entry points
it is observed that all entry points of chittagong town are always burdened with traffic jam. it gets worse on the eve of weekends, holidays and opening days. recently "colonel hat", the entry point from rest of the country, is experiencing long jam daily. the biggest annoyance at this point is caused by town service buses, human haulers and tempos as they keep waiting on road for passengers blocking 3/4th portion of the road for long, as if they do not care anyone on earth and the long queue behind them due to their blockade does not matter much. the second point is that rickshaws come from the wrong direction to cross the main road. there is a market named "colonel hat" for daily essentials and people ride rickshaws to enter and exit from wrong sides and to cross the road. another reason is using the road as parking slot by three wheeler autos, rickshaws, trucks etc.
citizens' rights
the man who expects comfort in this life must be born deaf, dumb & blind -- turkish proverb. all citizens if born as stated above there would be no need for any civic amenities. but very few are so. the rest of the people can hear, talk & see & hence this write-up. the city life is becoming hazardous. the civic amenities are not adequate and in some cases are conspicuous by absence.
uttara plot
i applied for a five katha plot in the uttara extension project. now i am worried about getting back my deposit money since i did not get the plot. i sent us dollar 2000 with the application and as i am in the us, it's not easy for me to obtain refund application form from dhaka. although rajuk is claiming that the refund application can be downloaded from their website, the truth is you can only download refund application for the purbachal project and rajuk has not posted refund application for uttara project in their website. i am pretty sure they are not even aware of it. i have tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with rajuk officials via email, but has not received any response so far.
neighbours
human beings cannot be judged from the external aspect of geographical territory, colour, language, race, generation and wealth. all these are for the identity of humankind. allah loves those who have in them the good virtues. humankind is like one single family of allah. those who are kind to them, allah is also kind to them. one has to take care of one's immediate neighbours. our dearest prophet muhammad (pbuh) laid particular emphasis on our duties to our neighbours.
smoking
many of us are unaware that tobacco contains an addictive drug, nicotine. thus, tobacco can create addiction, just as drugs and alcohol can. smoking can cause premature death and crippling diseases.
name game
i heartily agree with the letter by nur jahan with the heading “please stop this name game”. it took no time for the government to change the name of jamuna bridge when they came to power, whilst the name of bangladesh- china friendship conference hall had also been changed.
digital parliament
while opening ict fair in dhaka on 17-11-09, the speaker of parliament as chief guest told that within a very short time, members of parliament would receive questions from the general people through e-mail. he further said that he would allow computers inside parliament soon after providing computers among the members. these are necessary steps towards making a digital parliament. we observe that while passing any bill in parliament, the speaker asks parliament members, “jara eai prostaber pokhe assen tara 'ha' balun”. a chorus sound 'ha'comes from the floor. again speaker asks,”jara eai prostaber be-pokhe assen tara 'na' balun”. again in a chorus sound 'na”, louder or feeble comes out from the floor. after hearing the sound the speaker declares three times “ 'ha'/'na'joye jukta hoyeche.” thus the bill is passed. the process does not appear to be in line with the road map of digital bangladesh. can't the process of passing bill in parliament be digitalized? in the electronic display board votes of parliament members can be displayed with the summery result and be recorded and saved. by viewing the electronic display board, visible to the television viewers also, the speaker will declare whether the bill is passed or not. thus, in the road map of digital bangladesh, the digital parliament can well start functioning in advance of time schedule.
vehicle requisition
it seems that people owning motor vehicles have to give some cash in the form of bribe just to avoid the stress and hassle of handing over their vehicles to law enforcement personnel.
cleanliness & hygiene
we will be celebrating our 38th victory day on 16th december, 2009. by any count or yardstick our urbanisation has taken place rapidly, so is the increase of population which simply doubled during the aforesaid period.
justice triumphs
when sheik mujib was killed there was almost none to raise a voice against it as the killing was successful. now in power, his daughter sheikh hasina turned the table on the killers who assassinated the father of the nation and most of his family members in 1975. the injustice that was done 34 years ago is now redressed. the perpetrators are now paid back.
relieved
the nation has finally got relieved from the burden. the verdict in the bangabandhu killing case has finally been delivered. now we expect the earliest execution of the sentences in order to establish the rule of law in true sense and also set an example for the prospective conspirators, so that they do not repeat such gruesome incidents ever again.
justice and truth
i am happy with you if you are happy as a bangladeshi citizen that has justice has been done in bangladesh.
nuclear generator
it is imperative that we need new power generating capacity based on sustainable fuel source and that the proposal to build nuclear power generator/s is under active consideration by the government. france, russia, usa, uk are leaders in this field and i along with many other of your correspondents have previously advocated that this route should be taken for our partial power need also.
great effort
english is considered to be the second language in the world and this language is preferred officially and for higher education. but in our country, most of the students are very weak in english. first of all, our students` reluctance to read and learn english is quite visible. and the teachers are not good either.
