impeachment moves in pakistan
pakistan's president pervez musharraf is certainly feeling the heat. with the partners in the ruling coalition finally agreeing put him through impeachment, pakistan's politics is now in a new critical stage. when a new, elected government took over earlier this year, it was expected that a fresh new dawn had arrived for the country. regrettably, though, the present crisis appears to be belying that hope. however, there can be no denying that much of the responsibility for how conditions have been turning out in the country must be borne by general musharraf himself. his seizure of power in a coup nine years ago was a blow against pakistan's fragile democracy. but what has made matters worse for his country are the steps he has taken in recent times to consolidate his hold on authority. his long reluctance to give up his position as army chief of staff and the brazen manner in which he went about dismissing the chief justice of the supreme court as well as nearly sixty other judges were moves that added to pakistan's political instability.

there is a significant saying in economics that the answer to high prices is high prices. it means, only higher prices could contain demand and augment supply. in consequence, the prices could go down.
identity wars
identity wars are raging both on and just below the surface of india. a few acres of land for pilgrims to amarnath is not the real issue. the hyperventilation of kashmir's valley politicians is even less so. these politicians, whose concern for jammu is, to put it politely, less than emotional, are merely seeking to fertilise the shrunk seeds of a now arid insurrection. what we are seeing is street wars over rights and possession in a multi-ethnic, multi-polar state that has gone flabby with complacency at the top and corruption from top to bottom. competing identities, released from any discipline by a democracy where appeasement has become the key to electoral success, are constantly trying to encroach across political and psychological boundaries.
rising from the ashes
the recently held elections to the posts of mayors and councilors have been peaceful, shorn of the irregularities that have been the hallmark of the many elections held in the past. the interim caretaker administration and the election commission feel that as the elections were held under the state of emergency, the mischief mongers aided by money and muscle could not interfere with the fair and impartial manner of the elections. the political parties and the western powers, however, continue to insist on the withdrawal of the state of emergency for the next polls being held leading to the final transition to participatory democracy. view the page sports

the world's biggest sporting extravaganza, the olympics, have begun in beijing. the participating countries have sent their trained-up teams to the venue with a firm conviction to excel in different disciplines of sports. the big names are: the usa, russia, germany and the host china.
futile foreign aid
at first i would like to oppose the term "foreign aid". i think it's not aid at all, rather a way of oppression. moreover, before giving money (i.e. so-called aid) they impose a lot of conditions which are nothing but a kind of conspiracy against the poor nations. if we observe the condition of the poor countries like african sub-saharan nations as well as south asian nations, we can get a clear picture of the situation.
public universities
there is a stalemate prevailing in public universities. during the bnp-jamaat alliance rule these universities were made subservient to the parties. in almost all the universities, party activists were made vcs. so, there were irregularities and corruption. but no measures have been taken to address those anomalies.

rehab and the govt ordinance
i had bought a small apartment in gulshan and have been residing here for over ten years now. the builders who are very well known were supposed to form an apartment owners' cooperative society after handing over the apartments to the owners of my apartment complex. it is now over ten years that the builders have done nothing about it and have been collecting service charges to maintain our apartment complex. the builder gives a damn to any complaint you make to them. as proof of ownership of my flat the builder has given me a share certificate of the limited company in whose name the apartment complex is registered. the builder is enjoying a hefty income as service charges from the 27 apartments of our complex. the builder has also leased out a part of the roof to a mobile telecom operator. now i feel my ownership of the apartment is at risk and wonder whom should i complain to. i am a retired person and i do not have so much money to go to the court.
corruption
corruption must be criticised vehemently, and there should be no compromise on it. otherwise, we will not be able to wipe out corruption from society.
quota system in civil service

extra judicial killing
the series of extra-judicial killing in bangladesh in recent times by law enforcers has again raised serious concern about the state of human rights. even though the process, which was started by the bnp-jamaat alliance government, was believed to be stalled when the present government took over, the reality however is that the process has not only continued, but has also been intensified in some cases. this is quite disturbing to people who love to see their motherland advancing towards the rule of law. we do not want to see that like its predecessor, the present government also wants to abuse power and show no respect for the rule of law. we do not want to see that the present government is merely a mirror image of its predecessors, like the popular saying “old wine in new bottle”.
introduce subway
dhaka is the most densely populated mega-city in the world, no doubt about that and at present it is one of the dirtiest cities as well. rate of pollution has also got a significant dimension. but no remedial measure has been taken so far.
rickshaw crisis
if you go through the rikabibazar road from subidbazar in sylhet city, certainly you will watch something. about one thousand rickshaws are locked up on the field of sylhet police lines. i noticed it first about four years ago. and the number is increasing gradually. perhaps those are apprehended as illegal rickshaws and the owners can't get them back owing to legal complexities. the parts of those vehicles are getting rusted and losing their worth.
deportation of bangladeshi workers
it's a pity to see that the our countrymen are being deported from not only kuwait but also a few other middle eastern countries and it is not the employers who should be condemned for this. we must remember that in business the customer is always right if we are to sell. it is very much our own men who must be condemned. in a country like ours, we ourselves are the real enemies. for the little extra benefit of ourselves, we sacrifice our national interests. when the neighbouring countries have their minimum wage scale, we could not provide our workers the same. it is only due to the corrupt practices of the agencies involved in the business and it is surprising that our government has never taken steps against these corrupt agencies, neither has it provided any security to the workers.
why don't they feel ashamed?
while reading shahnoor wahid's column today (aug.05), one thing popped up in my mind. that these "vip jail returnees" would never ever feel slightest of shame for the reasons they were sent to jail. i asked myself "why?" why don't they feel ashamed ? are they better humans than we are? have they reached the stage of "nirban" like other mohamanobs? what sort of characteristics make them so shameless? if i were sent to jail( god forbid !) for even an hour, my family would never let me enter my house again. not any one in my neighbourhood would garland me for spending a night in jail. but as shahnoor wahid has pointed out the "amjanata" will stand by the side of the road to garland these thieves. people will dance at their return, even knowing very well that these thieves and crooks have drained out the very lifeblood of the "amjanata". i do not think i would be wrong if i say that the problem lies with us. we should have been throwing stones and showering garbage and old shoes on the "returnees". but what do we do?

history behind south ossetia's push for independence
why has fighting broken out in south ossetia?
the south ossetians and georgians have been sniping at each other, both with words and guns, for several weeks now, and patience on both sides has finally snapped. south ossetia and georgia's other breakaway region, abkhazia, have had de facto independence since the early 1990s, but tbilisi has never recognised the loss of its territory. the dispute between georgia and the two regions was called "the frozen conflict" because the issues remained unresolved but there was no fighting. the ice began to melt, and the heat to rise, earlier this year when the west recognised kosovo, against russia's advice. the south ossetians and abkhazians argued that if kosovo could be independent, then so could they, and renewed their struggle for freedom.
the tussle for south ossetia
south ossetia, about 60 miles (100 km) north of the georgian capital, tbilisi, broke away from georgia in a 1991-92 war that left several thousand people dead. it has close ties with the neighbouring russian region of north ossetia.
