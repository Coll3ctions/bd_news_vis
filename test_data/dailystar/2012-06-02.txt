legalising black money
the debate over allowing or disallowing of whitening of undisclosed sums of money is a strong one. the proposed provision for legalising moneys that is off the books envisages a payment of a flat penalty @10 percent. this facility of making black money white is likely to take effect in the next fiscal despite strong reservations of the various bodies representing the business community. the reasons for such opposition are obvious.
aspirant workers deported from libya
hundreds of bangladeshi workers seeking entry into libya are either being detained on arrival at the airport or sent back. in-between a trickle is being left off the hook. the reason for such actions on the part of the libyan authorities is alleged traveling by workers with fake visa. obviously, so many aspirant workers would not have undertaken the journey on the basis of fraudulent papers either, knowingly or unknowingly. imagine, their plight and hardship in confinement and then to be unceremoniously herded on to the plane back home! view the page sports

getting out of the extra-judicial mode
an amnesty international report says that last year there had been 54 extra-judicial deaths caused by security agencies in bangladesh. such a report shows the country in a very unfavourable light and is a cause of concern for the guardians as well as the general people. the last report, apparently, does not take into account the huge decrease of such deaths over the preceding years.
shrinking global economy and south asia
when the european central bank offered open-ended credit line to the european banks a few months ago, everyone thought that the rescue package from frankfurt would take the continent out of its recessionary inflection. it, however, didn't yield the desired outcome, rather spain faced problems with its economy. to be more precise, the global economy is not recovering from the recessionary pressures. this is causing much panic in the third world because of its trade driven growth and development outcomes, as globalisation has made these economies more dependent on the developed ones, and what happens in the developed world has direct impact on the less developed countries. recovery from the global economic crisis is threatened by the intensifying strains in the euro area and fragility elsewhere in the world.
police, also, are not above the law and accountability
members of law enforcing agencies should certainly abide by discipline, law and professional ethics when they are on duty. ethics and discipline of the law enforcing agencies are more important than their personal conduct. unfortunately, it is true that we have found no sign of accountability and discipline in the government force in some recent events. their behaviour lacks minimum respect towards citizens.

stop tobacco industry interference
despite knowing the harm tobacco causes to human health for decades, the tobacco industry has energetically promoted tobacco sale. dependency on tobacco is engineered, especially in the case of smoking, by carefully-prepared formulations of more than 1,000 chemicals and other ingredients. the tobacco industry markets a product that, unlike other legally sold goods, kills up to half of its regular users when consumed as per the directions of the manufacturer.

oil and gas in islam's faultline
because access to oil and natural gas is a major driving factor for foreign policy, it is necessary to look strategically at groups controlling the future of supplies. understanding the changing power balance between sunnis and shiites, or shias, in the persian gulf and arabian peninsula region also offers insights into the growing unrest there over democratic rights. the religious schism between shiites and sunnis that emerged in the 7th century, now mixed with oil, gas, political power and military muscle, has acquired a new volatility that goes ignored at international peril.
soldiering: where does bangladesh army stand in the 21st century?
the world is changing at a phenomenal speed, so is the change in perception, culture and life expectancy the people. hazy concept of democracy poses threat to the decision making in 'military way'. due to technology diffusion and the ubiquitous media, soldiers in democratic societies are changing their profiles sharply. information domain is now more of perception than of reality. the cumulative effects of such realities vary depending on who are the leaders and what they preach and believe? the philosophical remarks of leo tolstoy who said, 'error is the force that welds men together; truth is communicated to men only by deeds of truth' still holds well. possibly we have missed the massege of enlightenment of immanuel kant where he rendered similar tune of 'knowledge is power'. then, we may have overlooked the necessity of making a harmoneuos and cohesive organization. finally, we may have seriously ignored aristotle's first postulation, 'man is a social animal'. the adjective 'social' is also used often in political discourse. the implied meaning of the above is that people are aware of anything that happens around them. in the small globalized society all are aware of the truth and keeping mum or pretending to do so is simply temporary. however, due to many reasons, the profile of bangladesh army is different and is much better on many counts.
bangladesh-us relations: opportunities and challenges
through the visit of hilary rodham clinton, the us secretary of state and particularly through the signing of 'bangladesh-us partnership dialogue agreement' many argue that it is a new beginning of bangladesh-us relations as there has been no formal framework of relationship previously. well, but it has raised several questions to my mind that, are we going to be benefitted from this agreement? if we are, then what are the opportunities as well as challenges in this regard? why the us, the lone super power, is interested to promote its bilateral relations with bangladesh? is the importance of bangladesh growing in the arena of international politics? let's see the answers of these questions. view the page star books review
taking on a nightmare
at first glance, the title of the book, democracy in bangladesh, might appear to be an oxymoron. that is because what passes for liberal pluralist democracy being practised in bangladesh, and has been for the last twenty-odd years, is a travesty of the spirit and, in instances, of the institutional practice, of the political ideology. zillur r khan and syed saad andaleeb, have, nonetheless, undertaken the onerous task of compiling eight essays and presenting them as suggestions for improving the dismal situation. and the papers have offered copious ideas on a number of issues. many are sound, but the authors have essentially placed the cart before the horse. unless the abysmal political culture prevailing in the country is turned around for the better, and the spirit of liberal pluralist democracy is ingrained in the mindset of the general population, none more crucially than in the political activists, all the holy advice and pronouncements will have little impact on the political system obtaining in the country. prior to the current lot, a good number of writers have given their considered thoughts on the subject, others are continuing to do so. countless scholarly speeches have been, and are being, made, but the caravan of dysfunctional politics keeps rolling on.
thank you for your service, sort of
the familiar narrative of the american military experience traces the long, occasionally glorious, always bloody march from lexington and concord to iraq and afghanistan. those who have borne the battle amends that account by adding two subjects of acute contemporary relevance: how the united states has raised the forces with which it wages war; and how, in the aftermath of battle, it cares for and remembers those who fought.
poetry powered by nostalgia and reverie
'a poet is a man speaking to men', the most quoted and solemn definition of poetry by william wordsworth, was the only line i was recollecting while going through the poems in the latest collection of mujtoba ahmed murshed titled chhayadero jibon achhey . of course, there lie some relevant reasons for recollecting the axiom. firstly, there is murshed's facile diction and, secondly, there is the conversational tone of his poems. as a poet of the 1990s mujtoba murshed has been ably developing a reader-friendly diction for his poetry that is completely his own. he generally says directly what he intends to say. therefore, there are few symbols in his poetry. but it is also true in the case of a poet that he/she can never compose poetry without symbols. consequently a poet subconsciously uses some symbols in which the inner themes are expressed in subtle manner. murshed is also enslaved to his subconscious or unconscious layer of mind. nonetheless he is not much interested in making his poems intensely symbolic.
