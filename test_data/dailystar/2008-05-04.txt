blasts blown out of proportion
the heat was stifling. sweat rolled down in drops and showed through t-shirts. in the deep lawachhara rain forest, the workers in bright red overalls and red helmets were busy securing the explosive line. and then there was nothing else to do but wait. the big yellow remote explosion box with a long antennae lay on the ground, occasionally the wireless fixed to it cackling--the man at the other end of a wave recording van somewhere in a far away tea garden called for patience. somewhere the explosive lines had been disrupted.

redrawing of electoral boundaries
the move by the election commission to redraw the boundaries of 133 electoral constituencies on a district-wise basis has drawn flak from the political parties. indeed, some politicians smell something of the negative and even the conspiratorial in such a move. while the reaction from the parties was only to be expected, we nevertheless feel that the ec has done nothing beyond its remit. in fact, the constitution obliges the ec to go for a delimitation and readjustment of constituencies. more pertinently, it is the demographic realities (the last census was conducted in 2001) that necessitate a redrawing of constituencies. at this newspaper, we believe that constituencies must be so arranged as to provide for an equitable distribution of population and electoral representation within them. there is surely concern when two constituencies, of 100,000 people and 5,00,000 people respectively, are each represented in parliament by a lawmaker. the discrepancy in the numbers becomes glaring. moreover, there is the important question of expenditure ceiling applicable for election campaigns. how could the same limit hold good for constituencies of widely different sizes?
a spurt in crime
a number of murders of macabre proportion have taken place in the metropolitan city and elsewhere in the country compelling us to wonder about the competence of the law enforcing agencies. in the recent months, a lady was murdered in her own flat in dhanmondi while two more met the same fate in a banani flat. we remember, only a couple of days ago, an army personnel was knifed to death by a group of snatchers when he tried to catch one of them. and as recently as on thursday last, a trader was shot dead by local extortionists when he refused to oblige them. the discovery of the dead bodies of two young schoolboys in an abandoned house in the city added yet another gruesome dimension to crime situation in the country. these are examples of some recent crime committed in the city. in the rural areas, a major crime that was reported from bagmara upazila on thursday was the murder of a police constable and infliction of grievous injury on four others by some outlaws. they had raided the police camp and looted their firearms.
worries on women's rights
the pitched battles that some radical islamist groups fought recently with the police for two consecutive days around the baitul mukarram national mosque to protest against certain provisions of giving women equal rights in the national women development policy (nwdp), have engendered a deep sense of concern among the conscious people.
bangladesh in a non-polar world

heat wave
as the summer has set in, we are made to feel the intensity of the heat wave. in other words, daily temperature is shooting up --each new dawn heralds in another hot day. even we can feel the wrath of the sun early in the morning. at midday the heat becomes so unbearable that you need something, say an umbrella, over your head. to make matters worse, the supply of electricity is being disrupted--the ceiling fans are not moving!
depoliticise public universities
in this globalised and competitive economies, a nation will be just withering away without highly skilled manpower and technological edge over others. the public universities need to be overhauled thoroughly to make these institutions effective for generating and enhancing knowledge to create skilled manpower. public universities are on the verge of collapse, to say the least. the last bnp-jamaat government made public universities subservient wholly to their party interest. appointed vcs were from among nasty party cadres having serious corruption scandals (appeared in the national dailies against some of them). these party cadre vcs still persist in some universities. the ministry of education recently advertised for appointing new vcs in 7 public universities where the posts are now lying vacant. why shouldn't the bnp-jamaat cadre vcs be removed from all other public universities for the sake of fairness and to depoliticise all the universities before the proposed general elections on a plain field of politics. why the bnp-jamaat should get an upper hand in the public universities during the elections under a neutral caretaker government? why public universities are by-passed in the reform agenda?
our cricket
it has been a long journey for bangladesh cricket. but it seems our performance is still the same as it was 10 years before. we try to be very confident sometimes and at times we perform very badly at the international level. as it is the prime sport of bangladesh, we can expect at least some fighting performances. we understand all the problems but when we see players not concentrating or playing some risky strokes when the team is in trouble, we feel bad.
commuters' woes
movement of people, especially the middle class, has become very difficult in dhaka metropolis. an affordable transport is required to attend a marriage ceremony or to attend a social gathering with the members of the family. majority city dwellers do not have cars. they have to depend on rented vehicles. taxicabs are not always available.
two questions
on food shortage, i humbly submit two questions--
environment
we should show due sensitivity to the environment. things are going wrong in many areas, but we appear to be unmoved. that's suicidal, to say the least.
gas consumption
mr. mridha's column on the subject published by you on 22 april regrets the lack of response by industrialists on gas consumption reduction. on this subject the letter by titas gas asking industrial users for a six hour stoppage of gas use daily does not sound logical. it can only result in increasing specific gas usage per unit of output!
women's rights
i was impressed and energized by syed badrul ahsan's article entitled “ground realities, bengali women, equal rights and obscurantism” in your paper.
rickshaw free capital
i strongly support the opinion and ideas of mr. mohammed rahat to make dhaka, the capital city, free of rickshaws. the mega city dhaka is the most densely populated city on earth but the minimum urban amenities are not there. mr. rahat has elaborated the issue from all important angles and showed the way out. i would like to reinforce his arguments by adding the following:
well done!
on behalf of the residents of gulshan model town, i offer the heartiest kudos to the law enforcers for removing unauthorised cars from all the roads of gulshan on the first day of april 2008. some business companies park their vehicles in such a haphazard way in and around their billion dollar offices whole day and even at night that we, the tax payer-residents, almost were unable to think or recall that the roads are not owned by these companies engaged in “crass commercialisation” of the “model town.” any complaint, grief, pain or discontent about their illegal and unauthorized parking was never entertained, rather disregarded.
consultation with psc
thanks to the ds for publishing a very important news report concerning the mandatory obligation of the government to consult the psc under article 140(2) of the constitution. it appears that not only the question of separation of the ec secretariat is related to this article of the constitution, but also the question of appointment of the 3 commissioners, and other important appointments made for the service of the republic are included in it. i am not aware whether the appointment of the advisers is covered under this article or their provision of appointment is outside the purview of article 140(2). i understand that the service of the advisers is also for the service of the republic.
ec's job
the whole country is now anxious about the stalemate in the election commission over the bnp's inner conflicts. there are many opinions that we get in the print and news media on how the ec could avoid or overcome the crisis. the success of ec's own roadmap is now subject to the end of bnp's leadership crisis.
tale of a nation
is there any government in this country? everything is crumbling. the prices of essential commodities are increasing day by day, pick-pocketing and mugging have increased at an alarming rate, and the people are fed up with the number of times electricity goes off. can't the government see all this chaos around them? or are they totally ignorant about these facts? the government is showing its inefficiency in every way.
cricketers fail
the debacle in pakistan did not surprise me. it's inevitable. the ability of our batsmen is not unknown to me. the pitches in pakistan are not suitable for the bowlers. batsmen play the pivotal role in these pitches. look at the pakistan batsmen, they showed their sublime form. when they batted it looked like a paradise for them. on the other hand, the same pitch appeared to be a minefield for our batsmen. they fell like nine pins. only shakib & tamim showed some resistance.
poor performance
for god's sake, stop the "pancho pandap" from giving any more trouble to us with their vast textbook knowledge on politics they lack, in my judgment, the most necessary knowledge one acquires through his or her experience i.e. common sense. they have already created many controversies by their known and unknown activities surrounding the national women development policy.
attacking travellers
once again an expatriate traveller has been severely beaten and tortured at zia international airport. but i am surprised by the strange silence of bangladesh media on this issue. the incident happened on april 14. the victim is a well-known humanitarian aid worker from the uk, barrister rizwan hussain. he returned to the uk with a broken arm and leg. as if that wasn't enough, those elements had the audacity to force mr. hussain to sign a declaration admitting that he was illegally trafficking humans. even if we accept that mr. hussain did something wrong, it still doesn't give anyone the right to start beating a traveller right there and then. if someone is guilty then it is the court of law that decides on the punishment.
power shortage
