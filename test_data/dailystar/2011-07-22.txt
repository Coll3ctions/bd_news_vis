clemency for a convict
we are deeply concerned at the grant of presidential pardon to an individual sentenced to death on charges of murder. exercising his authority under article 49 of the constitution, president zillur rahman has granted clemency to a.h.m. biplob, son of laxmipur awami league leader and pourashava chairman abu taher. it is chillingly shocking that the convict, who had been a fugitive from justice for a decade and only surrendered to the law in april this year, is now about to return to normal life thanks to presidential clemency. we feel that the power of pardon given to the president of the republic is a prerogative that should be exercised so judiciously as not to lower the dignity of the office or the reputation of the individual occupying it.

the falling bangladeshi currency

not everyone can be teachers
i am greatly shocked at the appalling incident that happened in the institution where i enjoyed working till my retirement in 2007.
corporal punishment, a shame
it is appalling and disgraceful that children in school still suffer the inhumane horrors of corporal punishment. i carry a physical scar on the back of my left leg as a constant reminder of how brutal and cruel teachers and corporal punishment can be. in those days corporal punishment was accepted as 'normal', something that we all experienced and lived through. my 'crime' was that i had a slightly longer hair than most of the students, not as a protest or fashion but simply because my family could not spend for the barber at that time. no one paid much attention to the horrors of corporal punishment until sir frank peters spoke out in a loud voice, brought the subject with all its ugliness to the surface. but rogue 'teachers' continue this repulsive practice. corporal punishment needs to be recognised for what it is: a scourge on society and a violation of human rights; and it must not be tolerated even in the mildest form. my heart bleeds every time i read a news report about any child being beaten by a teacher.
we want absolute road safety
last year in the month of october, we witnessed the turag tragedy. this year, we have witnessed the mirsarai tragedy that claimed more than forty lives. some of them might have wanted to be doctors, some engineers. now all the brains went down the drain! only almighty knows what we are going to see next! beside most of the roads we find ditches, why? can't these ditches be filled up? if not, why don't we make iron walls beside the roads? moreover, there was no divider on the road where the accident occurred.
save the lake
the pictures show how the banani-karial lake is being unlawfully occupied by slums. these are gradually grabbing the whole lake inch by inch. please report in your newspaper about it to protect the lake. we have been living next to the lake for the last 4 decades and never has the lake been occupied like this before.
wealth statement of ministers
it is a waste of time and effort if wealth statements of ministers are not made public for transparency and accountability. the procedure of submitting such statements to the pm, says nothing about pm's own wealth statement (or for that matter that of the president). do the pm and president remain exempt from such statements? who will guard the guardians? if wealth statements are not made public how would the citizens be assured that the incumbent in high posts are good persons to vote for in subsequent elections. failure of such evaluation is not democracy at all, unless there is some other clear mechanism for assessment of their honesty.
where is the country heading to?
very recently six innocent students were beaten to death in aminbazar area of dhaka in the holy night of shab-e- barat, 44 students died in a horrible road accident in mirsarai, chittagong; a teacher of a renowned school in dhaka raped his student; and a husband pushed his fingers into his wife's eyes, making her completely blind. the list of such incidents will be long. our experience tells us that none of the accused will be punished for their crimes. we know very well that no crime is punished in this country. the law enforcing agencies are being used by the people in power, whoever they are. and the common people are getting no justice. we do not know every day how many girls are being harassed and raped in this country, how many people are dying in road crashes, how many women are beaten, tortured, and burned to death, and how many persons die by mob beating. as the perpetrators get away with impunity, others are encouraged to commit the same crimes again. the aminbazar incident is an indicator how frustrated people are with the law enforcing agencies that they are now taking the law in their own hands. the overall situation of the country is getting from bad to worse. we go to sleep every day fearing what would happen the next day.
three challenges before bnss
it is great news that bangladesh nazrul sangeet sangstha (bnss) was formed through the initiatives of some acclaimed exponents of nazrul sangeet like sudhin das, khaled hossain and khairul anam shakil. as a fan of nazrul sangeet i think that the main challenges before bnss are three: 1) to give attention that nobody can distort nazrul's original compositions and lyrics, 2) to groom the young artistes so that they get exposure and can take the lead and break the old coterie who has monopolized the arena of nazrul sangeet for so long and 3) to resist any attempt to modernize those songs to make them popular which are already popular among the people.
'no' to hartal
our main opposition bnp will probably gain nothing by imposing frequent hartals on the people. actually, the general people of the country abhor hartal as it brings immense sufferings to their daily existence. it causes serious harm to our fragile economy by disrupting the communications and dislocating day-to-day transactions in trade and commerce. a poor country like bangladesh can not, therefore, afford such an anarchic and costly method of demonstrating public protest against political decisions. opposition parties should now seek effective alternatives to hartal for pressurizing the govt. to fulfill their demands.
important remark
paramount leader hussein shahid suhrawardy once remarked that the army and the police are the two arms of the bureaucracy and the political party and alliances should face the bureaucracy with a whip which is the people's mandate. so, the opposition bench in the jatiya sangsad should never remain vacant.
biman in acute crisis
biman, the national carrier of bangladesh is as usually reeling in acute financial crisis. compounded by lack of proper planning, incompetence, mismanagement, rampant corruption in all levels, excessive manpower and a dearth of transparency in all kinds of purchasing, maintenance costs followed by the lack of viable commercial route planning etc. biman initially was salvaged by the government before going to bankruptcy when it was turned to a public company. and a ray of hope was glistening when biman made profit during the first and second year of its becoming a company. we all became happy that finally biman would get rid of the stigma of a loss making concern. but unfortunately, after two years of operation, biman again went back to its same old fold as a loss making company. it seems that biman and loss have become synonymous. a comparison has been highlighted by some leading newspapers which show a colossal difference between debit and credit of biman. we feel that it is about time that government should appoint a qualified foreign audit company who will audit biman thoroughly and impartially and submit the report to the concerned ministry in order to alleviate biman from the brink of disaster.
we want justice
it is shocking that the controversial headmistress of viquarunnisa noon school is back in her old position. what more, police force has been deployed at the school premises to 'pacify' the outraged students. what is happening? no word is left to condemn. if people like porimol joydhor the controversial headmistress are not punished, then those perverts, child abusers, and sex offenders will do this same crime again. incidents like this show clearly how vulnerable women are in our country.
