passage of law on domestic violence
the enactment of the domestic violence (protection and prevention) bill 2010 into law by the jatiyo sangsad is a measure of how seriously the nation takes the issue of violence in the home. for decades altogether, violence in the household, owing fundamentally to the male-dominated social structure in bangladesh, has been a sad feature of life for countless women and children. and yet there have not been any outlets, at least up to this point, for the victims of such violence to take measures to prevent their falling prey to mental and physical torture. the absence of relevant laws to ensure the dignity of women and children within the confines of families was felt acutely. in recent years, however, the rise of social organisations, including a very significant number of women's bodies, and their spirited campaign to ensure safety in the home for women and children has emphasised the point that without women and children feeling secure within their families, it will be difficult for society to reach its cherished goals of advancement.
jatrabari factory fire
tuesday's inferno at a jatrabari chemical factory that claimed seven lives including critical burn injury to four is yet another instance of how insensitive we are as a people towards human life. it appears, the devastating nimtoli blaze and some similar cases of smaller fires that followed were not enough to bring either the authorities concerned, or the operators of these factories dealing with flammable substances to their senses. and it is this inexplicable collective indifference to the gaping problem that has been responsible for the latest lethal fire at jatrabari. view the page sports

approach to development
what should be the right approach to the development projects in the public sector by the succeeding elected regimes, especially in the developing countries? in bangladesh, is the approach in the right direction, and the right attitude? there is a tendency to go for mega projects, and mega publicity. in the ldcs, political governance is conducted on the front stage, not in the background, and it is noisy and loudspeaker based.
the gentleman's game
from its origin cricket has been tagged as the game of the kings. the aristocrats have enjoyed it for centuries. but as time passed it has been adopted by the wider society. the gradual rise in popularity has transformed cricket from a royal pastime to a highly professional sport. what makes cricket such a distinguished sport is its very nature.
chemicals in fruits
some news reports published recently in the leading dailies of our country shows that a very large group of wholesale fruits traders all over the country are using dangerous chemicals to ripen local fruits like -- bananas, mangoes, litchis, guavas, pineapples, oranges, etc. people are buying and eating these fruits daily without being aware of the problems it would cause them. it is feared that a very large number of our population have already been badly affected.
water scarcity in gulshan
wasa had undertaken three months ago a project to set up a deep tube-well at a place on gulshan west lake side following demand of the local residents and gulshan society. the deep tube-well was supposed to be commissioned within, at best, 45 days. former president and local mp h.m. ershad laid the foundation of the project on july 1 in the presence of local residents, and the concerned wasa officials assured that the sufferings of the gulshan people due to shortage of water supply would be over as soon as the deep tube-well was put into commission. the concerned engineers were of the view that the pump could hopefully be able to supply water before ramadan (11 august). that didn't happen even after three months. rather the situation has worsened with time.
human rights violation
your staff correspondent's report published on 3rd october of alleged maltreatment by russian officials of a bangladeshi is a very serious matter. as the concerned officials responsible for the alleged cruelty and torture have been named, it is a very direct accusation, and our authorities cannot ignore the matter. however, one part of the report is not clear. the victim states that he failed to lodge a police complaint in moscow, as the police stations there did not accept it! nothing was said about his effort to contact our embassy in moscow. this is an important part which was not provided in the report.
managing the traffic
i completely agree with mr. nokib-e-kibria (toronto, canada, 29th september) that the traffic condition in our country is deplorable. it takes laborious hours for students just to reach the schools, colleges and universities, and when it comes to facing quizzes and exams, the situation gets worse as no one can make it on time. the office employees who cannot afford any other expensive means of transportation end up going for the cheaper commutation means such as public buses. hour after hour commuters have to stand in a long queue at the bus stand in the anticipation that their desired buses would come to pick them up. but those buses, too, get stuck in the jam en route.
child labour
the working children of bangladesh perform in many different capacities - as domestic workers, garage helpers, and factory workers, porters in railway stations and markets in hazardous conditions. many boys and girls do not have access to education and they are doing low-pay works that further binds them into the cycle of poverty. the picture is especially miserable for children living in urban slums.
good teacher needed
a good teacher should not only have good academic qualifications but also a good teaching style. nowadays, teachers are not sincere, dutiful and punctual. not only that, they don't even have good academic qualification. at the university level, most of the teachers are being appointed on the basis of political consideration. seeing this immoral recruitment process, many of the meritorious students are leaving the country.
road safety
a lot of time has been wasted in planning and arranging funds to develop city roads. strict action should be taken against the drivers who drive recklessly. the best way to stop reckless driving is to set up speed-breakers on all city roads. it will not cost much. and the govt. should also set up rab /police check posts to check suspicious movement of vehicles. the authorities concerned should immediately set up speed-breakers especially at four-way roads. these areas are prone to fatal accidents due to speedy movement of buses. we don't want to lose our lives in road accidents. we want to return home alive, and not as dead bodies.
child parliament session
different forums work in our country on child rights. recently a child parliament session entitled "education and good governance" was arranged by save the children, australia, which brought to light some important issues. child parliamentarians from 64 districts took part in the session. local children came out with various proposals on different issues like facilities at schools, transport problem, private tuition, and so on. education minister nurul islam nahid was present at the session and listened to the children. it is good news for us that our children can raise their voices to establish their own rights.
divulging the truth
sometimes what a news item cannot say, a cartoon can depict it more completely (ds: 22.09.10). we should be thankful to the health adviser for telling the truth, what some other ministers or advisors prefer to hide. so, why do we blame our health adviser? he should be thanked for his honesty instead!
sufferings on the road
the daily star carried a front-page news on 30 sept captioned “reception at airport, sufferings on road.” this is not new in our country. the leaders of the third world countries never learn from history. as soon as they assume power, they forget the past, they forget what happened to their immediate predecessors.
extortion
extortion means compelling someone to pay a particular amount of money, or taking away a particular amount of money forcefully from someone. extortion is a crime and we the city people face this in several forms.

tisha on the hot seat
model and actress nusrat imroz tisha has been a familiar face to the tv viewers for a while, but her biggest claim to fame has been her critically acclaimed and audience-admired performance in mostofa sarwar farooki's film “third person singular number”. the film has been selected as the bangladeshi entry for the 83rd academy awards and will compete in the best foreign language film segment. she recently tied the knot with farooki. tisha became active in dancing, singing and recitation when she was very young, and earned a gold medal in the nationwide talent hunt “notun kuri” for her dancing skills in 1995. since her introduction on tv through the play “shat poure kabbo”, it has been a remarkable ride for the talented tisha. the actress was on the hot seat at ds café last week and responded to fans’ phone calls. highlights from the session:

now you see it, now you don't. one week the government officers in pabna cry in front of reporters. another week the prime minister's adviser denies those men ever shed any tears. so what do we make of those tearful faces we saw in the news? the honourable advisor has a plausible theory to tide us over. those images were cooked up to embarrass the government, he said. in the same breath he also claimed it was the media which played up the whole thing.
