garments export stuttering

post flood action plan: some thoughts in retrospect
ihad previously expressed my experience of facing floods and how best it could be handled. now i will discuss something on the issues when flood waters start receding. hopefully, by the grace of allah, very soon the flood washed land would again rise to normal. people will then start building their homes, and carry out programmes for harvesting their lands. in my experience, handling the post-flood situation is far more difficult than facing the flood when it starts engulfing areas one after another. i have experienced that myself in 1988 -- let the people recapitulate how it was done. i will now discuss how it can be done, not only during flood but also during other natural calamites when they come.
prices, politics and progress
the present perception of the people of bangladesh is that the prices of essentials are going through the roofs. interviews of consumers by private tv channels tend to bear this out. food (especially rice) price is the point to ponder as it has historic relationship with poverty, political stability, and overall economic progress -- a topic we shall take up very shortly. before that, a comparative picture is worth mentioning. in 2000, a wage labourer could buy 6-7 kg of rice with his daily income (say tk.60/day). now, less than half of that can be bought, even though the income has risen over time.

tear gas
it is late december 1968. in karachi. i'm walking home mentally re-winding the sickle scene in the czech movie i've just seen. i'm in class nine, and it's the first 'art' movie i've seen. curious about the east european film festival being held in the city, i'd snagged my father's invitation card. the afternoon light along elphinstone street is clear and bright, like the one that had lit up the stunning swat-like hills and valleys in the movie. i've almost forgotten that karachi is burning with the anti-ayub movement -- demos, protest marches and police action are almost daily events since the student shooting in pindi in november.
this summer in london: damien hirst, wh auden and tahmima anam
july in london was freezing cold. my instinct was to stay indoors and vegetate, but of course london has far too many interesting events. first i headed off to the damien hirst's exhibition 'beyond belief': its highlight was a spectacular diamond skull. cast in platinum from a real skull, it was embedded with 8,601 flawless diamonds but retained the original (terribly white) teeth. on the forehead sat a diamond of some 56 carats. the skull glimmered and shimmered, mounted in a spotlit glass case, the solitary exhibit in a small dark room. hirst's aim was to explore themes of human existence, particularly life and death. a row of paintings portrayed the birth of hirst's child while another, dramatic series was developed from biopsy images of fearful cancers: they had an extraordinary beauty and were scattered with crushed glass and scalpel blades. and yes, i saw saw hirst's dissected animals - a cow divided vertically and shark longitudinally, each half contained in glasses cases filled with formaldehyde. they were not gory or shocking but a celebration of nature, as was hirst's array of fish skeletons of astonishing diversity, shape and curve.

we need a national government
with a rock solid determination for reforms, besides running the affairs of the government in a political vacuum by a council of advisers, it was feared that a spark anywhere might turn into a political firestorm. in dhaka university, the highly politicized student wing came forward to give that a jump start. i commented in my last article published in the daily star on september 18 that the students never really came back from the streets. i wish i were wrong. from a trifling squabble between a few students and young soldiers a different ballgame unfolded. instead of negotiating for peace, when some teachers fueled the fire with political demands like withdrawal of national emergency, resignation of the ig police, home secretary and unconditional apology from the army chief, they certainly lost the moral high-ground. the nation is deeply disappointed with the behavior of the university teachers at a critical time. the unbecoming behavior robbed us- the army of former students, the right to demand their release, but still pray for leniency on humanitarian grounds.
