problems aplenty, prospects bleak
finance minister ama muhith has proposed a new budget with a lot of stress on future reforms and analysis of why things went haywire this year. but his biggest challenges of squeezing out a 7.2 percent growth and strapping inflation remain unchanged.
tax, more tax it needs
owing to what the finance minister called a gradual decline in international trade-based revenues, the government is making all-out efforts to boost revenue from domestic sources, thereby forcing people to carry a heavy tax burden.
surplus electricity from next year?
in the budget speech, the finance minister projected that within the next fiscal year, there will be huge surplus power as a result of implementation of dozens of power projects.
budget shifts into big spending gear
the outlay of the next fiscal year has been increased by 19 percent from the 2011-2012 revised budget to fix it at tk 1,91,738 crore, which is 18.1 percent of gross domestic product (gdp).
pay more for cars
prices of all non-commercial vehicles like cars, microbuses and sport utility vehicles would go up as the government plans to impose supplementary duties on their imports from the next fiscal year.
minimum tax rises to tk 3,000
despite soaring inflation, the tax-free income limit remains at tk 1.80 lakh in the proposed budget.
time to say bye to a few items

hurdles pretty high to clear
the government will face formidable challenges in implementing its budget for the fiscal year 2012-13, analysts said in their immediate reactions yesterday.
alone in car? pay tolls
finance minister ama muhith came up with an idea to ease the ever-deteriorating traffic congestion by introducing road pricing and taxing people into carpooling.
it's impossible to implement
though the proposed budget is not highly ambitious, its implementation will be impossible due to uncertainty about funds and the government's administrative inability, the main opposition bnp said yesterday.
essentials hang in int'l balance
the general public has little to cheer about the budgetary steps since those measures alone are unlikely to relieve them of higher prices of essentials.
mission inflation impossible
the government targets to contain inflation at 7.5 percent in the forthcoming fiscal year, heartened by this year's bumper food production, falling commodity prices on the global market and promises of higher foreign exchange supply.
43pc higher goal set for foreign aid
the government has proposed to set the foreign assistance target at tk 26,442 crore in the upcoming fiscal year to finance its development projects.
farm subsidy inadequate
the government has deferred its target time for attaining food autarky from 2012 to 2013 and proposed a farm subsidy outlay that seems far short of the requirement.
police may get separate probe unit
finance minister ama muhith yesterday emphasised the need for creating a separate investigation unit to strengthen the police force.
3 shots in the arm of ailing stocks
the troubled stockmarket will get three more incentives in the next fiscal year, in addition to the existing ones, as part the government's efforts to strengthen and stabilise the capital market.

gdp growth target set at 7.2pc
the gross domestic product (gdp) growth for the next fiscal year has been set at 7.2 percent expecting that trade and agriculture will continue to thrive and the global economy will turn around by 2013.
rail on priority, roads ignored
while delivering the budget speech yesterday, the finance minister gave some hope for the development in the railway sector but painted a disappointing picture on improving road communication and easing traffic congestion.
woman murdered in front of mother in capital
criminals strangled a 46-year-old woman right before her septuagenarian mother in their topkhana residence in the capital before looting tk 35,000 and six property deeds on tuesday night.
social safety net shrinks
allocation for social safety net programmes (ssnps) has gone down by two percentage points in the proposed budget, which according to an analyst is a reflection of financing challenge for the government.
taka-whitening device in place
yet again, the government has given the money-whitening scope for influential groups.

inundation of the port city
it is unfortunate that chittagong city has come to be ailed by the same problem that the capital and indeed most major towns in the country are plagued by water logging. what was quite an unheard of phenomenon in chittagong even after prolonged deluge not many years ago has come to beset the city with the slightest bit of downpour. and all this because of filling up of the catchment areas, unplanned growth of the city and, to top it, all, illegal construction that impedes the natural flow of rainwater, and clogging of the canals that cater to the rain runoff. while this has been the case year after year we wonder why the authorities seem not to be bothered with the public misery. view the page sports

materialise bangabandhu's dream
forty years passed by after independence, yet no one seems to address the core problem the country is facing since the day one of its inception. no did even the fortunate incumbent prime minister, who escaped the gruesome killing as she was living abroad with her (late) professor husband. i wonder why the two-time prime minister sheikh hasina is not interested in implementing her late father's plan into reality. had she implemented the plan that bangabandhu was about to do, many of the problems would have been taken care of by themselves without extra effort. many of the existing problems would have simply vanished with decentralisation as people from far flung areas would not have to throng the capital for a living.

no suits, ties for nine months from march to november, a government circular blurts out of the blue for the government and autonomous bodies. that such an idea sprouted in a fertile brain awash with crisis management quackery cannot be in doubt. but what you puzzle over is the forced dress code. if the rule sticks by you will have dumped your costly summer suits and boots away.
save the euro. no time to waste
after so many bilateral and multilateral summits of european leaders over the past two years on the euro, i cannot help feeling that these politicians are either a bunch of procrastinators or they do not realise that europe is on the edge of a precipice. while they talk, eat dinner or stroll, the ship is sinking little by little. it is as if we are watching a movie in slow motion of a death foretold. no country, not even germany will be able to avoid the consequences of the disaster. how can we avoid it?
what is in a name?
well, a lot is. words have physiognomic properties which influence perception. to shakespeare the fragrance of a rose would remain the same even with a change of nomenclature. suppose we called it "jhotjhotkil" or "quillkerrfiz" and ran an experiment to prove the bard's point of view the results might not tally with his assumption. in the same context take the word "gram" or "grameen." there was a time not very long ago when, for the elite, the pedigreed, the city dwellers, the higher ups, the word "grameen" stood for squalor, a perfume bereft multitude, stench of cow dung, bumpy dirt roads, helplessness and diseases. these things have not changed drastically but a few farsighted, innovative and dedicated men and women have been able to bring about visible and functional change in the stagnant situation. the persian saying "qatra, qatra dariya mee shawad" befits their endeavour.
