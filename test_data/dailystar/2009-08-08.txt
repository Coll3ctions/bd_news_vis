anti corruption drive: the other dimension
going by media reports it would appear that there is worrying dissatisfaction and apparent discomfiture in high places about the nearly stalled anti-corruption drive. reportedly, a large number of criminal cases lodged in 2007 and 2008 would fall through on account of technical flaws that should have been taken note of at appropriate time. at higher policy making level in the government, there is a concern that many heavy weights that amassed huge wealth in questionable manner would be able to break the legal net.
consequence of ill-planned urbanisation
dhaka is used to rains. it is also used to stoppages. several times every monsoon, the city's workforce finds itself grid-locked or stranded. everyone wades home after a few exhausting hours, and the next morning things return to normal. but on tuesday (july 28) it was different. the city that never stops shut down.
globalisation and growth
the link between globalisation and economic growth has been a subject of intense scrutiny by policy-makers, economists, civil society leaders and the media for quite some time. there are many who argue persuasively that integration with the global economy accelerates growth. no less persuasive are the arguments to the contrary. the recent global meltdown has given added ammunition for the critics. the arguments and counterarguments are fairly well-known. considering the limitations of space those will not be repeated here. however, given the contradictory positions of the proponents and the opponents, it would be fair to suggest that the relationship between globalisation and growth needs to be explored empirically. accordingly, i have reviewed the growth experiences of 12 asian countries covering the period 1980 to 2009. countries examined are bangladesh, china, india, indonesia, korea, malaysia, pakistan, the philippines, singapore, sri lanka, thailand and vietnam. the statistical findings and the key messages emanating therefrom are presented below. view the page environment
our imperilled water
as we enter the era of climate change, it is becoming increasingly evident that access to safe drinking water is going to be one of the major challenges around the globe, especially for arid and developing regions of the world. for most part of the developed world the risk of microbial contamination of drinking water is significantly lower. as a result those countries are focusing on chemical contaminants. in the developing and underdeveloped world people are still under constant threat of microbial contamination of drinking water. the recurrence of diarrhea every year in bangladesh and the recent cholera outbreak in zimbabwe are some examples that substantiate the prevailing risk.
climate change and conflict
five complementary mechanisms have been proposed to link broad climate change/variability processes to conflict. these are :
cdm--a climate change mitigation technology
clean development mechanism (cdm) is one of the most flexible and sustainable mitigation mechanisms established by the article-12 of the agreed protocol of un conference on climate change in rio in 1992. basically cdm refers to climate change mitigation project functioned by both developing and developed countries where the developing countries kick off projects, donor agencies or developed countries make capital outlay to the projects which eventually cause emission reduction of green house gases (ghgs), mainly carbon. the certified emission reduction (cer) credits will be sold to the developed countries. so, a successful cdm project fetches benefit for both host developing countries and patronizing developed countries. view the page literature
tracking down savitry roy
when i discovered savitry roy it was like finding hidden treasure. most readers of bangla language fiction will be unacquainted with the writer or her work. but, to me, she is one of the major authors to have written on the tebhaga movement, the great historical and social event in the bygone chronicle of a bengal that included both present-day bangladesh and west bengal.
cricket: the fastest ball at dhaka stadium
the speedster, the fast bowler, occupies a special place in a cricket team. he is an object of fascination, zeus with the thunderbolts. in his hand the red leather orb - yet untouched, yet un-bowled - lurks, with the potential to annihilate and lay waste the pretensions of batting maestros, and capable of instilling such blind terror that the battle is half won before it's even been joined. it's only when the opening salvo fails to rip apart the defences of the opposing side that that the contest settles into into its battle of attrition and guerrilla warfare, with its caves and long marches across the yunan. but first comes the cavalry charge across the open plains, and the corresponding lush warmth generated among the spectators by its open surrender to the atavistic, primitive core which is at the heart of all sports where speed is king, and which in cricket resides in the team's speed merchants. the gods first have to be appeased.
the man from deir gassanah
'the man from deir gassanah' - that's how mourid barghouti described himself to a friend of mine in london. deir gassanah is the name of the village outside ramallah that barghouti once called home, and to which he returned on a visit after almost thirty years later when it was under israeli occupation. the exile was a forced one. he was in cairo studying english literature (yeats and eliot were the only things he cared about then), when the 1967 arab-israeli war broke out. that war saw the israeli occupation of the west bank, and the subsequent beginning of an occupation whose continuing cruelty and barbarity continue to exact a heavy toll of its original arab inhabitants. "the essential american soul," wrote d.h. lawrence in a celebrated description, "is hard, isolate, stoic, and a killer." had he been alive today, he would have changed the words to 'israeli soul.' view the page star health
skin care in the monsoon
you may love the rain but too much moisture in this weather may cause harm to your beloved skin. depending on the skin type, humid and wet weather causes unusual activities on the surface of the skin and leads to oily, patchy, and dry skin. soaked skin particularly of the feet and legs, is very much prone to fungal infections. with a little precaution and simple measures we can save ourselves a lot of misery over bad skin.
female condom and women’s empowerment
female now account for half of all people infected by hiv in developing countries. female condom which can make to prevent both hiv transmission and unwanted pregnancy is failed to get sufficient attention of policy makers and women users in bangladesh due to leadership, awareness and price of condom at large. female condoms should be available everywhere for universal access.

she caused a flutter in young hearts
as the train whizzed past dolly, director mashiuddin shaker noticed the terrified look of the train driver, his forehead glistening with perspiration. within a few moments, though, dolly was persuaded by the cast to come down from the railway tracks and a terrible accident was averted. shaker let out a sigh of relief as he had managed to overcome yet another hurdle in the shooting for the film shurjo dighol bari . he already had to cope with changing two previous actresses for the unconventional role and he couldn't bear another mishap.
the rise and fall and rise of politics
bangladesh began its journey as an independent country with a parliamentary system of government. it had been a foregone conclusion in the context of the awami league, which was at the helm of the country's affairs following the liberation war. tragically, however, the first blow to the al's cherished form of government came from the party itself in january 1975 when prime minister sheikh mujibur rahman declared bangladesh as a one-party state with a presidential form of government. since then bangladesh has gone through military and civil-military authoritarian rule before the parliamentary form of government was reintroduced in bangladesh in 1991 through the 12th amendment to the constitution. it was indeed a positive development since the amendment was carried through bipartisan move i.e., with the consensus of the two major political parties, the bangladesh nationalist party and the awami league. great hope was raised in the country about the successful operation of parliamentary government. unfortunately, however, expectations regarding an effective parliamentary system ensuring good governance in the country remained as elusive as ever despite bringing in the institution of non-party, neutral caretaker government, against the backdrop of confrontation between the al and the bnp over the holding of free and fair elections.
