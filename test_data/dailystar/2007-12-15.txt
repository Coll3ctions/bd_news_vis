engaging with british muslims -ii
ed bateman, chief superintendent of the metropolitan police in london, was quite clear about the responsibilities britain's law enforcers needed to carry out. with the afro-caribbean angry young men of the not so distant past now replaced by their asian counterparts in the united kingdom, it was priorities that mattered. he informed the group of journalists on a visit to london at the invitation of the foreign and commonwealth office that the focal point of those priorities was policing not so much actual incidents of violence as threats of violence. that was one way of keeping the confidence of the various ethnic communities in the country. and policing the threat surely seemed to be working. in the past few years, 120 individuals suspected to be engaged in terrorist plots, of which there had been anywhere between four and six, had been locked up. a significant thrust of the police, said bateman, was reaching out to the muslim community, to those members of it who upheld the ideals of a tolerant democracy and could in turn exercise their influence on those prone to falling back on a misguided policy of using faith as an explanation for their acts of violence. but he admitted that in certain cases, particularly where islamic television channels were involved, reaching out to a section of muslims proved pretty intractable.

crimson sun
it was not the drip-drip-drip of water from the leaves of the mango trees that awoke him, nor was it the gnawing pain in his side that caused him to open his bloodshot eyes to the impenetrable darkness. rather, it was the realisation of what had passed before, those terrible events of what could not have been more than mere hours ago, and yet seemed to him an eternity, another lifetime. chandrapaul ghosh started as he awoke, the dampness that seeped through his lungi bringing with it waves of painful awareness that flowed like contraband liquor through his veins, from the soles of his feet, over the leathery skin of his scabbed knees, through his emaciated torso and into that space where it was rumoured that some men were said to have a heart. he did not feel he had a heart just then, only a dull, throbbing, juddering piece of flesh within the confines of his ribcage that screamed “ bachao-bachao!” incessantly with every beat. chandra was no stranger to prejudice; he was not unacquainted with mindless hatred. he had known his time had come ever since that first burst of gunfire and the bloodshed had begun. what hope for him when the very men that prostrated themselves before the great creator and professed allegiance towards their “brotherhood” had themselves drawn swords upon each other?

one man, his politics and his humour
politics without repartee and politicians without wit can often turn out to be an abrasive concoction. and it is especially in these present, some would say mediocre, times that a sense of humour in politicians remains acute by its conspicuous absence. we are rather unfortunate that ours happens to be an age when, for much of the time, we laugh at politicians rather than laugh with them. that is the pity, given that there used to be a time when men like piloo mody, atal behari vajpayee, syed badrudduja, sheikh mujibur rahman, john f. kennedy and ronald reagan injected good doses of humour into their politics and left people feeling pretty light-hearted, even jocular, about conditions that were otherwise quite weighty.
stories like an assortment of chocolate
in this age of feminism, reading a collection of women's short stories is like adding more flowers to a bouquet. in a world where women become stronger everyday, coming up with a collection such as the penguin book of contemporary women's short stories is like another milestone. master story tellers like maeve binchey , angela carter, nadine gordimer, mary lavin and many others have accumulated their tales in this book. the book is like a mountain of treasure waiting to be discovered. in the richly imagined stories the book plunges the reader into the borderland between opposing forces; youth and age, exclusion and privilege, alien and the familiar.
tales of beauty and travel
the romantic is the title of this book. most of our readers, indeed most people in general, are very familiar with this word. this word carries a meaning, which is that relating to the person who likes to voyage through the imaginative and artistic world which is so far removed from the realistic world. but it is true that romantic people as a rule want to stay in their dream world. one can see that dreams are essentially part of the natural world.
experiencing an embryonic narrative voice
the white castle is a memoir the fictional memoir of a young venetian scholar with the knowledge of science who is captured by the turks. his commonsense medicinal skills appear uncommon to the pasha and this saves his life, though all his companions suffer death. soon our nameless narrator is offered a position in society if he converts to the public faith. at his refusal to be a convert, he is tormented and one day ordered to be beheaded. this is when a courtier called hoja, who considers everybody else 'fools', intrudes and saves the narrator's life. our miserable scholar becomes a slave to hoja.

perween hasan
i.b.taurus
for students of history, this ought to be an immensely satisfying book. perween hasan takes readers on a comprehensive journey through an important component of bangladesh's historical traditions. her search has been of a broad structure, as the text so clearly reveals. the price of the book is something readers might find difficult to meet.
