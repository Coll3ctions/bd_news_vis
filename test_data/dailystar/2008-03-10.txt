whither rule of law?
one may argue with the contents of the letter of dr. abdul moyeen, published in the daily star of 29-2-08 under the given caption, albeit it is difficult to contradict his noteworthy conclusion that “everybody knows how corruption had spread during the five-year rule of the bnp-jamaat, and how the country was run by the family of the pm and her son's office, hawa bhaban. instead of taking any firm actions against those, the government has given its leaders a fairly royal treatment with almost no cases being filed against them and many of them are still at large, especially the ones who belong to the jamaat.” i believe that the ctg ( caretaker government) would come forward to address this wide spread perception. further, the following points also demand immediate remedy by the authorities.
