cec's reflections on elections
chief election commissioner a.t.m. shamsul huda has stated that the sooner the voter list is prepared and general elections are held the sooner the emergency will be lifted in the country. his views are those that the nation by and large shares. indeed, the cec's statement comes after a flurry of positive signals we have been getting from the government. a few days ago, chief adviser fakhruddin ahmed, during his visit to new york, reiterated at nearly every stage of it his government's determination to hold the polls on schedule. there have even been hints that if the voter list is ready, elections might be held earlier than scheduled. an additional sign of how election fever might be taking hold of the country comes through the cec's view that local bodies' polls will be held from january next year. of course, the cec expects that for that to happen, the emergency will need to be relaxed by the end of december.

whither bangladesh cricket?
the way bd lost to sri lanka on 18 sep in the 20/20 quarterfinals is pathetic; but predicable. the ad hoc mentality of the batsmen. our bowlers are more professional. it is a great headache for the international coaches to change the mentality of the boys. dave whatmore spent several years in grooming batches of our young men, but the inbuilt psychological barriers remain. the bccb has to be reinforced with professionals; not politically motivated guest appointees enjoying a holiday. if you don't know how to improve the game, get out and make room for others. and don't interfere-- no bureaucracy and red-tapism.
tourism in bangladesh
my attention was drawn to an op ed article by mr. farooque hasan published in the daily star on 9/27/07. he mentioned that bangladesh received only 200,000 foreign tourists compared to 1 million by cambodia. in my opinion the actual number of 'real' tourists in bangladesh in 2006 was far less. anybody entering bangladesh on a tourist visa is counted as a tourist. unfortunately, the vast majority of these so called tourists are actually native born bangladeshis holding foreign passports and visiting their relatives. very few of them actually visit a tourist spot or spend money like a tourist when in bangladesh. the inflated number of tourists only makes the ministry of tourism look good which has no economic impact on the country. i visit bangladesh every two years on a tourist visa and i don't consider myself a tourist in the conventional sense.

the nbr has extended the date for filing income tax returns but has said that it would not extend the date for declaring undisclosed or undeclared money. as a banker i can say with impunity that the bulk of money deposited in banks by stakeholders in the form of certificates and fixed deposits have not been declared as it is time consuming and cumbersome. if they had done so there would have been a run on the banks.
iran's mission
i am writing to you in regard to the recent visit by dr. ahmadinejad, the iranian president, to the united states. he was subsequently invited by columbia university to deliver a speech to interested students. i am sure you are aware of the media frenzy this event generated in america. i have listened to his entire speech at columbia university (http:// www.president.ir/en/) and as many conscientious people would agree, i believe he did a great job. i have also read the entire transcript of his interview earlier this week with the cbs network in america. he raises fundamental questions and refutes some of the mind-boggling myths that the west had been perpetuating against the islamic republic of iran and on a personal level against the president himself.
hindu deities
i wonder if it is proper to describe hindu deities as 'idols' as mentioned by k. karmaker to describe the deity of goddess durga, september 27, 2007. (craftsmen may be idol or "putul-makers," but deities are not idols.) if you do not like the word deity, you may use “murti” as english-speaking hindus in the caribbean and south america have been using for over one century, or perhaps image, sculpture or even “pratima” as used in kali and durga worshipping west bengal, rest of india and nepal. unfortunately, there is no equivalent word in english.

musharraf's position

castro and guevara
ernesto guevara de la serna commonly known as che guevara was born on june 14, 1928 in argentina and he was known as the marxist revolutionary and a great political figure. he was also known as the leader of cuban and internationalist guerillas. che guevara had traveled a lot throughout south america and during that he had seen the miserable condition of the people and he came to the conclusion that these inequalities could only be removed by revolution. after his death che guevara became an icon of socialist revolutionary movements.
