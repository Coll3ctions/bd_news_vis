new political realities in nepal
the electorally victorious maoists in nepal have served notice on king gyanendra that he must leave narayanhiti palace in the next four weeks. the move is certainly an indication of the dramatic way politics has been transformed in a kingdom about to turn itself into a republic. there is no question that the emergence of the maoists as a pre-eminent force in nepalese politics was as sudden as it was unforeseen. that only places a heavy burden of responsibility on them as they prepare to take charge of the country's next government. for the maoists, at this point, it becomes necessary to acknowledge the confidence reposed in them by the electorate and move on to build a durable democratic structure in the country.
trees on du campus
we are alarmed at the rate century old trees have been going down on the pristine campus of dhaka university. after standing tall for decades they are being cut down to make room for some brick and mortar structures. in the past, powerful yet unscrupulous factions within the student parties sold off valuable trees from the campus. it was a shameful act that went unchallenged.
elections in nepal
elections are held to enhance the welfare of the people. in developed countries it is taken for granted that the party that wins majority of votes from an electorate that has given thought to the words spoken by the candidates and the party manifestos forms the government.
inflated egos
is inflation some kind of a sudden plague, which hits without warning, spreads contagious havoc for a while and then disappears as mysteriously as it came? finance ministers would love such an explanation, wouldn't they? government propagandists could command a high premium from their masters if they managed to sell such a myth. unhappily for governments, and fortunately for mere mortals, the voter is not gullible.
hillary clinton's sister souljah moment
recent successful white democratic presidential candidates, who were perceived to be pro-black, had sent coded messages to blue-collar white voters assuring them that whatever they may have said on the campaign trail, they were actually “one of them.” candidate jimmy carter did so by saying in 1976 that there should be some “racial purity” in the residential neighbourhoods. meaning: blacks and whites should not necessarily be neighbours. and bill clinton invented the sister souljah moment in 1992. view the page sports

hussey whacks punjab
a pair of australians, in what was more pura cup action than indian premier league (ipl), treated a buzzing mohali crowd to a run-filled saturday clash as the bandwagon moved north. unfortunately for kings xi punjab, james hopes's 32-ball 71 couldn't overhaul a massive target of 241, while the chennai super kings had their western australia specialist michael hussey to thanks for a massive total. his scintillating unbeaten 114, another superb exhibition for this juiced-up format, left punjab a mountain to climb and with yuvraj singh dethroned early they could only muster 207 for 4.
marauding mccullum
the opening ceremony was a spectacular affair, but what followed was even more breathtaking, as brendon mccullum destroyed the home team in the inaugural match of the ipl. in what was a brutal one-man assault on the bangalore royal challengers, mccullum blasted an unbeaten 158 from a mere 73 deliveries, the highest score in a twenty20 match, to propel kolkata knight riders to an imposing 222 for 3. the punch-drunk bangalore team was in no condition to fight back after that battering, and collapsed limply to 82 to lose by an embarrassing margin of 140 runs, the fourth-largest defeat in this sort of match.
rules bent in a month
less than a month after announcing a final list of players for the dlf indian premier league (ipl) that kicked off on friday at bangalore, the organisers of the twenty20 tournament seem to have forgotten it by allowing some franchise teams to include additional players.
yousuf ignored for twenty20
pakistan on friday dropped experienced batsman mohammad yousuf for their first ever home twenty20 international, against bangladesh.
high on entertainment
if you needed any proof that few of the spectators saw the indian premier league (ipl) as anything more than glitzy entertainment, it arrived after the seventh over of the royal challengers' comically inept innings. while sourav ganguly warmed up for a bowl, with the scoreboard showing a dismal 33 for 4, the boom box started playing a popular kannada tune. the crowd roared with approval. could you think of one serious sport where a home crowd of 55,000 would be cheering with their team being cut to pieces as though with a sushi knife? neither could we.

chelsea sweat on drogba, ballack
avram grant endured the demands of television schedulers over the rearrangement of chelsea's premier league fixture at everton only through gritted teeth but, privately at least, the stamford bridge manager may now appreciate previously unforeseen benefits in the fixture switch. injuries threaten to decimate his options ahead of next week's champions league semifinal first-leg tie against liverpool so, in the circumstances, any extra days to recuperate are gratefully received.

serena downs maria
serena williams continued her domination of maria sharapova with a 7-5, 4-6, 6-1 win in the quarterfinals of the 1.3 million dollar wta family circle cup on friday.
james eyes lord's test
james anderson has known some dramatic peaks and troughs during his five-year england career, and his recent tour of new zealand provided a perfect microcosm. he was recalled for the second test in wellington and starred with five first-innings wickets en route to a series-turning victory, but one match later in napier his form had fallen away, and he was dispatched for more than six an over by stephen fleming in the first innings and matthew bell in the second.
setting the bar
one of the few less-publicised aspects of the indian premier league (ipl) concerns the orange helmet kept at each of the eight franchise venues. after each round of matches this strange accessory -- the ipl's answer to the tour de france's yellow jersey -- is handed to the competition's leading run-scorer. after tonight's piece de resistance at the chinnaswamy, it will take something bordering on the miraculous to deprive brendon mccullum of his dubious honour.
champions league in october?
following the spectacular start to the indian premier league (ipl), its organisers have chalked out plans for an inaugural champions league featuring top domestic twenty20 sides from several countries.
ryder doubtful for eng tour

beyond human resources
while waiting for some guests at the sonargaon hotel lobby, my human resources colleague saidul was greeted by a hotel official. saidul then introduced kazi rakibuddin ahmed who handed me his card director people innovation & education. noticing my inquiring appearance, rakib volunteered, “yes, that's an unusual way of looking at hr. and you are not the first one to react!” it certainly was an odd title, and of course my management instinct got the better of me and i asked him if we could meet so he could explain what was this all about.

national agriculture policy

'resumption' of train service
it is wrong to suggest that dhaka- kolkata train service has been resumed after 43 years with effect from pahela baishakh 1415. resumption relates to an issue which was in operation in the past and then restarted. in the case of dhaka -kolkata there has never been a direct rail link between the two cities. so the question of resumption of train services does not arise. one should term the event as introduction for the first time of direct rail link between dhaka and kolkata which has been possible with the construction of jamuna bridge. it may be mentioned here that prior to this, 43 years ago, trains used to run from dhaka to jagannathganj and then the passengers had to cross the river jamuna by ferry.
pahela baishakh
welcome bangla year 1415. pahela baishakh is a great festival for us. it is nice to see thousands of people on the streets wearing saree and panjabi. that gives me a feeling of great happiness. it is true that we are not happy in our daily life because of price hike, load-shedding, water shortage and so on. but we want to forget all our sorrows on joyous occasions.
footpaths
footpath is a mysterious issue in our country! when political governments were in power we saw the media being vocal for freeing the footpaths from the illegal occupants. when this ctg started the drive against these occupants we saw the media appreciating it except the issue of evicting hawkers. but now everything is back to square one!
sad truth
i read in the newspaper that the prices of hilsa fish rose by 50-100% before pahela baishakh. why?
attack on police
the incidents of last 10th and 11th april are obviously worrying. in the name of opposing the women's development policy, the bigots used the national mosque as the shield! some so called pro(?) islamic groups attacked the police using the mosque! it has also been learnt that the bigots used sticks and other weapons kept inside the mosque.
patients and doctors
the other night i along with my friend, who was suffering from severe pain in his backbone, went to consult a doctor. my friend had the pain all of a sudden and it was so acute that he could not even sit in the waiting room. as we did not make any appointment earlier, i repeatedly requested the man in charge of the chamber to give us an urgent appointment but in vain. then i requested him to give me permission to talk to the doctor and unfortunately i again failed. he said that he would be rebuked for allowing me to talk to the doctor. he further said that nobody would be allowed to see the doctor without prior appointment. in the meantime the condition of my friend was deteriorating. so we went to a private hospital and took the emergency treatment from a doctor.
student politics
chief of the judicial commission justice habibur rahman placed the report on the violent incidents on and around dhaka university campus in august last year to chief adviser fakhruddin ahmed on november 15 last year. it was officially published on 23 march, with 28-point recommendations that include a ban on teacher and student politics by amending the dhaka university order 1973 and repealing the political parties regulations 1976, if necessary.
we need a change
before the liberation war of '71, bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman gave people the hope of liberating them from the pakistani tyrants. the people of this country fought hard to get rid of the killers. we got liberated, and the moment we started to see glimmers of hopes, our father of the nation was brutally and mercilessly killed by some ruthless and ignorant enemies of this nation. since that time all hopes just simply faded away.
train to kolkata
i wonder why trains will run only once every week between dhaka and kolkata. can people travelling for business stay a whole week before returning? but what is even more perplexing is that both trains from dhaka and kolkata travel out the same day and return back on the same day. this is another amazing schedule, certainly not designed to serve the customers. presumably, the border stations will be manned for only two days in a week and closed for the reminder of the days.
environmental problems
bangladesh suffers from a wide range of environmental problems, arising from drought, flood and other natural hazards because of its geographical location. frequency of hazards is on the increase day by day. the quality of soil has deteriorated due to excessive use of agrochemicals, unplanned land use, undesirable encroachment on forest areas for agriculture and settlements and indiscriminate disposal of hazardous industrial wastes. unplanned land use and intrusion of saline water are causing degradation of soil in the coastal areas.
empowering women
we all want women to be empowered and also think that bangladeshi women enjoy more respect and honour compared to the women the world over. we also admit that we have a lot more to do. islam has empowered women in the best possible way (though the so called intellectuals without having adequate knowledge say that islam has suppressed women) and changing the sharia will not only be a great blow to the feelings of the common people of our country but will also be a major setback to the scheme of empowering women.
follow good examples
i heard from reliable elders that during the 1943 bengal famine, dhaka nawab families (ahsan manzil-based 2nd family and armanitola-based 3rd family) had changed their eating habits: whole-grain chapati (servants' food) was included and 'faan' (rice-starch/'maar') was not spared. this is one of the reasons why people had confidence in them and they were the leaders of their times.
maximising resource utilisation
this letter is in response to gen. moeen's interesting article in your bangla new year issue of april 14th.
rights of women
i applaud the recent move by the government to recognise the right of women in the delicate issue of inheritance. for the last 16 years, our country was ruled by female heads of state, yet none of the past administrations recognised the plight of women in inheritance. due to lack of any initiative and rules regarding the issue, many of our mothers, sisters and aunts have suffered sheer injustice and inequality. i have witnessed this form of injustice against my mom.
cartoon on corruption
i am referring to sharier's cartoon published in the daily star on apr. 2 in which it was pointedly shown the mindset of the powers that be! on a weighing scale, some prominent leaders of the awami league and the bnp were put on either side of the scale.
number of doctors
the ministry of health & family welfare of bangladesh claims that the country has a doctor patient ratio of 1:3169, considering all the doctors (42,881) registered so far with the bm & dc. however, there is a gross error in the report on working physicians (govt. & private) available for care & treatment of ailing patients. because, many of the doctors (42,881) registered so far with the bm & dc have already expired (dead) & many of the doctors (42,881) registered so far with the bm & dc have left bangladesh, working abroad (many of whom will not return as they have accepted citizenship of foreign countries), & many of the doctors (42,881) registered so far with the bm & dc are no longer involved in medicare & treatment, that is, they are either involved in business or some other profession, or retired, i.e., they are quite old and infirm for involvement in care & treatment of the people of bangladesh. when all these factors are rightly considered, the number of working & living physicians (govt. & private) available for care & treatment of ailing patients would be probably less than 13,000. thus there seems to be a gross error in the report on working physicians available for medicare. this error needs to be corrected. as the ministry of health & family welfare is run by bureaucrats, who de facto possess no responsibility, they will take no steps to correct the statistical errors of health, the bm & dc, the dghs, the bma should take the pioneering role in correcting all discrepancies in health statistics. the bm & dc should first enlist the registered doctors who are living & working in bangladesh. the bm & dc should enlist the registered doctors who have already expired. they should also enlist the registered doctors who are no longer involved in the profession. moreover, a good number of registered doctors are involved in health administration, who are in no way directly involved in caring & treating patients. they should also be enlisted. the dghs & the bma can't avoid their responsibility in correcting the errors in health statistics.
structured questions
i have read the article of dr. siddiqur rahman of dhaka university, in the prthom alo . his analysis is very nice. education is the backbone of a nation. some corrupt people and businessmen are trying to destroy it. i think this system should be revised and it may be started gradually from class six onward, not directly for the students of class nine(that is on ssc exams). view the page international
