with the movement proceeding smoothly, despite a series of provocative acts by the pakistan army and also through its encouragement of bihari resistance to bangabandhu's political programme in such areas of dhaka city as mirpur and mohammadpur, a pattern had set in. of course, to much amazement and public outrage, the non-bengali bihari community in mirpur and mohammadpur refused to observe the general strike that was going on all over the province and even went around intimidating bengali residents of the areas if they so much as expressed support for the awami league programme.

under-staffed missions
foreign minister dipu moni states that as many as forty three bangladesh missions abroad are faced with a shortage of manpower. her assessment is simple, which is that such a shortage is impeding the provision of adequate services to non-resident bangladeshis. the manpower structure under which the missions have been operating, the minister reminds us, was approved way back in 1982. obviously, in today's circumstances there needs to be a change in the structure, as dr. moni appears to be suggesting. we do not disagree with her where revising the structure is concerned.
busting market syndicate
prime minister sheikh hasina has again warned of tough action against unscrupulous traders' syndicates and hoarders behind artificially hiking up essentials prices and creating food grain crisis in the market. earlier too she on different occasions had issued similar warnings against dishonest traders. to all appearances, the prime minister's tough words have been lost on the coteries responsible for hoarding and various kinds of market distortion. because so far the prices of daily essentials have hardlyshown any sign of coming down. view the page sports
bangladesh v england

all women are 'worth it'!
as a woman, i am obviously concerned to raise the status of all women and, as a teacher it is natural for me to want also to raise their level of education and their contribution to the economy. however, there seems to be an assumption floating around that one depends on the other and so it is alright to behave badly towards a woman who is uneducated or not contributing to the family's income!
history of hounding
two articles that appeared in the editorial page of your esteemed daily on march 2 definitely drew the attention of many. syed badrul ahsan, a staunch supporter of awami league, wrote the history of hounding the leaders and intellectuals by rulers since pre-independence era. he has elaborately drawn a picture how ayub-monaem clique tried to hound the personality like bangabandhu. he writes how the present government is chasing man of letters like dr. serajul islam chowdhury and the nation's pride nobel laureate dr. muhammad yunus. he, like thousands, expected dr. yunus as a guest of honour with dr. amartya sen at the opening ceremony of ekushey boi mela. like the writer, we all are frustrated and disappointed at the narrowness of the organisers.
facebook mania
facebook is one of the largest social networks throughout the world. it is very effective and really helps us to be updated with all the old friends and share the best moments of our lives and also provides many more entertainments. it has attracted the people of all age, class and gender. but when kids of junior classes get attracted to it, they get distracted from many works which they are supposed to do. so, parents should be aware about this matter as this is becoming a serious problem.
we need airport
there has been a huge outcry and protests regarding the building of a new airport, but i suppose this is in many ways justified. here i mention some of the problems at hs international airport:
controlling emotions
shame on the people who attacked the west indies team bus! (if they meant it for our own team, shame on them for that, too!) things like that give bangladesh a bad name. cheers to the ones who apologized (for the shameful act that they'd never have done, themselves)!! thanks to the daily star for publishing that! if people could only learn to control their emotions, the world would have been a better place.
we should act reasonably
too much of anything is not good; we overtly react on many occasions. when in the icc cricket world cup 2011, bangladesh defeated ireland, people acted as though we have won the world cup. in the celebration which followed, many people were injured, and a few were even killed.
misuse of law
the senseless killing of shahbaz bhatti, pakistan's federal minister for minorities is unacceptable and disgraceful. there must be more tolerance of views, especially for minority communities. there is nothing wrong with the blasphemy law as it stands, what is wrong is the implementation and misuse of the law by people and this needs to be looked at.
yunus and government
it has been quite a long time that we are witnessing something is going wrong between prof. yunus and the government. i, like many others, do not really know the reason(s) behind this episode. the whole nation is proud of dr. yunus, the man who has earned a nobel prize for bangladesh.

fighting over fig leaves
some men always tend to forget, or they don't bother to remember, that behind each of them breathing, there is a woman who gave birth to him. it is said there is also a woman behind every successful man. smart alecks often joke there is more than one woman behind every miserable man. the purpose of saying all these is neither to glorify nor demonise women. it is simply to recognise that they surround men. in all fairness, men also surround them.
clannish contagion
the middle east is in turmoil. muammar's mayhem continues. his 42-year old regime is under siege but he will hold on as long he can and at any cost. libya is his fiefdom and he flaunted his invulnerability by promoting his clan of a loyal army, his obsequious supporters and his sons saif-al-islam and mutassim.
pleasure is all mine
nero was playing his flute as rome lay burning -- a classics imagery that finds a distended application in today's world. it is in the make-believe existence that political figures nowadays stray and takes flights into.
