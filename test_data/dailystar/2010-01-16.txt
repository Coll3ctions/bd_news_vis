european hemeroby approach for appropriate measuring
nature conservation anchors a discourse that articulates a nexus of nature-culture-artificiality-stability-biodiversity. the concepts of human disturbances have been enjoying increasing popularity in the discussion of biodiversity conservation. anthropogenic behaviour that harms nature" or “human activities contrary to nature" leads to unnatural conditions. the notions of pure naturalness are totally dogmatic and the present environmental conditions are the products of a plethora of human disturbances. human activities are the result of evolution of the other life forms in the biosphere. the homo faber ("man the maker") plays the most significant role on the highly complex manipulations of the nature.

the tree-man
1
the stretched grilled veranda along the bedroom was so narrow that one would only use it for dry clothes or mature pickles. yet the young bride from the second floor would come to the veranda whenever she could. there would be only buildings to stare at though some covering the mighty sky; others reducing their distance with the sky with every opportunity, enforcing a chaotic surrounding. the only saving grace was the plot next to theirs, where no building was yet to be built. it had a long tin-shed house where several families lived. the place also contained three trees within its boundary a date-palm tree, a guava tree and a boroi tree.
like a candle melting down
there is something about bleakness, about snowfall, that causes some of the saddest thoughts to well up in you. the sight of an old book, the death of a celebrated playwright, remembrance of a year, images of graves far away . . . these and similar workings of the mind are what you encounter as the winds howl and daybreak does not show much of a difference with twilight. you watch the flakes fall to the ground, wondering all the while what could be happening to the birds that on sunlit days flit across your window many times over. and then you hear television dwelling on the danger that birds are confronted with if the snow refuses to melt. these tiny emblems of creation, always foraging for morsels in the grass, do not have it in their beaks to probe through the snow and into the soil.
marriage, its pains and its pleasures
a psychologist has cautioned certain categories of men and women against marrying. he seems as least generous enough not to generalize as thales, an ancient greek philosopher, did long ago --- 'for a young man not yet and for an elder man not at all.” i would like to ask readers not to heed the philosopher in order to be spared the confusion and frustration, which such marriage-related views may lead to.

outcome of bangladesh-india summit 2010
condoleezza rice, during an official visit to india in 2005, had described bangladesh as the “next afghanistan”. it was, thus, for very good reasons that the indians were greatly excited when the awami league won the 2008 elections by a massive margin. the assurance given by sheikh hasina within days of becoming prime minister that bangladesh would not allow its territory to be used for carrying out insurgency against india was welcomed in india with great enthusiasm, both by the ruling congress and the opposition bjp. by her just-concluded state visit to india, sheikh hasina signed and sealed that assurance by signing three security related agreements that would give the indians the handle over its insurgents who either hide in bangladesh or are inclined to cross over to bangladesh in search of sanctuary. the agreements ensure that all that india had wanted and expected on the important issue of security from bangladesh has been delivered. it was mamata banarjee who perhaps spilled india glee over these three agreements when, after a meeting with sheikh hasina, she told waiting reporters that india must give bangladesh whatever it wanted.
mutual trust restored
bangladesh prime minister sheikh hasina's landmark four-day visit (10-14th january) to india has created an excellent environment of mutual trust that will lay foundations for a much more stable and fruitful relationship with india. the two neighbours lacked mutual trust and the visit has been successful in restoring the spirit of trust between the countries.

a treat for thinking readers
nothing is more in need at this critical time, when political democracy has re-started but a limping journey, than the publication of a centenary commemorative anthology on abul fazal (1903-1983), the foremost humanist of the country. he was considered the conscience of the nation in his time. though primarily a writer, all his life it has been a trademark with fazal that he participated in and led almost all intellectual and civil movements against the pseudo-religious pakistani autocratic regimes. at the advent of the bangladesh movement abul fazal became a truly national figure guiding the progressive forces with courage and high morale.
