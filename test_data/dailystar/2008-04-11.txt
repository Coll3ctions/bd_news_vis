british home secretary's significant visit
britain's home secretary jacqui smith has been here in dhaka on what was certainly a significant visit. in the course of her trip, she gave people a good deal of food for thought. her unambiguous statement that there are links between terrorist outfits in bangladesh and britain is quite a revelation coming from a senior british government functionary. the reason is simple: rarely in the past has a british cabinet minister, or for that matter any high profile western visitor, been as candid as ms. smith. the issue she talked about in dhaka is one that demands the closest attention. the possible global links between terrorist groups are matters that have persistently exercised minds in bangladesh at various levels of government and also among the general public.

when country needed them most!

the farmers in 32 districts are passing their days amid uncertainty as the boro paddy is affected by unknown diseases over 28,000 acres of land. farmers, mainly cultivating boro, have said that they fear crop failure, as they do not know how to handle the situation.
rice shortage
an ominous shortage of rice globally is looming large over the rice consuming countries of south asia, of which bangladesh tops the list. it appears the rice producing countries of this region are no longer capable of producing the quantity of rice required for feeding the ever increasing population, forcing them to stop their rice export. re-fixation of the export price of rice at $1000 per ton abruptly, instead of $500, by india is a glaring example of how alarming the situation is. the cost of rice if imported at this rate will be not less than tk.80 per kg. which the people of this country will never be able to buy. undoubtedly, bangladesh is going to be the worst affected country as it needs to feed over 150 million people whose staple food is rice, a large portion of which is imported. therefore, it is high time short and long-term strategies are formulated and measures adopted to tackle the situation before it is too late.
acid throwing
acid throwing is one of the worst crimes. it has to be tackled in the strongest possible way and rooted out once and for all. but in spite of punishments prescribed in our penal codes, the situation has not improved.

global changes
basic generation changes are taking place globally, not only in bangladesh, s asia (pakistan), but also in america (us), and central europe (kosovo). the central theme is change in the philosophy of political governance.
islamic tourism
islamic tourism is a pretty talked about topic. islamic countries from the asia pacific region have agreed to form an asia pacific islamic travel and tours federation to “safeguard" the interests of muslim tourists and travel agents. representatives from the four founding member countries - malaysia, indonesia and brunei together with asean neighbour singapore - have agreed to its formation at the recent bumitra islamic tourism forum 2008 in kuala lumpur.
trial of war criminals
the whole nation is united on this point. obviously, people hope that this government will take steps to start the long awaited trial. everybody believes that the war criminals who committed crimes against humanity during 1971 liberation war will finally face trial.
anti-corruption campaign
it is nice to see erudite people belonging to the civil society taking note on the on going anti-corruption campaign and the processions etc. they can also take a stroll down the not so civil part of the city where children are burning under the scorching sun in the never ending line of bdr shops. if the mindless and overzealous jihad against corruption could be driven with some sanity and common sense, instead of making a media circus, these children could attend school, instead of saving some precious money for their poor parents. the advisers always preach transparency and accountability. charity should begin at home!
potato and rice
rice is a staple that mainly supply carbohydrates in our diet. milled rice has a high glycemic index and a poor source of quality nutrients such as essential amino acids, vitamins and minerals. potatoes on the other hand are nutritionally much superior to rice. it contains nutritionally important vitamins, minerals and some important essential amino acids making its protein higher in quality compared to rice. usually a medium potato (150g/5.3 oz) with the skin provides 27 mg vitamin c (45% of the daily value (dv), 620 mg of potassium (18% of dv), 0.2 mg vitamin b6 (10% of dv) and trace amounts of riboflavin, niacin, magnesium, phosphorus, iron, and zinc. the fibre contents of a potato is almost equal to many whole grain breads, pastas, and cereals. it is an important component for heart-wise diet. in addition to vitamins, minerals and fibre, potatoes also contain many phytochemicals, such as carotenoids and polyphenols which were shown to have anti-cancer properties. since potatoes are a good source of potassium with low sodium content, it reduces the risk of high blood pressure and stroke.
doctors' obligations

expatriate students
we are expatriate students or you might say the most hardworking class of bangladeshis. i came to this 'land of opportunity' (australia) about four years ago. i came alone.
shocking decision
we the people of bangladesh depend on rice to feed ourselves. but the prices of rice along with other commodities are increasing rapidly. if this situation goes on one day the country will face a famine. a few days ago, a news report was published in various newspapers that the government was going to buy some new luxury cars for the advisers and the dc's. the decision came as a shock to us because the country is passing through a crisis. according to dr. akbar ali khan(chairman of rrc) the money which will be spent for buying the luxury vehicles could be used to decrease the prices of rice and other household commodities.
war criminals
i believe the time has come to have a lively and frank discussion to understand the meaning of war criminal. i understand the feeling of fellow citizens clamouring for trial of war criminals, and i am all for it. but, what constitutes war criminality?
price hike
poor and middle class people have become sick as they have to struggle hard to survive.
bank branch needed
godagari is an upazila of rajshahi district. it is a place for trade and business.
message for students
most of the students do not understand what the real meaning of life is. i personally do not agree that it is very essential to study hard and get established--otherwise life will be doomed. in fact, these types of ideas compel a student to remain confined to one single world. in my opinion, man has several identities. view the page international

a culture of waste
when we visited delhi a couple of years back, some of my friends were shocked to find the shopping malls closing early in the evening. that would never be the case in dhaka... they wailed, which roughly translated meant so much better “they keep mega-malls open way late, in the hope that a few customers (like us) might go on an unplanned shopping frenzy...! all my explanations on energy conservation, examples of major cities from london to bangkok to singapore to new york where the evening rule applies, fell on deaf years. i can imagine their plight now since starting from february last year, the evening closures rule descended on dhaka also.
