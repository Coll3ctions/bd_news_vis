power crisis
“this government has started to show inefficiency in governing your nation.” these are not my words. these are the words of my foreign buyer. the reason for his remarks is that we do online chat regarding business and for the last couple of days i could not chat with him, nor could i send e-mail to him properly, because of power failure. this really hampered our business due to lack of communication.

bttb
while going through the daily star of 4 march'08 having a write up on bttb's plans to cut call charges, which are still high even after the recent reductions, it struck me as strange and also frustrating that while it is essential to cut the call charges, to be competitive, to retain the present subscribers and also to attract new ones to increase bttb's earnings, why is it that the bttb has so far overlooked/ignored the idea of including india, pakistan, sri lanka & myanmar in the list of countries where one can make economic isd calls? this would definitely increase bttb's earning and as this facility is not provided by the mobile operators, this can attract new subscribers as well.
local government
