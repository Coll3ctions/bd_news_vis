throwing facts to the winds
our sense of disbelief is being stretched a little too far. when prime minister sheikh hasina tells the nation that the responsibility for the on-going scandal around the padma bridge project is for the past bnp government to bear, we wonder if she really thinks bangladesh's people will take her at her word. again, when leader of the opposition khaleda zia tells us that a few rightwing politicians now in prison on charges of war crimes actually committed no such crimes during the liberation war, we are left astounded at the way in which she tries to serve up new history to us. no words can be strong enough to condemn such an assessment of history from the two individuals who have held centre stage in national politics since the early 1980s. both hasina and khaleda know that what they say are unvarnished untruths. must they do it? why must their rhetoric be of such a dismal kind as to leave us all raising questions about their political judgement?

stabilising the stock market
in recent months, bangladesh stock market nosedived to the lowest in years. most of the companies did not provide basic financial data of their companies to the website of sec, dhaka stock exchange and chittagong stock exchange. i have a few suggestions for stabilising the stock market:
tejgaon airport
have we learnt to prioritize our needs? right now it is the choice between the smooth establishment of the metro and an old airport being used by the baf. in the unlikely event of hostilities, they may not last 10 minutes in the air, if they are able to take-off in the first place. the metro, if it ever becomes a reality, will provide fast, comfortable, convenient and cheap transit for the masses, who now clog the jugular of dhaka every day. hundreds of acres of unutilised prime land in the heart of dhaka could provide much needed east-west connecting roads, low-cost housing and industrial/commercial enterprises.

we are amused with the news that nano cars manufactured by the tata motors ltd of india will be available in bangladesh soon. but when it comes to the pricing, we are simply shocked. reportedly, nitol motors will be charging almost tk. 6 lacs for one nano.
public's response to crimes- india and bangladesh
on october 14, 2011, i watched a programme named 'crime patrol' (real life show on indian television). a girl was stabbed 15 times at a bazaar in public. no one appeared to stop or catch the killers, and no one even took the girl to a hospital when the killers went away. they refused to testify against the murderers during police investigation. it reminded me of an incident that occurred in our country a few years back. a businessman killed a helper of a bus in public. therefore, he was beaten to death by public. now, the only question that comes to my mind is, why didn't the public in india take any action against the criminals during the girl's murder? after the incident took place, indian people staged a huge procession demanding justice and created pressure on the police through media. the interesting thing is that in our country public don't wait for the police to come and take action against the criminals, instead they take law in their own hands. it was the indian police who solved the case brilliantly, tracked down the killers and found out their motive behind the killing.

the world according to dipu moni
foreign minister dipu moni's recent remarks invoke the situation from a 1982 hollywood production. in "the world according to garp," walt asked: "daddy, what's gradual school?" garp replied: "oh, gradual school is where you go to school and you gradually find out you don't want to go to school anymore." nearly three years into the office of nation's top diplomat, dipu moni is behaving like someone fresh out of the gradual school of diplomacy. she doesn't wish to be diplomatic anymore.
occupied wall street, seen from abroad
the american mainstream media is gradually beginning to pay attention to the occupy wall street movement and its spinoffs springing up in atlanta, chicago, boston and seattle. but from the very beginning the movement has attracted extensive coverage from al jazeera and other middle eastern news outlets and twitter usersprobably because they recognise the forces that are reshaping politics across their region.
stoking the fire
this is easily a new low that both our top leaders have hit in their exchange of derisive comments. into the halfway point of opposition leader begum khaleda zia's road march, prime minister sheikh hasina had this to say: "how can she (begum zia) be so sure about winning the election if it's held under caretaker government, she could even land up in jail?" she didn't realise that by one such utterance she spoiled much of the appreciation for her hands-off approach to let the road march be, that has been otherwise making rounds.
investment opportunities in agribusiness
