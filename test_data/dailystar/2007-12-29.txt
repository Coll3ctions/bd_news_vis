benazir assassinated
bullets and bombs of maniacs finally found their target in pakistan. they succeeded in stopping the bold strides of benazir bhutto, who, knowing fully well the risks, remained iron-willed against forces set to spread undemocratic and extremist ideology throughout pakistan. it is deplorable that she could not finish the battle against those elements. in a poignant twist of fate, she was stopped when common people were beginning to rally behind her to demilitarise country's politics and pave the way for democracy.
a step in the right direction
the all pervasive nature of corruption and the impunity culture growing around it have had a telling effect on the national economy, the traditional value system and the way politics and governance operated in the country. the society was taken over by an upstart money elite with their insatiable acquisitive lifestyle as the saner and cultural elements beat a retreat.
a tragedy born of military despotism and anarchy
even those of us sharply critical of benazir bhutto's behaviour and policies - both while she was in office and more recently - are stunned and angered by her death. indignation and fear stalk the country once again.
life reflecting her country's contradictions
with her luminous eyes and strong features framed by a flowing white head scarf, benazir bhutto was the face of pakistan's democratic hopes -- a face that had been thrust into the limelight with the execution of her father in 1979 and that remained there, aging gracefully, until her assassination in pakistan on thursday.

saarc folklore festival 2007: delhi part i
i landed in delhi on the afternoon of december 6 expecting it to be colder than dhaka. but surprisingly enough it was not and i felt somewhat discomfited at having packed so much warm clothes in my luggage. less space for books that i planned to buy, i thought a little sourly. we drove in a microbus through dry, dun-coloured delhi streets towards indira gandhi university campus. i had only just met my fellow bangladeshis, at delhi airport when we were being picked up by the event manager's representative. they were all academic folklorists here to read papers at the international folklore seminar and i, the journalist, distinctly felt the odd man out. but we soon became acquainted, exchanging small talk as we peered out of the microbus windows at dusty neem tree leaves scattered over a scrabble earth that looks desolate to bengalis born to the lush green velvet of their countryside. the party consisted of dr. shamsuzzaman khan ( ex dg of shilpakala academy), dr. mahbubul haque of chittagong university, dr. s. jamil ahmed of dhaka university's department of theatre and music, and professor muniruzzaman (retired) and his wife.

a woman unmasks the immorality of feudalism
mukhtar mai, also known as mukhtaran bibi, was subjected to gang rape in the village of meerwala in pakistan's punjab province on the recommendations of a village council in 2002. it was an incident as horrible in its perpetration as it was powerful in its ramifications. mukhtar bibi, like so many others before her in pakistan and elsewhere, could have opted for the traditional suicide after the shame that was heaped on her even as a whole village watched, tongue-tied, what was being done to her by men on the higher perches of feudalism in her country. no one lifted a finger, no one said a word, there was none to protest the scandalous behaviour of the mastoi tribe. mukhtar was only a gujar, a member of a community that had for ages been poor and therefore resigned to its fate, which again was what people like the mastois made of it.
