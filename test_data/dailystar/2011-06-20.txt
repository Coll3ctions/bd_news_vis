tidal sufferings

deepening uncertainty in me
forces loyal to syrian leader bashar al-assad have been shelling a small town near the border with turkey, forcing its residents to flee to safety on the other side. the operation demonstrates, four months into the unrest in syria, the brutality of the regime in trying to suppress the popular movement for political change. in libya, despite all the nato bombing to force muammar gaddafi from power, the regime, despite its weakened nature, remains in place. nato bombing has just resulted in more civilians dying, which raises the critical question of whether all this international pressure on gaddafi is yielding the results the west had earlier thought it would. meanwhile, in morocco, king muhammad's offer of reforms has left no one impressed. his detractors' argument that earlier reforms in the country's 400-year history have been superficial cannot be dismissed out of hand. yemen's ali abdullah saleh has fled to saudi arabia. view the page sports
