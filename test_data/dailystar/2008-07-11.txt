callous disregard for human life
the death of a poor farmer due to the utter negligence of the dmch is representative of the general slide in the dutifulness of the public service providers in the country. the unfortunate man died, having waited, not one, or two, but six long agonizing hours, for medical attention, which he did not get. a doctor did see him at last, but half an hour after he had passed away -- to pronounce him dead. one wonders whether one could find a better example to illustrate the miserable conditions of our government hospitals. this is an act of criminal negligence.
the hard realities before bimstec
the bimstec ministerial conference on poverty alleviation in the region is certainly a timely move. and it is so because of the very crucial issues which the region in particular and the world in general happen to be confronted with at the moment. the chief adviser has pointed to some of those issues. we may note that tackling those issues are important if the programme against poverty is to have any meaning. in this context, it would be well to recall the very reasons for which the bay of bengal initiative for multi-sectoral technical and economic cooperation (bimstec) was established in 1997; and of course those reasons are all self-explanatory. at a time when regional cooperation around the world on fundamental economic and political issues has become something of a norm, and necessarily so, it is only natural that bimstec too will be expected to throw up the results one desires of it.
suma's story
imagine for a moment what it is like to live your life in fear. you are 12 years old, studying in class seven, enjoying spending time with your school friends, watching your favourite soap operas and reality shows instead of doing homework, listening to new artists on the radio, slipping out of the house to spend time giggling and gossiping with your friends, pleading with your parents to buy you a mobile phone, your whole life ahead of you.
the weight of words
william shakespeare writes in romeo and juliet that if we call a rose by any other name, it would still smell as sweet. but is that true for words in the realm of language? if we fail to use the right word or write it in wrong spelling, would it still ring the same sweet meaning to a listener or reader? just think of one example. if you say "wart" and the doctor thinks "nose," would you care to ask him to remove a wart from your face?
politics and price of oil
world oil prices have risen by nearly 50% since the beginning of 2008, and nearly doubled over the past year. both economic and political factors have driven this unsettling rush in oil prices. however, some recently proposed remedial measures here in the us appear nonsensical. president george bush and presumptive republican presidential nominee john mccain both have recently proposed withdrawal of the 1990 federal moratorium on offshore oil drilling. view the page sports

nctb and some questions
on june 30, 2008 the daily prothom alo brought to light some gross and inexcusable mistakes in the textbooks published by the nctb for our school children. the same newspaper reported on july 01 that the honourable ca of the present ctg had taken the matter into cognisance and asked for explanation from the officials concerned. we hope that the matter will not end, like many other matters of the past, in paper correspondence only. this time we would like to see that the nctb is reformed to perform its sacred duty to the nation with full professionalism. for that i would like to submit some comments from my 38 years of formal experience as a teacher and as an educational administrator. before i put my comments it may not be out of context to briefly explain the functions of the nctb for the general readers of your daily.

women workers in saudi arabia
women workers in saudi are forcibly confined, exploited and abused by their employers. there are at least one million expatriate women working legally in some of the lowest-paid jobs in saudi arabia. the overwhelming majority of them are domestic workers in private households. others are employed as hairdressers, beauticians and maintenance staff in gender-segregated public and private facilities. in case of women workers, exploitative labour conditions such as workdays stretching to twelve hours or longer, unpaid salaries, denied benefits, and threats and intimidation from employers are common. employers demanded their passports when they arrived in the kingdom, and in most cases did not provide them with an official residency permit, the only document valid in saudi arabia for identification purposes. the evidence also demonstrates that many exploited women workers in saudi arabia suffer one gender-specific abuse: forced confinement.
