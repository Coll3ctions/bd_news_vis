karachi mayhem
we strongly condemn the suicide bomb attack on a procession of supporters of pakistan's former prime minister benazir bhutto in karachi that left at least 133 people dead and nearly 400 injured. it was a dastardly act orchestrated by some extremist elements who apparently wanted to display their crude strength at the very outset of her reaching home after spending over eight years in exile. in an instant reaction ms bhutto has pointed her finger at the failure of the intelligence agencies.
aiming high for exports
the government's export earning target for fiscal 2007-08 at us$ 14.5 billion envisages a 19.07 percent increase over last fiscal year's earning of us$ 12.17 billion. what is growth about unless every year we notch up higher earnings than the preceding year's level? true, but the point to note about this year's higher export target is the backdrop against which it is set: perceptible downturn in export earning was observed during the last three months of fiscal 2006-07. as a matter of fact, the new export year opens on a rather critical note with earnings in july plummeting by 21.08 percent. the downtrend in rmg sector, the mainstay of our export earnings, reflected far fewer orders received between december and march of last fiscal, the time-period marked by effects of political instability followed by massive labour unrest. as ill- luck would have it, warmer winter in the west led to a deficit in orders, too. there was underperformance in some other areas than garment such as frozen foods, leather, ceramics, jute goods and engineering products.
international concern over myanmar
the special representative of the un secretary general mr. ibrahim gambari has briefed the united nations security council after his return from myanmar. mr. gambari has stated that during his visit, he had conveyed the anxiety of the international community to the senior generals of the myanmar army led government and also to the detained nobel laureate opposition leader aung san suu kyi. in this context he particularly singled out the united nations' concern over reports of night-time raids, arbitrary arrests, mass relocations and beatings being committed by security and non-uniformed elements.
the other dimension of police management
although a police organisation appears as an archetypal legal-rational bureaucracy in the weberian mould, in practice policy is formulated and implemented with a characteristic lack of attention to the precepts of rationality. as such, it is not unusual to see that police organisations of different societies, bangladesh inclusive, find themselves committed to achieving the impossible.
terrorism rearing its head
it must be a coincidence. otherwise, why would the terrorists choose october 11, the birthday of gandhian jaya prakash narayan, to strike when people have forgotten him? even at patna where his protégé, nitish kumar, is the bihar chief minister, there was no official function, much less a public holiday. the terrorists who attacked the dargah at ajmer are hardly concerned with narayan's message of peace and non-violence. they have their own cult of bomb and their own dogma of fundamentalism. their purpose was to instill fear. more than that, it was meant to convey hostility to the composite culture which the dargah represented. a study done a few years ago showed that the number of non-muslims visiting the place was more than that of muslims. view the page sports

durga puja: the social and religious aspects
durga puja 'worship of divine mother' the festival of pomp and power -- is the greatest socio-religious extravaganza of the bengali hindus and by now it has become a global celebration witnessed in almost all the major cities of the world, from new york to los angles, from london to belfast, from durban to tokyo. it is a mixture of spiritual sublimity and enlivened sociability that gives it a multi-dimensional excellence. the exquisite beauty of the pratima (idol), splendidly decorated by artistic skill and colourful devotional outfit adds additional grandeur to the whole spectrum of jubilation and enlightenment. bengali culture and bengali literature indeed owe a lot to this prodigious socio-cultural fanfare and nostalgic articulations.
the hindu vision of divine mother
civilization is in a state of transition. the transition that we have to effect today, if we are to survive, is a moral and spiritual revolution which should embrace our whole existence. in this context, a penetrating thought and look into the totality of the blessing of mother durga acts as a salvation. the vedas, the ancient holy scriptures of the world, uphold the truth of eternal existence of the divine mother as the supreme power.
when shall we get rid of dhaka city traffic jam?
with a huge fleet of cars, buses and all other types of vehicles gridlocked near a rail gate or road intersection sometimes even for 30 minutes at a stretch, dhaka city's traffic congestion problem has assumed an alarming proportion. people are afraid to get out of their houses because the journey from home to office or business centre takes away the vital hours that he could devote to his work. other than being late in the offices, work places or on any scheduled appointments, mental disgust, exhaustion and loss of effective man hours is a colossal drain on the resources of the whole country. the road scene in dhaka is something awesome especially at important crossings like bishwa road, mohakhali-tejgaon, panthapath-bijoy sarani, sonargaon hotel crossing linking tejgaon industrial area and farmgate crossing, hatirpool, new market, gulistan, bangladesh bank and hatkhola crossing near the ittefaq office. view the page literature
memories of durga puja
the very first time i heard shah abdul karim's heart-stirring song, “age ki shundor din kataitam” i was transported to my childhood years in dhaka's ramkrishna mission road and the durga puja days we used to revel in then. karim remembers lyrically “how happily” he and other village youths would spend their childhood days, “hindus and muslims /singing baul and ghetu songs all together.” karim's song always strikes a responsive note in my heart because i recall how joyously my friends -- whether muslim or hindu -- and my family members would spend the puja days every year in our ramkrishna misson road para or neighbourhood. although my memories of those days have dimmed considerably by now, one thing i still remember clearly is this: after the two eids, durga puja was the most important festival to light up our young lives then. alas, those days are gone, not only for me, but for most people growing up in a para in dhaka.

playing the blame game
policy of blaming bangladesh for every terrorist attacks in india are doing more harm than good. at least 42 people have been killed and 50 injured in two explosions at a crowded park and a popular eatery in hyderabad on 25th august '07, three months after the mecca masjid blasts. soon after the incident, union minister of state for home sriprakash jaiswal had said, "some of our neighbours are jealous of india's progress and they keep hatching conspiracies to disrupt harmony in the country." indian newspapers are blaming it on weak-kneed and bumbling response to terror attacks, both in preventing them and in bringing the merchants of death to book and the failure of the governments to deal more firmly with the scourge of terrorism. what we have observed is that a familiar drill follows every terror attack in india - visits to the spot by some high-level dignitaries and then announcement of compensation and finger pointing across the border towards pakistan and bangladesh.
tackling corruption
to tackle corruption one has to have a clear understanding of the various dimensions of corruption. corruption can be of various types with varying impacts on any given society. material corruption like illegal acquisition of money and assets through the use of one's position and authority is perhaps easier to deal with than corruption having moral and ethical dimensions.
the economic factors behind the myanmar protests
the first sign of the current protests currently underway in myanmar occurred in a rare display of public outrage over the economic conditions within the country in february 2007. a small group calling themselves the myanmar development committee called on the military rulers to address consumer prices, lack of health care, education and the poor electricity infrastructure. normally unseen in myanmar, the protest was quickly broken up after only 30 minutes of activity. likely in response to the protests, the ruling military junta appointed brigadier-general than han of the myanmar police to the responsibility of handling civil unrest in rangoon. view the page star books review
snippets about bangladesh's history and culture
surely, it would be expecting too much for one to gain a detailed, profound and comprehensive account of the history, culture, and heritage of bangladesh in an anthology of around 450 pages. the saving grace of the book under review, on this count, lies in its very subtitle: “an introductory reader”. in the preface to the book, the editors, a.f. salahuddin ahmed and bazlul mobin chowdhury, articulate its modest objective: “this book aims at giving the general reader an overview of the different aspects of history, society and culture of bangladesh…. though meant as a textbook for students, general readers may also find it useful.” the general reader would find bangladesh national culture and heritage: an introductory reader a tad more than useful. at the very least, s/he should find it a handy point of reference for diverse issues relating to this country's history, culture and society.
the oriya voice in sarojini sahoo
certainly it can be considered a good piece of news for readers of literature in bangladesh that a worthy translation of a novel by a noted fictionist of orissa has come out very recently from a local publishing house. the novel mithya gerosthali, set in a very familiar context, is able to draw the attention of many for both its loftiness and its lucidity of language.
