no one belonging to me

that, even in daylight, can be indiscreet
and trace your torso's outline and dare

when people rise from cheese
songs, but the bloody revolution goes unnoticed
august is a ruthless bow
the vicious son walks out of the farmhouse
bringing with him tobacco and a dry throat
the beasts must bear cruel blinders
corpses encrusted in hair hang
from the swollen drums of their buttocks
till the sacrifices behind the fence
become blurry
from far away there comes marching a troop
of smoking people
lights
the car whispers down
the hill road.
its lights gouge out

hollow of
brightness
one evening in a café
when thoughts don't take you far
and you sit silent
tremulous
staring at the veins in your hands;
when the chariot of your imagination
won't carry you to passageways lit with glimmers of insight
and you sit silent
tremulous
gazing at the smoke encircling your wrist:
when you do not answer the woman who greets you
as she lets her shawl fall
into the vacuum of the evening
and you sit silent
tremulous
staring at the fateful events written in your coffee grounds;
when the new émigrés stroll by
arm-in-arm with their adorned ladies
chattering on about how time flies
and you sit silent
tremulous
gazing at the mysterious wood of the table;
when you don't keep anyone's company
and can remember nothing of the war
but a horseshoe
or bullet holes in a curtain;
when, one evening in a café
faces pass before you like a copper fog
and you hear cymbals clashing in a distant desert
or walls crashing into hypothetical canals;
when, one evening in a café
that blind singer's album
starts to play,
and everyone suddenly sighs;
then you rise and walk
to where the hatchet
leans against the tree. view the page star health
fissures in updated national health policy
the ministry of health and family welfare has published the final draft of revised national health policy (nhp) on its website recently. after its first introduction in 2000, certain programmes like sector wide approach (swa), adoption of essential services package (esp) were reviewed for necessary changes and an updated draft was prepared in 2006 to incorporate the changes in programmes and approach; but it was not finalised. along with mentioned sectors, different issues have come into the discussion but all were not included or prioritised accordingly during the recent process of updating nhp by current caretaker government.

good asthma control in pregnancy important

abc of kidney transplantation
kidney transplantation means replacement of a diseased or missing kidney or failed kidney with a healthy kidney from another person, called ‘donor’. it is an operation also known as renal transplant (renal is another word for kidney). people who receive a transplant must take medication and be monitored by a physician who specialises in kidney disease, known as nephrologist.
fit and fat: study shows it is possible
it may be possible to be both fat and healthy, researchers reported recently. at least half of overweight adults, and close to a third of obese men and women, have normal blood pressure, cholesterol and other measures of heart health. and being lean does not necessarily protect people, either.
the realm of health myths
it's ok to skip breakfast
breakfast is a very important meal. when we are sleeping, we are also fasting for an average of about eight hours, so it is essential to break this fast. although people who skip breakfast catch up on their energy requirements later in the day, they are unlikely to get all the vitamins and minerals that a simple breakfast can provide. try porridge with honey for a wholesome but filling meal. or you can go for oats, or if you are running out of time you can try ready-to-eat fortified breakfast cereals.

border attacks: impact on pak-us coalition against terror
the cross border ground attack from afghanistan into pakistan's tribal north west on september 3rd by helicopters involving commandos of the us special operations forces to hunt down taliban and al qaeda in their sanctuaries without pakistan government's knowledge has placed us-pakistan coalition to fight terror under serious stress. it came three days before asif ali zardari was elected president and was the main subject at his first press conference where journalists cornered him for his innocuous reaction on the attack. the us attack could not have come at a worse moment for zardari who has a tainted image and little political experience and badly needs to create an image that he is not a us lapdog. it was left to general ashfaq pervez kayani, chief of army staff to take the strongest stand against the us action, calling it a threat to pakistan's sovereignty that would be met at any cost.
india needs to change its foreign policy to be a global power
the 21st century arrived only eight years ago. there is no zero sum game in global power. if one rises the other falls.
search for a new doctrine
washington had confessed that there was nothing like al qaeda or wmd in iraq during saddam's time: occupation has invited al qaeda for a killing feast. seven years of pounding on possible and suspected al qaeda connections has led to nowhere. the elusive bin laden and his terror outfit are still expanding from their hideouts. 'either with us or against us' had forced pakistan to be a reluctant partner and anti-american feeling is intense among the people of pakistan today. frequent bombing from north africa to philippine, in europe and elsewhere tell, bush doctrine is neither working in the front nor taking the people along. there should be a search for a new strategy that will keep people engaged not by force or threat but by shared values and gains. the new doctrine must make nations partners, not the collaborators of the strategy. view the page star books review
memoirs frank and free of prejudice
autobiographies are mostly written by people in powerful positions either to defend themselves from criticism or misconceptions about their work while in power, or to elucidate some good work not adequately appreciated or slurred over. here, however, is an autobiography written by an astute, efficient and honest civil service officer, who at one time had been principal secretary in the powerful prime minister's office (pmo), attached to two great slain prime ministers, indira and her son rajiv gandhi.
the long, hard journey yet goes on
overall development of a country cannot take place without the participation of its female work force. at a time when climate change and the role of forestation are the top agenda for nations across the globe, we cannot overlook the role of women in social forestry. tahsina akhter comprehends the dire need of national economic development by means of taking up the issue of poverty alleviation and the role of women in social forestry. this book delves deep into the issue, examining the role of social forestry in reducing the poverty of women in the rural areas of the country.
the hindu widow and those mystifying compromises
a bookmark that i have states, “never judge a book by its movie”. i think it is particularly apt for bapsi sidhwa's novel water as it is based on the movie. movies are based on books but this one's the other way round. the author was asked to write the novel in ninety days to coincide with the release of the movie. the story is dated 1938, with gandhi's ahimsa movement gathering momentum.
what is civil society?
civil society. the term has now been around for a few decades, largely since the 1980s. some sociologists and political scientists coined the term here in bangladesh. the thought of civil society mainly originated, however, in the eighteenth century in western europe. but why and wherefore civil society in bangladesh?
