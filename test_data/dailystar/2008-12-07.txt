disqualification facing parliamentary nominees
one cannot but be amazed at the large number of parliamentary candidates facing disqualification at the general elections later this month owing to their defaulting on bank loans and non-clearance of utility bills. these individuals belong to all the major parties, namely, the awami league, the bangladesh nationalist party, the jatiya party and the jamaat-e-islami. what boggles the mind even more is that despite the government's having thrice relaxed the rpo in respect of a repayment or rescheduling of loan repayment and clearing utility bills, these parties went ahead with nominating such a large number of candidates -- 130 to be precise -- for the jatiya sangsad elections. it is common wisdom that given the nature of parliament as the focal point of all politics and as the symbolism of morality, the political parties will nominate for it candidates of impeccable reputation. that they did not do so, that indeed they pressurised the authorities thrice to have the relevant provisions amended, is one more reminder of why politics has been taking a beating in this country.

terrorism in mumbai
the mindless massacre in mumbai defies any explanation that would be acceptable to reason. under any law of war, india would have the right to get its pound of flesh only if such an action had not been so costly to all parties concerned. according to the us national counter-terrorism center, in 2007 india had the second largest number of casualties, after iraq, from terrorism. view the page sports

religious extremism
i was greatly shocked to see the news that hundreds of religious extremists had vandalized the sculpture 'balaka".
voters' rights
there is a debate whether the activities of the caretaker government and the emergency rule are acceptable to the people of the country or not. but there is no doubt that the mass people want change in every sphere of life whether it is institutional or non-institutional. just for this people have waited for a period of two years sacrificing lots of things. but we never hope the change will come only from the commitment of one group of people, or one organisation or one community. for ensuring the change, a complete and comprehensive participation of all people of the country is necessary. and the lawmakers of the country should play the main role.
protect national identity
the militants are active again, and out to destroy our heritage and culture. this government is too soft on the religious fundamentalists. i am very concerned about the protection of our 3 historic monuments. these are : 1. shaheed minar 2. jatiya smiriti saudha 3. aparajeyo bangla. we want to know very clearly from this government what kind of security protections are in place to protect and preserve these these national historic monuments. i have very little confidence in the dhaka university authorities to provide due protection to two of those historic monuments. the du itself is well divided on ideological lines and carrying flags of different colours not friendly to our secular culture.
electricity generation
when the world is facing tremendous shortfall in fossil fuel supply and when the world is concerned about saving itself from the green house effect and billions of dollars are spent for keeping the world safe and habitable, as a third world underdeveloped country we often chop down trees, burn kerosene for cooking etc. why don't we consider building an offshore power plant in the shallow waters of the bay of bengal. this could be the wind based power plant, which most of the eastern european countries are using these days to generate electricity.
elections
the upcoming election schedule has been declared to ensure proper democracy in our country. all political parties have the equal opportunity to show their dedication and worth for the real goodness of the country & countrymen. in the recent past, we observed many unwise & evil acts by the governments who were in power.
mumbai carnage
in terms of death it was not the biggest but in planning and execution it was the most horrific one. death of so many innocent people in such a cowardly attack is not only a condemnable act, rather a brutal atrocity on humanity. the whole world condemned the attack. we here in bangladesh join the condemnation with the sincerest feelings for the innocent victims. such incidents should never occur anywhere in the world.
tajuddin ahmed

religion of peace
how many times the muslim scholars had to reiterate that islam is a religion of peace after each and every terror attack that drew international attention. nowadays it seems to be a monotonous and defensive monologue from one group of people to the rest of the world.
raffle draw?
a few days before the eid-ul-fitr, 2008 i bought a few items from a very well known shopping mall and almost inevitably was endowed with some raffle coupons. being cautious enough, i carefully scrutinized the date of the draw. it was 2nd week of november 2008. so, i opened the web address they provided with the coupon and found no results there. having the feeling of being cheated, i sent an sms to the address and got an instant reply. it says: “sorry! your respective coupon number does not match with the results of the draw.”
politicians in jail
several hundred politicians and other professionals were sent to jail after 1/11. they are now released on bail and some are still in jail on various charges like corruption and graft. a good percentage of politicians and others who were in jail are taking part in election being nominated by the respective party or individually.
is it enough?
i am a bangladeshi american, a registered democrat. i voted for barack obama in our presidential election. but i always keep track of my beloved bangladesh. i am fortunate to watch popular bangladeshi television channels, despite being in the us and therefore i get all news right away. recently, two former prime ministers and the leaders of the two main political parties talked with each other, smiled at each other. this event has drawn a huge interest in bangladesh, the tv channels were very much ecstatic. perhaps, it is good that at least these two leaders talked with each other when most expect them to avoid each other. but did the nation accomplish anything after the so much publicized brief conversation between the two leaders? barring any miracles, one of them will be the next prime minister and the other one will be the leader of the opposition. thus the whole nation's hope rests on these leaders. it would be very encouraging, if both go out of their way and prepare a joint statement in which they would declare unequivocally:
fathers' choice!
very recently a new business front has been opened in bangladesh. the name of this new business is "marriage counselling" in bangla we call it ghatokali. now there are many offices in dhaka city. i know a distant friend of mine who has opened an office in dhaka recently. he explained very shortly over phone some experiences he had during the last few months in this business.
concrete jungle
i want to share a very sad story with all of you. every morning on my walks i come across a bunch of monkeys. the first day i saw one of them and was quite surprised as to how they survive in this overcrowded polluted and unfriendly city. then i realized if we could why not them. there was a particular family of mother and baby that became familiar to me. i noticed them most regularly. i began to wonder about their lives and sometime when i saw two groups fighting and chasing each other across the street, i would wonder about the welfare of this particular family. the baby would hold on to the mother very tightly as they crossed the big road and jump up the wall to climb the big tree. it was an amazing sight and gave me a feeling of loneliness in the concrete jungle we live in.
