gross mishandling of melamine issue
well over a month since its appearance, the melamine scare refuses to die down. in fact, it's being propelled to a heightening state with each passing day -- thanks to a totally confused handling of the issue and an evasive approach taken to it. basically, one gets the impression of deliberate waffling in taking a clear-cut decision about the public health hazard, with import and business considerations getting the better of public health concern, especially that of our children.
india aims for the moon
we take this opportunity to congratulate the people and government of india on the launch of the chandrayaan 1 mission to the moon. one hardly needs any telling that, for a developing country like india and indeed for the region, the venture is cause for justifiable pride. that sense of pride as well as belonging is enhanced by the fact that india is an important component of saarc. as a fellow member of the south asian regional organisation, we feel that the stride delhi has taken in space will have a positive impact on scientific development for indians in particular and for their neighbours and for developing countries in general. the launch of the lunar mission is, briefly, one very powerful sign of the advances in technology that india has been making in recent years. it is at the same time a broad hint that where the exploration of space is concerned, the indians have finally come of age.
autumn harvest
one of the occupational hazards of being an assistant editor is that you don't get out from behind your desk to go out into the field nearly as much as you should. so when the chairman of research initiatives bangladesh, dr. shamsul bari, invited me and daily star photographer amirul rajiv to come with him to nilphamari to see first hand how the people from northern bangladesh are working to make monga a thing of the past, we didn't need to be asked twice.

bangladesh can do it!
the cricket lovers witnessed the onslaught of shakib al hasan in the first test match between bangladesh and new zealand at chittagong. shakib mesmerized the kiwis with his devastating left arm spin bowling by taking seven kiwi wickets for just 36 runs. it was a superb performance by this twenty-one year old bangladeshi. it seemed the chittagong pitch simply fitted him like a glove. shakib is a talented player and our “so called” cricket board should nurture talents like him. he was not only good in his bowling but also thrived well in the second innings, scoring 71 runs and boosted a healthy total for the kiwis to chase.
acc
thanks to the chairman of the acc for being frank , and also for admitting its limitations. i do not expect any miracle from the acc to combat corruption in bangladesh. my expectation is that the reformed acc shall perform most efficiently to prevent political corruption by adopting very stringent rules and regulations, rather than running after the politicians and hooking them under the law. because of politicisation of the whole process, from inquiry to the door of the judiciary, the acc has to concede defeat in their approach.
accommodation problem at sust
we feel proud of being students of the country's first science & technology university - shahjalal university of science & technology. it was established in 1991 and now it is 17 years old . there are about 9,000 students here. but it is a matter of regret for us that there are only three halls which are insufficient for accommodating such a large number of students.
exploited students
university is the supreme educational institution of our country but it is also a place for spoiling the students due to active politics on the campus.
matia chowdhury's interview
it is very easy to demand noble things from others. mrs. matia chowdhury said in that interview (october 16) that she wants a free, fair and credible election in an environment free from fear, apprehension and criminal activities. i totally agree with begum matia chowdhury and that is precisely why the next general election must be held under the supervision of the caretaker administration, with a relaxed state of emergency. all previous records show that during al/bnp rules elections were rigged, voters were intimidated and even denied entry. people didn't feel safe to go to polling stations during the al/bnp rules.
tortured maids
my focus in this letter is not on the occasional news headlines on torture of household assistants. what i refer to is the silent unseen tortures (physical & verbal) of poor victims who come to the cities. i was taken aback by a particular incident a few months back when i found a dignified and respected lady physically abusing her support staff over trifling matters. it was even shocking for me as i knew she was one of those who even worked for the humanitarian missions and often identified for her philanthropic contributions to society. surely, i was prompted by this incident to write but i understand the level of mass torture going on throughout the socio demographical classes of urban life.
"baul" statues
the statues of several "bauls" or traditional bengali singers were demolished from their building place, in front of the main entrance to zia international airport. the government has also decided not to go ahead with their construction. i applaud the government's decision aimed at preserving calm.

communal violence
undoubtedly everybody wants to live in peace. nobody wants to live amidst violence. but sometimes due to our misunderstandings such violence escalates.
right to life
contrary to the world's political pundits' notions, the most important issue facing humanity in the upcoming us election is the fundamental "right to life" of every human being.
financial crisis
in british newspapers of october 14 it is revealed that bonuses in the city of london financial institutions last year ( 2007) amounted to £17 billion pounds. you can quite easily multiply this by ten for such institutions in the usa, continental europe, japan, hong kong, singapore etc. so £170 billion pounds were siphoned off by the fat cats over just one year by a conservative estimate. if this had gone on for the last ten years, £1.7 trillion pounds have been creamed off which is about the same amount now required to be paid off by the ordinary taxpayer of each country to stave off a complete meltdown of the western style capitalist system.
boat race in gopalganj
i really appreciate and welcome channel-i's initiative to cover the traditional boat race of gopalganj. this boat race is a heritage of that area but unfortunately we, the youngsters of today's bangladesh, do not know about all these traditions as there is a lack of interest and focus in our culture and heritage. this responsibility goes to our television channels also as there is a common trend of blending western flavour or indian style in various programmes.
nuke culture
talk shows on diverse issues hosted by mr. hamid mir and mr. kamran khan on geo tv in the recent times - i mean, up to and including yesterday, 14th day of october 2008 - are, in an average sense and as appropriate - found to be well focused on pakistan's competing priorities; competitive in terms of time, space, and outcome related potentials; civil at inter-human levels; well researched; well presented; and antidote seekers when it comes to fighting diseases of in-country and ex-country origins at political, non-political and other levels. well done!
election and foreigners
thanks to mr s. mahmood, a senior journalist, for his very appropriate analysis regarding the role of foreign envoys in dealing with the internal affairs of bangladesh, especially the crucial general election.
women as objects
women are frequently objectified in the media. media often objectifies women, portrays women as physical objects that can be looked at-- and fail to portray women as subjective beings with thoughts, histories, and emotions. in reality, human beings are both objects as subjects, as they are physical collections of molecules as well as individuals. to objectify someone, then, is to reduce someone exclusively to the level of object.
low literacy rate
chief adviser dr. fakhruddin ahmed expressed his concern in a meeting held in september about the low rate of literacy. actually the literacy rate of our country is lower than many other countries in the world. but every problem has a solution. we know that our three-fourth border areas are surrounded by land.
why can't we do anything?
we got a chance to visit new delhi during our visit to india. i would like to mention here that new delhi is almost connected from one end to the other by metro rail (surface as well as underground). the total system is well maintained and people are commuting as per their needs.
reducing traffic congestion
dhaka, the capital of bangladesh, is a small and unplanned city crammed with a prodigious number of people. the excessive number of people requires an excessive number of transports. the traffic congestion resulting from excessive number of vehicles; especially private cars , illegal parking, occupation of roads and pavements by hawkers, unwillingness of reckless drivers to abide by traffic rules and so on has been a nagging and intractable problem in everyday life of city dwellers. the sufferings and miseries of the commuters, passengers and travellers resulting from suffocating traffic stalemates have gone beyond tolerable limits. besides, traffic congestion is causing immense loss of valuable working hours of the people. so, the government should immediately come forward with pragmatic and substantive solutions to address the nagging problem. the government should ask the authorities concerned to be strict and unflagging enough to make the people and vehicle-drivers abide by the traffic rules, to stop illegal parking, to stop picking up passengers here and there, to stop unfit vehicles from plying, to resist trucks from entering into the city before 9:00pm, to restrict and, if needed, ban the movement of rickshaws on the roads where buses are available to smoothen the traffic movements. exemplary punishment along with substantial fines should be meted out to those who flout and recklessly break traffic rules. the government should impose a significant amount of tax on private car imports and on road permits. the number of double-decker buses that can accommodate many passengers at a time and local buses should be increased to reduce the magnitude of the problem. the people should be encouraged to walk small distance instead of riding rickshaws on the way where buses regularly ply. more consciousness about traffic rules should be raised among the people. the government should also ask the school authorities to make arrangements and to run school-vans and school-buses for the safe transportation of the school-children and to assure the guardians of their safe transportation and to stop them from waiting on the roads for their children with cars causing serious tailback. view the page international
