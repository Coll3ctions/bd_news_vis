missing bdr arms
it is worrisome indeed that the law enforcing agencies of the country have yet to make a full assessment of the number and types of firearms that are missing from the bdr armoury since 25 february. we infer from various reports that a large number of weapons of various descriptions have been taken away by fleeing bdr personnel and their cohorts after perpetrating the carnage inside pilkhana. and it is most disconcerting that there is no clue as to whether these looted arms and ammunition remain abandoned in some remote places or have already been sold to anti-social elements.
bashundahara city inferno
the sight of a huge fire engulfing the top floors of the bashundahara city shopping and office complex, a structure of iconic features in the heart of the metropolis, evoked fear in the minds of the beholders. holiday shoppers could hardly believe something like this could happen to a modern building supposedly fitted with gadgets to detect smoke and douse out fire at the very outset. they were caught unawares in the shops and food-courts as the blaze spread quickly in the top floors of the office tower but were helped by security personnel to come out safely. as a high wind fanned the fire, falling debris from the top floors posed threat to life of onlookers on the streets below, as fire fighters looked on helplessly. the domineering height of the 20-storied structure made it impossible for them to reach the source of fire with water guns. at the time of writing this editorial (6:30 pm), one person was reported to have lost his life and many others received injuries of various degrees.

protest, not rebellion
comparisons are odious. yet nawaz sharif has made the same call to rebel against president asif ali zardari government as gandhian jayaprakash narain had done in 1975. he too, like nawaz sharif, had asked policemen not to obey "illegal and unconstitutional" orders. mrs indira gandhi then imposed the emergency, gagged the press and detained more than 100,000 people without trial. two years later, when elections were held, she was routed. nawaz sharif is, however, talking about the 1971 situation when east pakistan, now bangladesh, seceded from pakistan. the situation is, indeed, somber because the long march of the lawyers already has nawaz sharif, his muslim league and others participating in it.
the lepers act 1898 needs to be repealed
there is an act passed by the then british-india government in the year 1898 called 'the lepers act 1898'. this was meant to control and deal with the people who were suffering from the disease called 'leprosy'. this was preceded by the leper act 1895. all these were prejudicial to the human rights of the people affected by the stigmatizing disease. they were meant for the segregation and ancient unscientific treatment of “pauper lepers” and to prohibit them from following certain callings or trades. view the page sports

india's steepest defence budget hike ever
on 15th of february 2009, india announced her defence budget for the financial year 2008-09 for rs.1,056 billion estimated roughly at about us $ 26.6 billion to fund a mammoth modernisation programme for the 4th largest military of the world. although this hike is about 10% compared to india's budget for 2007-08 but this is the steepest hike of indian defence budget since the partition of the subcontinent. this boosting of expenditure has been justified due to crossing of a threshold and deterioration of security environment and increased defence spending by china. the budget looks impressive despite the effects of global economic slowdown and it marks an increase of nearly 125% percent over the last one decade from rs. 47,071 crores in 1999-2000. indian defence analysts feel that to meet any threats to its vital interests india requires among others, a strong military capability that could safeguard its interests within and outside domestic boundaries including in the vast seas that account for 70% per cent of the country's total trade by value. china has also increased its defence budget to about us $70 billion, which some observers point out that the real expenditure is much more than the announced budget. point to note that bangladesh's total national budget for the year 2008-09 was only tk. 999.62 billion.
