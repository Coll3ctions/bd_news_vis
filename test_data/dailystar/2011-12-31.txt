delivering effective climate finance
responding to climate change requires urgent steps to prepare for climate related disasters, protect social and natural systems, arrest and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and restructure economies towards activities with low carbon footprints. the marginal cost of this transition and trade-off with growth and development are key issues that developing countries are dealing with. in developing countries, the estimated cost of additional investments to finance mitigation and adaptation efforts are estimated to be us$100 billion per year by 2020.
flood management: reducing vulnerability

she walked softly by . . .
razia khan amin was the one of the first teachers who enlightened us at dhaka university on english literature. that was early in october 1975, barely two months into a situation where bangladesh teetered on the brink of chaos. bangabandhu had been assassinated and we who had entered university suddenly found ourselves in conditions where the country was on a steep slide to regression. on that first day, apart from speaking to us of literature, razia khan amin reflected on the violent political change that had taken place. neither she nor we had any way of knowing on that october morning that our national tragedy had just begun. in a month's time, the leading lights of the mujibnagar government would be dead. some of the bravest of our war heroes --- khaled musharraf, shamsul huda, atm haider --- would die too in a country they had fought so hard, and so successfully, to liberate.
seeing with the heart
about seven years ago, when eid-ul-fitr came quite close to christmas, and it was interesting to observe the joy of festivities with family and friends and the giving and receiving of gifts. the giving is, of course, related to 'zakat' by which, as i understand, 2.5% of one's 'disposable income' (e.g. cash, savings and jewellery) should be given away, once a year, to the extreme poor and orphans. as a foreigner living and working in bangladesh, i see similarities between eid and christmas, such as the family coming together at a special time of the year, special foods, the joy of giving and remembering those who have very little. my work in 2004 was connected with assisting the very poorest in a government project, adarsha gram, which was assisted by the european union and provided houses, homesteads and livelihoods to homeless and landless families, particularly those who have lost their homes through river erosion. despite the many administrative and bureaucratic difficulties in managing such a project, the experience is enriching as well as humbling. i continue to work with the same category of extreme poor people with the dfid and ausaid supported chars livelihoods programme in the north west of the country.
reading short stories
a few weeks ago, i received a call from manishadi. it was a sunday evening and i was absorbed in the popular reality show “the amazing race”. i picked up the receiver and squinted to read the caller id. manishadi does not call me often, so i was pleasantly surprised to see her name on the caller id. as the phone rang for the fourth time, i hastily pressed the on the headset before the answering machine could kick in. it was manishdi indeed, and after pleasantries, she invited me to a literary event which she informed me was taking place for the first time in boston: an afternoon of bangla short story reading, or chhoto golpo dibash as it was to be called. view the page star health
a key strategy to save newborn

the arab spring: a year later
it was on december 17, 2010 when a tunisian street vendor, mohamed bouazizi, had set himself ablaze protesting against harassment by the local authorities. the incident soon led to a nation-wide protest in tunisia, and subsequently engulfed neighbouring arab countries in parts of west asia and north africa. the arab world has since witnessed a number of remarkable developments, significant among them being the overthrow of four long serving dictators: zine el abidine ben ali of tunisia, hosni mubarak of egypt, muammar gaddafi of libya and ali abdullah saleh of yemen. the events leading to the overthrow of these leaders were marked by protracted street protests, often leading to casualties and severe injuries among the protestors.

a country in existential struggle
i must confess i had felt as much drawn as repelled when i first set my eyes on the book. the massive volume with 560 odd pages even in paperback and 481 solid reading materials without notes, appendices and a not-too-short list of books consulted is, no doubt, intimidating. added to this was the mental list of a considerable number of books i already have read on different facets of life, living, history and on many other aspects of the countries of the sub-continent. but the desire to know and understand the people of the region ever more thoroughly, especially of pakistan in the wake of the threatening rise and expansion of religious fundamentalism there ultimately made me go for the book. and i must put on record my deep sense of happiness at having read it.
