the jatiya sangsad brought low
the bedlam into which parliament descended on monday has left the nation deeply embarrassed. and that is only natural, for like any other society around the world, we expect our legislature to be the repository of our hopes and our aspirations and all our dreams about the future. we expect, as people in other nations expect of their lawmakers, that the men and women we send to the jatiya sangsad to speak for us will rise above self, above party, above vitriolics through prioritising the myriad issues we face in our poverty-driven society. there are some particular reasons why, especially where the present js is concerned, our expectations are a lot bigger and higher than on previous occasions. suffice it to say, for now, that the present js is the outcome of a concerted struggle on our part for a return to a meaningful and decent democratic political order after the chaos and the near slide into anarchy that was only prevented through the imposition of a state of emergency in january 2007.
a step in the right direction
it is good to see the government taking note of an environmental concern aired through a report in this paper followed by an editorial over clearances given for industries to be set up in bhawal national park in breach of existing laws. what is more to the point is that the government has reacted promptly to the protestations by reimposing the ban on establishing industries or erecting other structures on 2500acres of private lands inside the national park.
isn't it time to govern?
advisor mashiur rahman has reasons to think anarchy is abroad in the land, that those behind it are on a mission to destabilise the government as well as the country. we do not disagree with him. in a land where for the better part of its independent existence conspiratorial politics has been the norm, it would be na√Øve to expect that those who have so long wielded authority and who today are outside the pale of power will rest easy in their discomfort. not after the execution of five of bangabandhu's assassins can you expect that those who patronised them for as long as twenty one years, maybe more than that stretch of time, will be happy at this remarkable opportunity for us to return to rule of law.

over population
bangladesh is a small but the highest populated country in the world. more than 15 crore people live here and 1.5 crore in dhaka city. it seems that every day is a 'haat' day in dhaka.

‚Äúterribly terrified‚Äù tony
ap's london headline news, published in most local english dailies on 30th january, was about tony blair's lame excuse for the illegal attack on iraq! it was a case of putting up fabricated reasons for justifying the attack, while there was no wmd (weapon of mass destruction) anywhere in iraq! the whole affair was the result of sinister reasoning manufactured by two "b" grade leaders, bush and blair.they have engineered the killing of thousands of innocent iraqi women, children and elderly civilians; possibly more than the civilians killed by uk & usa in world war ii.
islamophobia!
the unending burqa controversy deserves a thorough study about the subject. geerth wilders, an anti-islam protagonist, has clearly stated that he has problems with islam. like him, many have problems with islam. the fear of burqa, minarets, quranic verses, beards and anything related to islam is nothing but a symptom of islamophobia. another factor which contributed to this fear is that islam is spreading faster than any other religion.

science education

low net speed
three mobile operators now provide internet services. but the net speed is not as good as expected. on cu campus there are nine residential halls and approximately four thousand students live there. almost all the students use internet.
health cadre anomaly
i have been working at the health directorate for the last 19 years. i started my career in an international organisation and then i joined the bcs health cadre. during this long 19 years, i found a number of idle service rules. the most debatable one is senior scale exam. during the bnp regime, they exempted the health officials from departmental examination and foundation training for confirmation of the job up to 10th bcs, and this time, those who got the auto-confirmation are going to get a promotion without appearing in the senior scale exam. this is quite bizarre that the ministry is not asking for their exam documents.
a role model
rabeya is a poor physically challenged woman in her twenties. she lost her feet in an accident. she could take to begging but her self-respect did not allow her to do so. she managed to have a sewing machine and has been sewing clothes alongside the wall of the banani jaam-e-masjid. she does the sewing relatively at a cheaper rate than those done in established and posh shops. she thus helps herself and others.

what can i do?
it was 20 august thirteen years back. we came from riyadh to spend 45 days here. i saw my husband distributing chocolates to everyone in my in-laws' house. he looked very happy. he told his beloved mother that he was tired of living abroad and this time he would stay back.
a tragic death
i am trying to write something with a dampened heart. my heart is dampened but my wrath gushes forth. every death is heart-rending but deaths caused by fellow human-shaped animals are thousand times more so. one soul has just passed away. his soul is just out of his body but it is intact. it is intact to curse us, curse all the people of this country forever. we are all responsible for this death. we are all active participants in this murder. neither i, nor anyone else, can shrug off the responsibility of this heinous homicide.
rape victim
i am writing to you after reading a story reported in the daily star on 24 january 2010 about the case of a 16 year old girl who was lashed 101 times after becoming pregnant through being raped. i work for equality now, an international women's rights organisations that works on violence and discrimination against women and girls all over the world. we are a not-for- profit charity organisation and take no funding from any government. your report mentioned that a human rights organisation, led by a lawyer has raised the case. we are planning a visit to bangladesh in the next couple of weeks and would very much like the opportunity to meet with the human rights organisation and the advocate.
death penalty
