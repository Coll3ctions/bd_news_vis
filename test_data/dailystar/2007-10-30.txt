disposing of court orders in a week's time
we appreciate the decision by the dhaka metropolitan police to have court orders disposed of within seven days of their receipt. indeed, the fact that the police department has acted on its own to take such a step reflects the desire for improved performance on the part of the police. this is especially important considering that for years the police have been under a cloud regarding their reluctance to submit reports on cases filed by individuals as well as act on court orders on some pretext or the other. it has not been unusual for citizens to be put through long periods of suffering owing to the laid-back attitude of the police in responding to court orders. such suffering has been manifested through policemen asking for illegal gratification, sometimes from both parties to a dispute, as a precondition to the filing of reports. additionally, there is a long record of the police filing no cases at all where the accused have been people wielding political influence.
