after the ceasefire in gaza . . .
the ceasefire in gaza, declared unilaterally by israel and followed by the announcement of a seven-day suspension of action by hamas, should be an opportunity for positive developments in the region. egyptian president hosni mubarak has already held a summit on the issue, which from a certain perspective may be described as a happening rather too late in the day. the conspicuous silence of most arab states during the three weeks of israeli bombardment and occupation of gaza was disturbing. a more proactive attitude on the part of these states could have been a warning to ehud olmert and his government that their military assault was endangering the prospects for peace in the future. even more worrying was the silence of palestinian president mahmud abbas, who of course has now decided that the ceasefire declared by the israelis is insufficient. he is right there, but his earlier inability to speak up against tel aviv's relentless bombardment of the palestinians in gaza will rankle.
