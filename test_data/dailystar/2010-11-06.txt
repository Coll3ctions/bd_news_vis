'drugs' manufactured underground
criminality appears to be taking an increasingly wider dimension in the country. that, at least, is the impression one has now that a fake drugs factory has been discovered in the capital. what does cause amazement is the fact that the spurious medicine factory was unearthed by the law enforcers only a day after the high court ordered a testing of all medicine samples at present available in the market. with the discovery of this factory and the nabbing of the individuals behind it, one is impelled into asking how such activities can go on and through individuals who appear to have little or no fear of the repercussions of their actions, not only for themselves but also for those who are the targets of their wrong acts. now that this so-called factory has been exposed, there is the very legitimate fear among citizens that more such dens may be in operation all across the city and indeed at various spots across the country. judging by the fact that it is not only the young couple involved in this particular case but also a host of other unscrupulous elements engaged with them in the sordid business, one can safely draw the conclusion that a wider network may be at work here.

my memories of bangladesh
my first contact with the people of what was to become the state of bangladesh was in 1943 during world war ii. my battery was moving by road through bihar, undivided bengal into arakan in the then burma. i was appalled by the starvation i saw. it was pathetic. we tried to help by cutting our soldiers' rations in half and distributing it to the people en route. it was a matter of great anguish to me to see the disappointment in the starving people around our field kitchen outside dhaka when the food for each man, two chappaties and dal/bhaji, ran out. i decided to get more food to distribute.

a question of loyalty
this column is dedicated to humanity's best friend, a poor dumb animal found in an increasing number of homes in asia. it may not be intelligent, but it is loyal. it might not be able to express complex sentences, but it can communicate a bit by growling, howling, etc. it can be smelly, furry and unsightly, but many people are willing to overlook such shortcomings for an animal, which is simple, faithful and predictable. i overheard my wife telling a friend the other day, "they're no trouble, as long as you remember to feed them from time to time." view the page literature
to photocopy or not to, that is the question
the writer mani shankar mukherji, famously known as sankar, and celebrated for such works as chowringhee, was in town recently. in this issue of star literature, we carry literary impressions of the visit from a whole range of those who have had the opportunity to interact with sankar.
lighting lamps with sankar
‚Äúi tried my hand at everything, from mathematics to guarding shoes, from painting to pitman's shorthand, but nothing quite seemed to be my calling,‚Äù remarked sankar, wryly recalling his struggle to success. but at the young age of 21 when he took up his pen to write, words flowed effortlessly and the rest, as they say, is history.

thank you, sankar!
mani sankar mukherji aka sankar has had the rare distinction of becoming a legend in his own time. there is hardly an educated household in both bengals where at least one of his books has not been read. although a prolific author, in the popular imagination he is best known for three books: koto ajanere, chowringhee and seemabaddha with chowringhee being perhaps most iconic. forty seven years after chowringhee was first published and made sankar a household name in bengal, a recent english translation, in 2009, has brought him well-deserved although belated world-wide recognition. view the page star health

bangladesh: new impetus in counter-terrorism effort
if i am asked about the different dimensions added to the studies of twenty first century terrorism then i would refer to the latest inclusion of terrorism into the study of disaster management. in many universities of western world now terrorism is studied giving equal importance as much as given to the other disasters like earthquake, typhoon, flood, drought etc, but why? because terrorism successfully emerged as a real catastrophic threat to the progress of human development. terrorism is a man made disaster. though ironically it is true that scholars are yet to define terrorism properly but concept like counter-terrorism has already emerged. counter-terrorism involves those offensive measures taken to prevent, deter and respond to terrorism. bangladesh also entered into that phase with some limited developments. thanks go to european union for their recent initiatives taken to build a regional counter-terrorism centre here in dhaka. the regional counter-terrorism centre will be set up in with financial and technological assistance from european union to train people across south asia to combat terrorism. the international standard centre will start functioning by early next year. renowned counter-terrorism experts from european countries, united states and canada will train investigators, police and intelligence agency personnel to fight terrorism. the centre will be the second in its type and the first one was established in indonesia (national anti-terrorism agency (bnpt) way back in august this year. now let us see the implications of bnpt typed centre in dhaka in the present context of bangladesh and why not other countries like india and pakistan were not chosen as a host country.

lest we forget the dead of 1943
in late october ended, seventy years ago, the battle of britain. britain roughed up through a barrage of nazi assault. i read about it and thought about the glory of britain at that hour, of churchill's leadership.i was in awe - shabash britain. i am sure many people from privileged circles in india at the time were also relieved. being of the present generation and coming of a middle-class family, i can vaguely trace this strain back in my life and it is interesting to me how that has lived on and how i have changed.
the liberated soul of a poet

a river, a woman
