cold war
bangladesh as a tropical country usually enjoys a reasonable winter, but since december 7, 2011, the country has been hit by a severe cold wave with dense fog. generally in december, the average temperature for most of the country is about 10 degrees c. but, according to the meteorological department, the temperature this year has been 2 to 5 degrees c lower than the normal average temperature. the current temperature of 4-6 degrees celsius is considered to be very low for bangladesh, and in some parts the temperature went down to 4.5 degrees c, which is, according to the meteorological department, the lowest-ever temperature recorded for last 45 years. arguably, this may be a result of climate change and perhaps the developed carbon-emitting countries are to blame, but regardless of the cause, the results are ours to deal with.
