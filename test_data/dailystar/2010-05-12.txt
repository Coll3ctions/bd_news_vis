revising mpo list is a bad move
the cabinet criticism of the recently announced mpo list of non-government secondary and higher secondary institutions raises once more the spectre of partisan politics undermining a positive national cause. the prime ministerial decision, to review the list prepared by a competent committee we would like to make it clear, is not only hasty but also gives out some very bad signals about the future of education in the country. it is particularly painful because of the very sincere efforts made by education minister nurul islam nahid to have the mpo list finalised in line with the criteria set for it. given that the mpo was in the period of some earlier governments stigmatized by political considerations coming into it, minister nahid's judicious move to streamline the entire process was a refreshing sign of positive change in the field of education. the criteria on which the mpo list is based are unambiguously clear: student numbers, the number of students appearing at public examinations every year, the pass rate and the dates of government approval of the schools in question.

education outside dhaka
being the founder teacher and trainer of an english medium school at tangail, karatia, i had the opportunity to be part of the recruitment process.
gender bias
gender discrimination starts from birth and continues throughout life in bangladesh. bangladesh is a highly patriarchal society and gender discrimination is evident across all levels. women are dependent on men throughout their lives, from their fathers through to husbands, brothers or sons. the perceived lesser value and limited roles of girls and women are embedded in the socio-economic system.
ngo activities
being a third world country, bangladesh is burdened with many problems like over-population, poverty, pollution, poor education and health facilities etc. the present govt. has adopted many strategies and policies to overcome this situation doing their level best with the co-ordination of many ngos across the country. but the recent activities of many ngos are not much satisfactory to boost the socio-economic and infrastructural development as they are busy collecting funds from donor countries. but they have inadequate capacity to implement the programmes. however, it is true that ngos play the most important role to empower women to make them self-reliant launching many projects like micro-credit programmes and they have already attained many success in the rural areas of the country. but the problem is that there are many ngos which have no registration at all but they are still running their network countrywide. innocent people in villages may be cheated by a group of dishonest persons who sometimes show their fake documents to grab money and after managing that they move away. so, there should be accountability and transparency in the ngos' activities.

nostalgia and nausea
the narrow foggy road, leading my tender legs to walk at dawn to the mosque to pray, has all the potential to be remembered. joy in playing truant has every reason to be nostalgic about; salami earned on eid days meant the money adding extra pleasure to the big day. departure of many known faces from the worldly life caused my extreme desire to know why they had to meet death! with age soaring up and experience being gathered the world teaches what to ask and what not to ask, what can be done and what can't be done. day by day my experience of how unruly a human being can be started to mount high.
lawbreakers
i remember, some time in mid 80s, i noticed a news item in the corner of a daily newspaper which read "the traffic police have banned use of tinted glass in the cars". i immediately decided to remove my car's tinted sheet from the windows. the very next day or only a day after, while i was on my way to garage to do the job, i was intercepted near kalyanpur by a traffic sergeant. he stopped my car, sidelined it and told me that i had violated the government order. i tried to convince him that i was on my way to get it done. he didn't care and started to write something in his book. however, after a compromise he released my car. i removed the tinted sheets from my car but many did not. after a few days the rule was ineffective because the ministers and high-ups were using tinted glasses in their cars.
