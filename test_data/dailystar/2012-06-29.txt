attaining zero maternal mortality
it is said that about 25 lakh deliveries take place in the country every year and about 3.5 lakh mothers suffer from delivery-related complications. and still 85 percent births in our country benefit from medical facilities. our maternal deaths fell from 322 per 100,000 in 2001 to 194 in 2010, a 40 percent decline in nine years. but still attaining mdg-5 requires a lot of efforts…to achieve a further reduction of 25 percent. moreover, in the recent years an understanding is growing that reducing maternal mortality and morbidity is not solely an issue of development, but a matter of human rights. the human rights council specifies a range of human rights directly implicated by maternal mortality and morbidity in its resolution 11/8, paragraph 2. now no scope remains for ignoring the fact that safe motherhood is a woman's right.
egg grows wings
prices of essentials, especially food items are going up alarmingly. according to a report published in the daily star on june 23, 2012, common people are in a very difficult situation as eggs, the cheapest source of protein, have gone out of their reach. in the last one month, the prices of eggs and broiler chickens have gone up by 20 to 25 percent. it could be learnt that the situation would not have become so acute had the government paid attention to the poultry farmers' appeal for support during the bird flu outbreak. at that t6ime, farmers had to close more than 50,000 poultry farms. neglect of the government is responsible for the sufferings of the people, but does the government care at all?
retarded traffic costs nation immensely
on 15th june, i travelled from dhaka to rangpur by bus and it took 9 hours. again i came back to dhaka from gaibandha by bus and it took 8 hours. in both cases, it took 50% extra time. i failed to understand the reasons of this delay. inefficiency of the people responsible for traffic management, lack of knowledge about traffic rules, unauthorised occupation of the road etc could be the reasons. but who is to blame? we all are to be blamed. our combined civic sense can lessen the problem to a great extent. but it can not happen unless the law enforcing authorities lay a responsible role and act accordingly.
consumption-based power tariff
world bank's observation that subsidy on power helps the better off people and not people in rural areas, who are much poorer, is a fact. the fact is that desco rates for electricity in dhaka, where most of the well-to-do people live, is lower than reb which supplies power to rural areas!
reducing city's population pressure
bangladesh has an estimated population of 16 crore. imagine how many people fit into this small country. it is really astounding. on the other side, look at the countries like usa, canada and russia. their population is really low. of course, bangladesh is an overpopulated country and day by day its population is increasing. let's take a look at dhaka. we cannot even move around the city comfortably. we get stuck in unbearable traffic jam for hours. most of the important government and private offices are situated in dhaka. so every day thousands of people go to their workplace and this creates a huge traffic jam.
benefits of walking
i lost much weight during my stay in the national university for training, simply because vastness of the bari bhaban where we stayed made us to walk long distances. besides, the wide paths edged with different kinds of trees and flower gardens facilitated our walking. but once at home after training, i started to gain weight and now i feel heavy simply because here i have almost no facility for walking, as roads in my locality are occupied by small businessmen and unlicensed vehicles. 
penalise littering
i have witnessed factories indiscriminately dumping their waste on the streets. this waste contains an infinite amount of bacteria which can spread diseases; the smell of it is intolerable and ots look of the garbage heaped on the street is disgusting. ever since the dhaka city corporation (dcc) has been split into two, i have seen practically no improvement in our city's living conditions. i feel that fines and other forms of punishment must be introduced for dumping waste on the street. even pedestrians and people travelling by buses or cars throw rubbish on the roads. the only way to put a stop to this is setting up a vigilante force who would patril the streets and enforce laws.

minister at home
i have got an idea about how to save this government a great deal of embarrassment. it simply needs to rename the finance ministry to home ministry, and that can solve half of its problems. the functions of the two ministries will still remain the same. the home ministry can be snazzed up with a new name like the ministry of interior. but the finance ministry will feel more like home. the finance minister will be able to say what he likes. he will be able to treat his ministry like his home.

no reason to abandon rohingyas
apparently, bangladesh's pushback of helpless rohingyas from its territorial waters into those of myanmar seems to have worked. or has it? given that 30,000 were afflicted in the latest eruption of ethnic violence in rakhine state capital sittwe, this may have been just a stalling operation.
the new army chief, politicians, and elections
general iqbal karim bhuiyan has taken over charge as the new chief of army staff. in well established democratic societies, appointment of the new army chief is a routine administrative affair that does not evoke public interest more than a matter of general information on an important institution of the country. however, in case of bangladesh, the appointment of the new army chief is observed closely due to special circumstances. the particular case being the next parliamentary elections expected to be held by the end of 2013. historically, the army has played an important and positive role in holding free and fair elections. given the degree of partisanship that the political parties have injected into important branches of governance like civil service, police, and judiciary -- army is looked upon as one of the very few public institutions that have remained above partisan interest.
