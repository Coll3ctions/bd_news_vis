uz chairmen, vice-chairmen make a valid point
the issue of what kind of local government we mean to have in bangladesh has once again been highlighted through the convention of upazila chairmen and vice chairmen in dhaka. that it needs these elected representatives of the people at the grassroots level to inform the country and the government about the state of inactivity they have been forced into not only raises questions about the future of democracy but also makes a mockery of this entire idea of local bodies supervising development work at the local levels. let us make no mistake about it: when upazila chairmen, vice-chairmen and members complain that they have no specific responsibilities other than having tea, engaging in small talk and going back home, they are not indulging in humour. they are raising a fundamental issue of how and why the very principle of local government may be getting undermined in the country.

evicting hawkers!
a staff correspondent's front-page report of 3rd october on the matter was published in a local english daily. the proposal of evicting all hawkers, given for reducing traffic congestion, seemed rather off the mark to me! the hawkers may block the pedestrians' flow on footpaths to an extent, but its impact on the flow of road traffic is somewhat marginal. it may aggravate the jam in one or two roads, particularly around baitul mukarram, but it is not a reason for traffic congestion in most city roads. will the eviction of hawkers, as proposed, not lead to another opportunity of flow of 'bakshis' for our policemen? they can always arrange an unofficial daily fine, while the hawkers carry on their trade! the hawkers are rather poor and transient traders who cannot afford a regular shop or stall to sell their wares. this step, if adopted, may lead to many lower income people and their families being cut off from their livelihood.

patients need privacy
it is a matter of great regret that many physicians in our country do not care about the privacy of their patients. they examine patients at their chambers in the presence of other patients and their relatives. it is objectionable and embarrassing, because patients have to narrate their symptoms and answer many questions for the sake of the diagnosis. those should be for the doctor's ears only. the physicians should have enough sense to know that patients need privacy and it is their (doctors') sacred duty to provide it.
