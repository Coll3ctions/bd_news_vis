the executive-police relationship
the citizen's aspirations for good governance would surely seek clarity as to the relationship between the political executive and police. coming to specifics, the particular interest would be to see how the relationship can be delineated in statutes. there is, understandably, a pressing need to understand how police organisations are held accountable in democratic polity and also the role of political executive in police accountability.
facing some pressing issues
local government institutions (lgis) can play a significant role in the overall development of a country. since majority of population of developing countries live at the local level, structure of the local government bodies should be designed in such a way that these bodies are administered by elected representatives. at the same time, avenues should be created for participation of local people in the decision making bodies. involvement of citizens in the political decision making process can be considered as a prerequisite to establish good governance and democracy. nowadays it has been realized that real development is difficult keeping citizens away from the policy-making process. realizing the essence of strengthening lgis, the government of bangladesh reintroduced the upazila parishad (uzp) in 2009.

a poet's late appearance

pubail sojourn
it was like a 1950s hindi movie set. or was it like a hawaiian movie set or a scene from the tlc channel set in the maldives? beautiful straw and bamboo cottages evoking memories of a caribbean paradise with beautiful ladies, frolicking children, gentle breezes, wide expanses of hyacinth infested water bodies, delicious food, charming conversation, singing and dancing. impromptu poetry recitals. romantic interludes under a humongous moon peeping in and out of autumnal clouds. torrents of rain - then flashes of sunlight, temperatures not too unbearable. distant rolling thunder. a firefly or two setting hearts on fire. cerebral conversation, evocative laughter. loud singing in the distance in accompaniment of kortals, cymbals, dholok and the harmonium.

nepal on the brink, again!
democracies sometimes have to go through ridiculous rituals. it has been more than two months after madhav kumar nepal resigned as nepal's prime minister. eight rounds of election has thus far failed to elect a new leader. the fact that the country does not yet have a constitution and that the present house is not a regular hung parliament like in britain rather the first elected constituent assembly formed to write a new statute of the country compounds the already complex problem. the annual budget is already two months late and indications are that without a consensus across party-lines, the current lame-duck government will not be able to present the budget let alone ratify it.
afghanistan: phoenix rising from the ashes
the afghans have once again proved many pundits wrong. sceptics who were predicting that the parliamentary election on september 18th cannot be held in the face of the taliban resistance were disappointed. the taliban failed to cause any dent on the afghan resolve and despite scattered violence, the polling went ahead smoothly. peaceful holding of the election is, no doubt, a big achievement for the afghan people and the government. it is true that there were many problems in the election. there were forged voter id cards, ghost-voters on the voter-list, ex-warlords and ex-taliban seeking votes, poor voter turn-out on the election day and numerous complaints of voting irregularities. yet, hundreds of candidates, including women, contested the election, thousands held rallies and campaigned for their candidates and in the end, millions went to the polling stations. this was proof enough of the peoples' desire to see a modern democratic afghanistan, rather than a strict islamic theocracy that the talibans offer.

the nature of development economics
prominent development economist amartya sen won the nobel prize in 1998. he is the author of development as freedom . freedom, sen argues, 'is both the end and most efficient means of sustaining economic life and the key to securing the general welfare of the world's entire population…in the new global economy… the contemporary world denies elementary freedom to vast numbers… it is still possible to practically and optimistically restrain a sense of social accountability.' the nobel laureate thus brings an 'ethical dimension' to the technical study of economic.

of books and power
michael foot was a brilliant intellectual who also happened to be a politician. in an earlier era, he might have been a philosopher-king or a wise counsellor to a monarch in the best traditions of history. you could think here of merlin in that old tale of king arthur and his knights of the round table. there was a profusion of wisdom in merlin, something which only reinforced itself when one day he chose to venture a metaphysical explanation of a spate of gloom in the king. when arthur looked out the window and intoned, sadly, “it is a dark day, a troubled day”, merlin told him in dispassionate manner, “it is a day, just a day, my lord. you have a dark and troubled mind.”
