pm's significant observations
we appreciate prime minister sheikh hasina's perceptive, forthright and, to an extent, introspective, remarks about bureaucrats in a cabinet meeting on monday. she counseled her cabinet colleagues to be wary of bureaucrats who give primacy to loyalty and tend to hide their under-performance behind such obeisance. they sugarcoat their 'insincerity', sometimes bordering on the sycophantic, saying things that would only please the government as the ground under the latter's feet slipped away beneath a make-believe veneer of self-confidence and complacency.
israel's raid on aid-carrying ships
israel's attack on an aid flotilla trying to break its siege of gaza is a clear outrage. and it is so because it not only flouts international law but also shows the patent defiance of the zionist state of the global community where its treatment of palestinians is concerned. in these past three years, for all the opprobrium it has earned over its actions, israel has continued its blockade of gaza and so has made it extremely hard for its residents to lead normal lives. one reason for israel's aggressive moves has been the predominance of hamas in the region. the unfortunate reality has been that the tel aviv government has successfully been able to ward off all calls for a lifting of the siege. no effort expended toward pushing israel into a less hardline stance has succeeded. the bigger reality is that israel's friends in the west have, save some temporary pressure from washington, not quite been able to push it toward a settlement. view the page sports

the sky, the mind, the ban culture
the ban on facebook could be lifted within days. or perhaps by the time you read this in print, it might already have been withdrawn. but that is not what exercises our minds at this point. what we are upset about is the brusqueness with which the attack on facebook was made. of course, if there is anything obscene that has appeared on it, if the reputations of citizens, powerful or meek, have been ridiculed, all that the authorities needed to do was to go after those who indulged in such nefarious deeds. but to assume that an entire system can be done away with or simply run out of town only rekindles in us all the old thoughts of bygone rulers trying to govern us through control mechanisms that eventually did not amount to much. control led to chaos. the mechanisms broke down.
