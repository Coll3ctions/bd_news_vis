pm's call for security coordination
prime minister sheikh hasina has directed the various intelligence agencies to work in a coordinated manner so that the kind of tragedy that befell the bangladesh rifles last month and other tragic happenings in earlier years do not recur. the prime minister's thoughts are not only appreciated but also shared by the nation as a whole. there can be no denying that repeated intelligence failures, beginning with the assassinations of bangabandhu in 1975 and president ziaur rahman in 1981 and leading up to the bdr carnage on february 25, have left the nation traumatised. all these failures have now thrown up the question of what must be need to restructure or reconfigure the intelligence bodies as a way of ensuring foolproof national security in the future.
good sense prevails in pakistan
we are hugely relieved at pakistan's pullback from the precipice of a dangerous slide into destabilisation. as opposition leader nawaz sharif's defiant long march on islamabad was building into a crescendo, prime minister yousuf raza gilani announced a package of concessions on monday defusing the tension to a very large extent. what was threatening to become a full-blown political crisis centring around reinstatement of iftikhar mohammad chaudhury as chief justice along with six other judges has, hopefully, been averted.
pakistan and its brave new men and women

insufficient fire fighting system
the fire in bashundhara city once again confirmed our inadequacy in extinguishing a devastating fire in a multi-storeyed building. we are totally handicapped with our limited and primitive fire-fighting equipment. thousands of pedestrians were helplessly looking at the building.
irrigation with waste water
a very interesting report from narsingdi, on the subject was published by a local english daily on march 4. it is a positive reflection on the initiative of badc officials there. they have managed to utilise the waste cooling water from two power plants for irrigation! with their initiative, they have arranged to irrigate around 45, 000 acres of land for rice plantation which is expected to produce about 78,500 tonnes of irri and boro paddy!
pre-monsoon drive
in the 1960s and early 1970s, the pre-monsoon city sewerage and drainage systems cleaning drive used to be a major annual activity of dhaka city corporation and wasa. this operation helped prevent occurrence of water logging of dhaka streets during monsoon. it is not known why such an important operation was abandoned resulting in flooding of the city streets during every monsoon. lest the new govt miss this impending crucial problem through oversight, i would like to draw the attention of the mps concerned, before it is too late, to the crux of the problem. it is believed that the following cleaning operation in a professional and concerted manner would greatly reduce the intensity of the dhaka city water logging during the coming rainy season.
power supply disruption
at present after traffic congestion, power cut is the second gravest problem in dhaka city. on a daily basis, we have to suffer at least 4-5 hours from persistent electricity disruption. however, it's no longer a new issue in dhaka city. it's been discussed many times, but no effective measures have been taken to solve this problem. we see many experts talking about nuclear power generation, but so far nothing effective has been implemented. are all these experts supposed to only talk on this issue or can they be utilized to fix this problem through implementing the nuclear project by means of government's direct intervention?
children with disabilities
entrance of children with disabilities to education is limited. an unequal educational structure, inflexible & unfriendly education programmes, lack of consciousness of parents, compounded with the insufficient knowledge of teachers and the inhospitable environment existing in the majority of the institutions, have done incredibly little to support education of children with disabilities in bangladesh.
not really funny
this is a very ordinary event and may have escaped attention. but i was shocked and surprised. i cannot forget it. it has a continuous presence in my mind although i did not see this incident myself - a visitor threw a chocolate in front of the cage of a bear in dhaka zoo. the bear for nearly half an hour tried through the small hole of the cage with its outstretched tongue to catch the chocolate and eat it. it looked like the bear brought out his tongue about a foot to reach the item. he finally failed. nobody helped the bear to get it. people witnessing this would surely have been jubilant at this `funny' scene. but was it a fun? i feel bad when i think how hungry the bear was. is it not cruelty? this is one example. there are countless incidents of cruelty meted out to the animals and birds of zoo/circus and in other places. imagine how it would be like if we hear this type of 'fun' made with helpless starving children! do the authorities of the zoo properly feed captive animal/birds? do they take care so that the visitors do not disturb the zoo inmates ?
carpetbaggers?
it is a common practice for the leaders of political parties to stand for elections in as many as three constituencies. if they succeed in obtaining multiple seats, they have to retain one and surrender the others. this paves the way for by-elections, and in most cases other local candidates submit their nomination papers. in bogra this year, two of the opposition leader's seats have fallen vacant and thus there will be two by-elections, as she has chosen to retain her seat in feni.
bdr mutiny
in order to avoid mass killing, the prime minister's speech to the nation, particularly to the bdr mutineers, was perfect and timely. the speech definitely expedited the process of the mutineers' surrender. the pm's decision to negotiate with the leaders of the mutineers was absolutely correct both diplomatically and politically. but now that some officers unearthed their untold sufferings and are arguing in favour of raid by the armed forces soon after the attack, many people are in confusion and are passing the comment that the government decision was probably late and wrong.
pakistan-a failed state
it is clear that pakistan is about to fall in the category of a “failed state”. since its birth, the military has been dominating over everything including governance. in the past it looted the wealth of its east wing (now bangladesh) - at present they are involved in fighting with each other. who is ruling the country? president, army or some other force? no one can say.
reorganise bdr
i wholly support former president hussain mohammad ershad's view with regard to disbanding the present bdr.
iraq's orchards
it is heartening to learn that the us agency for international development (usaid) and future agriculture development organization (fado) have undertaken a program to help invigorate iraq's horticultural industry. as a part of this programme, 50,000 high-yield grape vines and fruit tree-stock grown in california nurseries are being distributed among the farmers to assist them revitalize their once vibrant orchards and vineyards.
role of mps
i would like to convey my gratitude to md. anwarul kabir for his recently published article, entitled "role of mps in light of constitution". in this scholarly write-up, mr. kabir has rightly pointed out the constitutional role of our mps. unfortunately, in our country, deviated from the constitutionally defined role, the mps are very eager to involve themselves in local development work. mr. kabir has revealed that the major motivation on their part to be mps is to be millionaire within a short span of time by indulging in corruption and the local development works give them such opportunity. this culture must be changed. the honourable prime minister has called for changes in her electoral pledge. we want to trust our leader. so, for the better future of the country, we would like to urge the prime minister to empower the local government, especially the upazilas and let them carry out all development works. mps must concentrate on the issues of state policy making which is their prime obligation. this, in turn, will reduce corruption at the state level, we believe.

a digital bangladesh?
the present democratically elected awami league government has made the promise to the young generation of building a digital bangladesh. for some reason, the government has banned youtube for bangladeshi users. this is unthinkable in this world of information technology. in this 21st century, when we are dreaming of moving forward, our government has stepped backwards. will they again say that they will make a digital bangladesh?
traffic congestion

hostage crisis management
mr. muhit rahman certainly deserves thanks for his write up published in the editorial page of 12 march 2009. like many, it appears that mr. muhit had been a keen observer of the recent pilkhana incident and burnt midnight candle to gain knowledge on the hostage crisis management. but to me it appeared that he had been rather unkind in making certain comments. view the page international
