only 300 audit reports before pac since 1973!
we will begin at the beginning. two per cent of bangladesh's gdp growth is swallowed up by corruption. that is a distinctly uncomfortable sign of how the objective of a promotion of public welfare is all too easily and regularly defeated. and now comes the revelation, per courtesy of a roundtable in the city the other day, that of the thousand audit reports prepared and submitted to the jatiya sangsad since 1973, only 300 have been discussed by the public accounts committee of parliament in all these years. incredible as it may sound, the fact remains that the revelation shows up an image of the abysmal failure of institutional bodies where dealing with public concerns is the issue.

students these days
we are much worried to see the recent instability in the educational institutions all over bangladesh. clashes are not only between the student bodies of political parties but also within the same factions of political wings. these pictures are not new. with the change of regime student bodies of the ruling party start creating anarchy in the educational institutions.
rickshaw menace
if anybody says rickshaw is the most powerful and fastest vehicle in dhaka, nobody will disagree. it is so powerful that it can stop any motorized vehicle inside the road by its changing of direction as per its will. it pays little attention while changing courses disregarding other vehicles. as it does not need any fuel it runs by manual power which seems to be very judiciously applied by its puller. once the rickshaw attains a high speed its puller is reluctant to lower down the speed by its hand brake, lest the rickshaw would require further manual pressure by the puller totally disregarding other motorized vehicles speeding fast. this type of mad race by rickshaws with motorized vehicles sometimes poses a great threat to pullers themselves. their wanton violation of traffic rules puts extra pressure on law enforcers maintaining traffic, especially at the road intersections, pedestrians, and also on the users of other vehicles. their free style driving of rickshaws demonstrates their intention of realizing good penalty from the users of motorized vehicles for any damage or injury due to collision with motorized vehicles. so the users of motorized vehicles are always scared of the rickshaws.
diversities
bangladesh is a land of ethnic, cultural and religious diversities. people of different backgrounds have been living here for centuries.
music
i admit because of the advancement of newer technologies, our young generation's taste of music has changed dramatically over the years. moreover, we have now quite a few good number of musicians in our country who are capable of composing songs using all the latest software and instruments. the albums by these composers are selling like hotcakes as our young generations find them very interesting. since they have huge fan following, these composers do not dare to come in front of the microphone and give voices as well since they do not have the melodious voice which is required for a singer. they use auto tuner and all the other technologies to overcome their limitations and all the other shortcomings. but i feel in this process, we the listeners are the losers and these composers are becoming the so-called famous singers. i think these composers are cheating us. although they have better knowledge in music than we the general listeners have, that does not necessarily mean that they have the right to cheat us in this way. they are receiving appreciation and earning money which they do not deserve. when these composers sing on any live event, they get exposed. since they do not have basic training in singing, how could we expect them to perform on live shows? i think it's high time for us to realise this. we have many talented singers in our country who have melodious voice but we treat them badly. we should treat singers by their voice.
traffic problem
i'm talking about the traffic system of bangladesh and now in the modern world where every day researchers wake up with new innovations to save the valuable time of people. but bangladesh has no headache about the traffic system. the roads are deplorable and the signal light are just for show as many of them don't work and in most of the places the traffic sergeant controls the system manually. of course, the entire fault is not of the government, bus drivers and others often aggravate the situation. even the car owners park their cars in the road. restaurants, shopping malls, hospitals etc have no parking places.
significance of “miraj”

pm's call to leader of the opposition!

global crisis
there is no denying that the global economic crisis has hit the whole world hard. the usa, being a leading country controlling world economy, has been affected severely by the crisis, which has given birth to global joblessness. every day we find the news of many organisations limiting their activities, leading to job loss.
back to the screen!
the vocal members of the said samaj are back on tv screen again. initially they would confine themselves to empowerment of local government, a good subject for long debate, and then gradually enter into the mainstream politics including the bdr carnage.
dowry
discrimination against women is a common thing in bangladesh. for this reason women are deprived of their fundamental rights, and they are not aware of their rights also. they are directly affected by dowry.
failures
the only information on the action or lack thereof regarding the feb 25 incident has come from the press alone. to date, the government does not deem it necessary to provide regular briefings outside of self-serving prepared press releases. the recent news item “bdr hq hardly cordoned off” stands as glaring testament to a shameful and careless reflection of compounded failure of the chain of command by the so-called “authority”. it permeates its inescapable lack of comprehension of the seriousness of the events on the ground. the best explanations they can muster up is that their respective departments “were working under the directives”. might we ask what these directives were?
the army, our pride
recently, we lost so many talented military officials. these officers were most valuable assets of our country. they had done their best at every crucial moment. but we could do nothing when scores of army officers were killed in the most inhuman way.

heather mcnamara of usa is not a celebrity. still she made a history!
british council facilities
british council is a centre of excellence for learning english. it offers for its members basically three facilities-- internet browsing at cyber zone, english listening at resource centre & book reading & borrowing for three weeks in library. hence, three kinds of membership-- general membership, open learning membership & family membership. three months ago it had 28 computers in its cyber zone. at present only 20 computers are available. members can use 18. so sometimes we see a queue for browsing internet, we have to wait for 5 to 15 minutes. the situation was not like this three weeks ago. because then computers were available.
feeling honoured
a few years back i visited chennai for some medical treatment. one afternoon when we had no work with the hospital, we visited a shopping mall. we had enough time that afternoon and were looking leisurely at different shops. at one stage we were about to enter a big mall and noticed an elderly security officer with plenty of medals on his uniform. i had a closer look on those, which the security officer noticed. he very politely asked me what i was looking for. i enquired about those medals. he then very proudly told me that he acquired those for his outstanding bravery in the liberation war of bangladesh. i was very curious and asked him where he was posted during the war of liberation in bangladesh in 1971. he vividly narrated that his troops had a fierce fight in brahmanbaria, kasba & ashuganj. i was extremely moved by his words. i told him that i was from bangladesh. i belong to brahmanbaria. to my surprise, the security officer instantly saluted me.
talk show guests
though it is not recommended to begin anything with a negative statement, but to call spade a spade, we are worried about our nation's immediate future. yes, it is true that we had always been worried about many aspects of our national affairs since its independence: politics, governance, unemployment, price hike, education system, health facility, traffic jam, corruption and, lately terrorism. but, now we are witnessing an entirely different type of challenge. view the page international
