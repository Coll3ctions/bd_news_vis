a stitch in time saves nine
in the first place the conditions of the two strategic bridges over the meghna and gumti should not have been allowed to come to such a pass at all. it is simply unacceptable that these two bridges would be in such a state of disrepair that would involve major repair work with the potential of disrupting the direct link between chittagong and dhaka for quite sometime.
price hike before ramadan
that a racket of hoarders and retailers push up prices of certain food items before and during the month of ramadan is not new for the consumers in bangladesh. what is really new, however, is that the commerce minister himself admitted to this despicable trend a few days back. and we felt relieved when he warned all profit-mongers involved with the racket of "stern action" and also assured us of having sent "14 teams to different markets to identify them" while replying to a lawmaker's query in the parliament on july 2. but in less than a week, we are dismayed to see a continuous increase of prices of onions, gram and lentils with the government apparently unable to do anything against the market manipulators. view the page sports

migrant workers deserve humane treatment
imagine being hauled off to a foreign land in search of better economic prospects in harsh working conditions and poorly paid jobs. imagine being subject to humiliation and harassment by your own countrymen. yes, this is a situation our migrant workers have to face on a daily basis. my heart fills with sadness, and mostly anger, every time i witness how we, as a nation, treat migrant workers with such contempt in our airports. our workers are made to wait for hours in long immigration queues and repeatedly harassed by airport authorities. we laugh and sneer at them when they ask for help. we look down on the very people we share the same flight with. how many of us are aware of the fact that these are the very same people who are one of the biggest contributors to our national economy?

of acc, nhrc, and padma bridge
the world bank's decision to withdraw funding for the padma bridge is not as much an indictment of the awami league government as it is of a system of fool's gold. the same would have happened in a bnp administration. we may have fine sounding organisations like the acc and the nhrc, but the fact remains that those are little more, in practice, than toothless advisory panels made of tired ex-bureaucrats too scared to say a peep about government ministers and ruling party functionaries of the day. until the day that an acc prosecutes a cabinet member of the incumbent political administration or the nhrc hauls into court human rights violators belonging to the affiliated bodies of a ruling party, the only people who will believe these to be credible organisations will be the professional attendees of the numerous seminars in the various posh hotels in dhaka who have been talking for forty years and will do so for forty more.

irreparable damage done to the country
on june 30, 2012 the breaking news in the electronic media that "world bank cancelling its loan for padma bridge" came as a shock to us and we felt deeply ashamed. the government is fully responsible for losing the 1.2 billion credit for the padma bridge project because it did not pay heed to the world bank's repeated warning that they had proof about corruption in the bidding process, in which high level government officials were involved. the name of the former communications minister syed abul hossain came to the forefront. the government then removed him from his post and gave him another portfolio. the government should have done a thorough investigation about syed abul hossain and others who were involved in the scam and taken proper action against them. but it did not hesitate to degrade the country to save a few people.

on 26th june 2012 most of the dailies carried two important news with big headlines. the headlines were: "more than 1.22 lac loan defaulters in the country" and "government's proposal to hike electricity prices very soon." let me give an example of one unintentional loan defaulter whose name might have already been included in the 1.22 lac list. a friend of mine, an experienced businessman, established a textile manufacturing unit about a year back with bank loan. he imported sophisticated textile machinery by opening l/c from abroad. the time between l/c opening date and trial production was more than one year because of delay in getting electricity connection, setting up of machinery etc. by the time he completed setting up the machines at the factory, he failed to pay more than six instalments and became a defaulter according to bb rules. his company became disqualified for getting any further support.
