encounter in the twilight zone
it started with few verses, that i alif, wrote while in the west, which reached the desk of mr. z in the east, the decision maker of whether to print or not to print. such is the amazing work of e-mails! meanwhile, the instructions that accompanied the write-up in case it was to be acknowledged, was to use a pen name reflecting my desire to be anonymous. then one day, to my utter dismay, so to speak, while thumbing through the pages of the newspaper on the net, there it was…my verses and my name staring right back at me! my first venture in creative writing and i had no clue it was accepted. so, i decided to deal directly with mr. z, and hence the discourse began. my first e-note to mr. z with introduction, thanks and another poem attachment:

memory lane
on a lazy fall evening last week, the song “bhalobashi, bhalobashi, ey shurey kachey durey..” came floating down while i was fiddling with my tv clicker and switched to a bengali channel. a very familiar tagore song for me, rendered over the ages by various artistes, indrani, bonnya, sadi, you name it. what captured my attention this time were the last four lines of the lyrics:
the waiting
let him forget, in a million famines
i shall not forget, i shall not forget ever
let's burn
when suddenly the doors of the closed room are wide open
the maddening wind blows
the gloomy sky fills with bride-seeing golden light
or when sends calls to the forests
the first shower of monsoon
and the suddenly raised fragrance
of maiden shambar comes from the grass roots
and the village of the shabars in the dale

obama tries to allay indian fears
prime minister manmohan singh's visit to the united states was the first such visit by a head of state/government under the obama administration. the hosts used this point in the media to single out the visit as a special one. likewise, the state banquet given to the indian prime minister, where over 300 guests were invited, was also mentioned in the media in great details to underscore the care and the attention that the hosts have taken to make the visit remarkable. the president's choice of words to praise india and prime minister manmohan singh made it obvious that he was also trying to underscore the visit as more than an important one. he referred to the usual pitch that marks such visits between the two countries; theirs being the two largest democracies in the world. this time, the fact that both obama and manmohan singh have only recently assumed office (manmohan singh for a new term) and would have a long time to implement agreements reached between the two countries was added to the usual pitch to underscore the visit's importance.

a combination of the sacred and the mundane
"'the gods created man,' said srikanda stpathy, 'but here we are so blessed that we - simple men as we are - help to create the gods.'” this is how one of the stories in william dalrymple's latest book nine lives: in search of the sacred in modern india, begins. this seeming contradiction plays through most of the nine stories in the book: a nun who sweeps the steps before her with a peacock fan when she walks so as not to inadvertently step on any living creature, ritually starves herself to death; a dalit untouchable not allowed to use the water of the very well he helps to dig, is revered as a god for three months of the year and illiterate villagers who are still the guardians of an entire oral culture, able to recite a 4,000 line epic by heart.
no wisdom, but nuggets anyway . . .
edward kennedy's death a few months ago was cause for the celebration, in a manner of speaking, of a dynasty that yet exercises a hold on the public imagination. it does not really matter that the dynasty, as it used to be, does not happen to be there any more. that the mystique of the kennedys has become frayed over the years is no more in question. but, again, there is that certain reawakening of sensibilities, of memories, every time the kennedys are mentioned. that explains the grandeur of edward kennedy's funeral. the fact that he was the only kennedy brother to survive to ripe old age (he was seventy seven when he passed on) did little to stop the flow of a revival of popular interest in the clan. the obamas and the clintons and the bushes and the carters made sure, through their presence at kennedy's memorial services in boston, that the clan was remembered.
