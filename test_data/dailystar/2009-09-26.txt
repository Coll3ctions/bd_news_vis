the long road one politician has travelled
rare is the politician who has been part of nearly every government in bangladesh. and in this rarity moudud ahmed certainly holds prominent space. his career took off in the late 1960s, when as a young lawyer just back from london, he found himself drawn to the agartala conspiracy case as part of sheikh mujibur rahman's defence team. in subsequent years, at least for a while, he remained close to the man who would make history as bangabandhu and come to be revered as the father of bangladesh. but moudud ahmed was never part of the awami league government and indeed soon discovered, to his dismay, that the very principles of democracy and human liberty he had been waging battle for were being put at risk by the very politicians who had led bengalis to freedom from pakistan in 1971. mujib was irate at discovering that moudud had come to the legal defence of leftwing political elements who, in the former's view, were subversives intent on undermining the state.

it was 1958 and landon, a seventeen-year old boy, was growing up with the usual ups and downs that growing years hold. in his hometown, in beaufort, north california, landon had already dated a girl or two. the last person he had expected to enter his life was jamie sullivan, daughter of the town's baptist minister, hegbert. jamie was seventeen and went round with a bible in her hand. she seemed to be perfectly content to live her life set away from others. when others were having parties she was going round orphanages. when others were enjoying baseball games she was out rescuing hurt animals. yet by a streak of chance landon found himself very much involved with this girl, a girl whom all other friends labeled as “strange”.
dickens in morocco, sort of
if charles dickens had visited morocco, he might have written secret son, the tortured story of the twenty-year separation of a father and his son, set to the relevant social issues of morocco today: young people with diminished expectations; class, coincidence, intrigue, and slum life. any connections to the great victorian novelist end there. moreover, i was almost always more aware of the social and political issues confronting laila lalami's characters than their humanity.
it is all about movies
apart from a preservation of 2,169 films in its vaults and 3,053 books, 14,575 photographs, 6,677 posters, 1,986 screenplays, 9,950 film journals and other film related objects and documents in its library, bangladesh film archive (bfa) has set a new record for itself by publishing an annual journal focusing on film and film-related issues.
