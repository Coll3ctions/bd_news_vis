america's resurgent republicans
president obama's plain and simple sentence says it all. it feels bad, said he at his news conference on wednesday about the results of the mid-term elections. and well he might, for the outcome of the polls has clearly placed his policies in jeopardy. it may well be that the results will have an impact on his prospects for re-election in 2012, though it might be argued that at this point in their presidencies, ronald reagan and bill clinton went through a similar experience in mid-term defeat. the difficulty for mr. obama, though, is that he came to office two years ago promising change in america. his slogan of “yes we can” resonated all across the country, to a point where he was able to beat more well-known rivals for the democratic nomination before going on to beat the republican john mccain at the election. today, it is his enemies who are truly crowing. the president has himself acknowledged the difficulties he will clearly have with a congress whose incoming speaker has publicly asked him to change course.

death of a teacher
mizanur rashid was a solid man. he did not win a medal in the last commonwealth games, neither did he fight a renowned case in the court and win. his achievements are within his own perimeter of work. he tried to protest a wrongdoing. that was not done with a view to achieving any personal gain. in fact, not only did he volunteer in favour of discipline and decency, but he also was ready to put himself in danger doing so. he was ready; he was upright and bold to protect his students come what may. i believe that is called courage and dignity. he considered it his duty to uphold the honour and dignity of people around him. he wanted to ensure their rights.

a competent taxi service

children and cell phones
kids today, i'm talking about 10-year-olds, have convinced their parents that they desperately need cell phones. and not just any cell phones! they need unlimited 'texting' options, internet access, mp3 downloading capabilities and more. granting kids free access to too much information through the cell phones can be harmful. if they can't handle it responsibly they shouldn't be accessing it in the first place. we live in a very difficult and sometimes dangerous world. it is very easy for the children to receive text messages and pictures that the parents may not approve of. along with that, cell phones pose serious health hazards to the children. sometimes eve-teasing starts with a simple phone call to a teen.
