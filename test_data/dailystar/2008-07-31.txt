whatever the illusion the american media is trying to create, it is certain that barack obama will be the next president of us. he is a christian but, no doubt, he has muslim heritage. he will be the first african-american us president. so far, obama has proved to be a good, smart and popular person among christians and muslims (american), and among blacks and whites. his attitude toward world peace is generally acceptable, though, after his assumes office, there may be some changes due to exigencies of the situations.
it's about cricket
dr. m. shah alam's article, "sorry, it's about cricket," published in this newspaper caught my attention for a couple of reasons. first, it quite rightly highlighted the decline in the standard of cricket in bangladesh. i have no doubt that most people in the country share this disappointment.
