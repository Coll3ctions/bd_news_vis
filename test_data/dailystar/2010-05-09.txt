government directives to police to be professional
we are happy that the government has directed the police to go for tough action against the unruly elements of the chhatra league. we are happy too that police officers have been told to act professionally, that a failure to do so will result in disciplinary action against them. on the face of it, everything seems to be in order. the reality, however, is quite different. it has to do with the political culture that has developed, insidiously, in this country over a long period of time. we have a situation these days where many among the political classes, especially those who ascend to power at given periods, blur the distinction between the party and the government and, again, between the government and the state. that is a perfect instance of myopia. and in our present conditions, it has led to the menace today typified by the chhatra league.

international markets
the international markets remained highly volatile this week. the euro was intense selling pressure, and tumbled to a 14-month low against the dollar on thursday, reeling from escalating concerns that greece's debt crisis may spread to other euro zone states. "there are political constraints to the extent this greek fiscal adjustment can go and there is a risk of contagion," the ecb left interest rates on hold as widely expected, with attention switching to its press conference at 1230 gmt. european policymakers have warned the euro's survival depends on a life-support package for greece announced last week. this has ratcheted up risk aversion and boosted safe-haven demand for the dollar, pushing it to a one-year high versus a currency basket on thursday. by 1148 gmt, the euro traded 0.7 percent lower on the day. the euro trimmed losses after spain sold five-year government debt, albeit at a higher yield than at its last sale in march, quelling some market concerns over madrid's credit risks. view the page metropolitan

multidisciplinary research
it was encouraging to see the ministers approve of the idea of establishing the concept of research and research funding for improving agriculture, health and industry in our country in a programme organised by ntv at sonargaon hotel. innovation is the key to success of all countries and research is the stepping stone to innovation. a pro-research government would mean a lot in terms of solving existing problems and impediments and creating the environment for research and innovation. one of the major hurdles obstructing agricultural and medical research in the country is the rule of procurement of research perishables and chemicals as well as equipment. another is the lack of multidisciplinary approaches for solving a problem. for example, molecular sciences like biochemistry, molecular biology and biotechnology are contributing in a big way to medicine, agriculture as well as industry. it is the true partnership between these sciences that will lead to major milestones in improving health and agriculture for prosperity of the country.
aliens and we!
stephen hawking, the scientific authority of our generation, has advised us to avoid trying to seek out aliens from space. this news item was published in almost all local english dailies at the end of april. hawkins believes that there is every possibility that aliens exist somewhere in our planetary system! his reasons for avoiding our contacts with them (aliens) is based on our inglorious history of the so-called civilized west, when they discovered the two american continents. it was a saga of exploitation, butchery and inhumanity shown by these adventurers and subsequent settlers.
power cuts
in delhi city itself, they have power cuts for six hours daily. a country with such high record of development has a serious power shortage still in rural areas as well big cities like kolkata even. however, it is going to export power to bangladesh. bangladesh exports rice and vegetables and huge quantity of fish to the mid eastern countries when we are having shortage of it. the seven sisters of india have power that they can export but it is more expensive for them to pass it to far away states of theirs where there is shortage than bangladesh which is adjacent to them. and believe it or not, the reality is this that yangon has only two hours of power daily. the situation is horrible in pakistan too and in some provinces they do not have power for days particularly in northern part but that is mainly due to the political situation prevailing over there.
saarc summit
the 16th saarc summit was over with note of good hope as usual. now the most critical time is coming for implementation. let us wait as usual and see what is achieved. it is very difficult to guess the role the bnp might play to enhance the status of saarc said to be the brainchild of the former president ziaur rahman when they would assume power again.
acc
the decision of the present govt. regarding the acc in the cabinet meeting in presence of the prime minister has made the acc inactive, like in the past regime before the caretaker govt. of 2007. again it is proved that it is nothing but a constitutional body having no power to launch an anti-corruption drive. however, it is true that the role played by the acc after coming to power in 2007 was quite controversial. the acc had filed many cases against many politicians as well industrialists and businessmen as a part of the anti corruption drive following the set of rules to uproot corruption from the country. but it was quite impossible to solve this problem overnight because this had prevailed since the inception of bangladesh.
qed to ipl
m.j. akbar's write up, in your pages, on ipl's financial misdeeds, is the dirty 'tail' of the tale which finally emerged! very much like the old saying: "you can fool all the people for some time, and some people for all the time, but not all the people for all the time!" it was time out for ipl and their towering 'six' of a financial deal was caught at the boundary by agile fielders of the 'tax' team!
sirens
three types of moving vehicles use different types of sirens for emergency use: the police; the fire brigade; and the ambulance services. the codes for the police and the fire brigade are well written for centuries to avoid any confusion.
security of life
for people, the most lovable thing is life. but now in our country the security of life is threatened. if we take a look at everyday newspapers, we find out the unprecedented examples of life's insecurity in all parts of our motherland. in broad daylight a police inspector was killed by criminals, the kids are murdered for not getting ransom, the girls are committing suicide after being teased by stalkers.
importing films
in 1972, the government of the newly independent bangladesh banned all foreign movies in our cinema halls. the objective of that decision was to protect our bangla movies and artists.
green power
green power means both solar power and windmill for the generation of electricity from sunlight using photovoltaics (pv), or indirectly with concentrating solar power (csp), where the sun's energy is focused to boil water which is used to provide power. in bangladesh, the air is rich in water vapour. sunlight and water vapour for csp to produce electricity are available and it may be more efficient for solar power. solar power had the potential to provide over 1,000 times total world energy consumption in 2008, though it provided only 0.02% . the largest solar power plant in the world is the solar thermal plants producing 354 mw but recently multi-megawatt photovoltaic plants have been built. the 46 mw moura photovoltaic power station in portugal and the 40 mw waldpolenz solar park in germany are large photovoltaic power stations. recently, scientists proposed much larger ones, such as the 100 mw fort peck solar farm, the 550 mw topaz solar farm, and the 600 mw rancho cielo solar farm.
role model
i am not sure about the islamic schools like madrasas etc, where the young learners are imparted the knowledge of their role model or not, besides memorizing the holy koran. nevertheless, i have high regard for these islamic schools, that are frantically fighting for their existence in this hostile environment.
good manners
“my boy" a father advised his son, "treat everybody with politeness, even those who are rude to you. remember that you show courtesy to them not because they are gentlemen but because you are one.”
absurd democracy
a three-member team of bangladesh telecommunications regulatory commission (btrc) switched off the transmission of channel 1 on 27th april at around 6:30pm. in a democratic country, violators of the law must be brought to book, but approximately one thousand journalists and employees who are shedding tears for their survival, are innocent even if they are ignorant of violation of the law.
electronic resources in universities
this is in response to the news entitled “private universities run without fulfilling the criteria” published in your daily on 4 may 2010. may i bring to your notice that contrary to the news that only one private university maintains online databases, there are many other private universities which subscribe numerous electronic/online journals and books and have access to latest electronic resources.
indian plan
the indian government seems to be determined to go ahead with the mammoth national river linking project (nrlp) to link 14 himalayan rivers in the north and 16 peninsular rivers in the south of india without consulting co-riparian nations, bangladesh, nepal and bhutan. this displays total disregard for international norms and treaties by india. they also appear to be indifferent to the disastrous consequences of the project on the northern and north-eastern states of india. experts opine that connecting the peninsular rivers to the himalayan rivers would alter the natural drainage system of the entire region with severe adverse consequences. the proposed 40,000 km long inland waterways will also cause massive human displacement. india's well known environmentalist dr. vandana shiva thinks that no serious study has been done on the river linking project. the project has the potential to cause irreparable ecological and environmental damage including loss of biodiversity and wildlife and may also trigger seismic tremors.
