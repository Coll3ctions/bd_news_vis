food safety and bangladesh
talking of milk products and the inclusion of melamine in the formula are whims that need serious thoughts. i have a different perspective, i have to ask myself what are the acceptable levels in bangladesh? who decides these levels? who ensures these levels are rightly present in the milk or food item?
baul statues
thanks to ds for making lead news and writing a strong editorial on "baul statue" events. i do not know how this small number of "islamic fundamentalists" could take law in their own hands and dictate the issues of similar nature time and again. the ctg is playing a very dubious role in curbing the harmful activities of these fundamentalist groups. apparently, they are not only supporting but giving encouragement to fan up terror under the pretext of religion. the forum which talks about "mukti juddha" is in effect shielding these terrorists from the wrath of the general public who believe in freedom of choice, expression and individual rights.
mass killing in 1971
recently, the school of law of australian newcastle university organised a seminar on "bangladesh mass killing-1971". this year they incorporated mass killing in bangladesh in the 'public international law' course.
journalistic credibility
recently, i read a news item in one of our national english language dailies which reported killing of a rickshaw-puller rafiqul islam (35) by an influential person's associates just because the former's hands touched the latter's body. this unfortunate incident took place at adabor in the capital.
unconditional surrender!
bolstered by emergency powers, the caretaker government at one time appeared mighty powerful in their mission. wholehearted support of the army pushed their image to an enviable height. they arrested both the former prime ministers who still enjoy robust popular support. they were so sensitive to unlawful assemblies that a few political workers were arrested in sylhet while having their lunch at a fellow politician's home! they languished in jail for many months for their illegal (?) activities. in khulna a former state minister was arrested from a private house allegedly for playing cards. they were prosecuted. such examples of zero tolerance are abundant during the 19-month tenure of the ctg. we appreciated their firmness as the fallout of the great mission the ctg was going to accomplish.
religion and politics
at the outset, i will draw your attention to the news reports published recently in the daily star:
unprecedented vandalism
a news item was published in different dailies regarding the unprecedented massive vandalism at the vc office of dhaka university. how could they escape from the place without the law enforcers' trying to arrest them? the university authorities should take immediate action against the attackers to prevent repetition of such incidents in the future. there could have been a constructive negotiation between the authorities and the agitated students on the issue of admission handled by the respective departments.
simply outrageous
the outrageous activities of religious fundamentalists are increasing day by day. the photo showing some madrasa students trying to pull down the baul sculpture is only comparable to taliban activities.
power game
the caretakers and the political parties have come to an understanding after so much pulling of each other's legs. what deal they have made will be unfolded gradually in the days ahead. but the caretakers are making one great mistake by trusting these shrewd political people. the very moment the emergency goes, they will show their teeth and claws.
citizenship issue
i refer to the letter on this topic of 19 october. there are many confusing legal and practical interpretations of 'bangladesh dual nationality' . however, from my own experience i have learnt the following.
ominous developments
due to the current price hike of foods and other essentials, a good number of people have become poorer throughout the globe. the us and its allies are spending a huge amount of money on arms. many countries are using food grains for producing bio-fuel which is surely a great threat to human beings. dogs and other pet animals of rich countries are getting such foods which can save crores of people in the poor countries. the haves and have-nots are living in the same world. yes, allah, the almighty, has sanctioned someone fortunes and he will surely examine in the life hereafter how the rich used their wealth.
election 2008
the date of national election 2008 has been fixed. but is everyone getting ready for the election in a democratic style?
melamine in milk
melamine has been detected in many brands of baby milk powder. it has become the talk of the city and may be the country. the test reports are conflicting. the newspapers, tv media are hugely covering this news item since it has tremendous news value. people are 'eating' the news coverage quite voraciously. all the mothers are very worried, so are the fathers, brothers, sisters and so on. people are bewildered. they are at a loss what to feed the baby. in the mean while, so called 'fresh cow milk' sellers are making windfall profit from selling their 'cow milk'. a few years back, one 'dudhwalla' was supplying fifty litres of milk from a few cows. a friend of mine got curious and followed him to his house. he found that they were mixing powder milk in water, boiling it and later on mixing with fresh cow milk. it was sold as “khanti gorur dudh'!
controlling traffic
the steps necessary to control the congestion level in the city are described as follows:
hm ershad's interview
the ds is doing a good job by regularly publishing exclusive interviews of politicians. but not all facts were mentioned while interviewing hm ershad.
du incident
the report 'madrasa youths swoop on office of du vc' was published in an english language daily. view the page international
