utilisation of natural resources
a roundtable on our endangered power sector and what needs to be done about it in the national interest emphasises once again an issue of vital public concern. in the past many years, the inefficiency as well as corruption that has sapped the strength of the sector has left the country reeling from its effects, to a point where the nation is still paying a price. one cannot but agree with the participants, many of whom echoed the views of large sections of the public when they referred to improper utilisation of natural resources and unbridled corruption in the power sector as realities we must now contend with. with power shortage now well over 2000 megawatts, it is not unnatural that industrial production in the country will be directly affected.

the 'price' of high rice prices

day belongs to tigers
