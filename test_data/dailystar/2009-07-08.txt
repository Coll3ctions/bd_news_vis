felling of trees in sitakunda coastal belt
the stay order served by the supreme court in the matter of the recent razing of trees along the coastal belt in sitakunda stresses once more the need for firm action against those who seek to destroy the country's ecology. indeed, when a group of influential people cut down as many as 15,000 trees across a 40-acre forest belt in sitakunda in the last few days in order to build ship-breaking yards there, it became absolutely clear that the environment is still at risk from predatory elements. more significantly, when the emphasis in recent years has been on an expansion of afforestation along the sea belt owing to the frequency of natural disasters, the destruction of the trees is a clear affront to those, both in government and civil society, who have been involved in trying to make the coastal regions safer for those inhabiting it.

disaster management
bangladesh is a disaster prone country and has been suffering long with effects of various forms of natural disasters like, tornado, cyclone, frequent seasonal floods, tidal surges, earth sliding, earth quakes and incessant rains. the destruction and damage, economic, social and life losses resulting from these natural disasters are so big that these always hinder our economic growth and development and in many cases we have to depend on foreign aid support to survive.
biodiversity and our existence
it has been estimated that more than 50 million species of plants, animals and micro-organisms exist in the world. out of these, about two million organisms have been identified so far. our planet's requirement and services depend mainly on biological resources. human society depends on biological resources, their diversity and the ecosystem that sustain them. biological resources not only provide us nourishment, clothing, housing, fuel and medicine but also meet other requirements.
bus tickets
in dhaka city many bus companies maintain ticket counters from where people have to get on buses after buying tickets first. but many ticket sellers adopt a different way for their personal benefits. when a bus comes, people are in a hurry to enter into it but on receiving the money the seller instruct one or some passengers to board the bus without ticket. as the conductors and drivers get a portion of the non-issued tickets' money, the passengers generally do not face any problem in boarding the bus. i think some checkers are also involved in this act. if anyone insists on getting the ticket, the seller issues it angrily. the sellers do not do this illegal act for all passengers but they earn something in this way from around 10% of the passengers. it is my estimation.
new timing
the letter by rumi ahmed "torturous timing" is a very timely one.
digital bangladesh
digital society focuses on technology where information must be available to all classes of people. it is obviously forward thinking, especially for a poverty ridden and developing country like bangladesh. each and every sector of a society should be interconnected through ict. connecting people and ensuring good governance is a core prerequisite for a digital bangladesh. good governance includes different indicators like accountability of the government, transparency of the government, effective parliament, effective democratic system, freedom of print and mass media, independence of judiciary, rule of law, and access to information etc. effective implementation of the above indicators can be possible when society gets adaptation with ict. information should be exposed to mass people that can ensure true communication. connecting people depends on access to information.
country's security
every state has its own foreign policies. and many of them may not sound decent, but that's the way it is, completely unfathomable. of course it's not all about high government officials showing their ever-smiling faces in various summits and bilateral rendezvous. this never ever does not bring an end to the story, nor does it resemble the innumerable conspiracies and the vicious abhorrence for one another. but it's just a formality to save your skin in front of the world. so deep down, it's the intricate manifestation of national security that matters the most. a country helped the tamil tigers in sri lanka, named ltte, by providing them with sophisticated and advanced machineries to consolidate their roots and give the sri lankans a debilitating battle to fight. for decades now, it has also been facilitating the 'shanti bahini', which tended to give our bangladesh army a pulsating headache all the way in the chittagong hill tracts.
patriotism
george bernard shaw said “patriotism is the conviction that your country is better than others because you were born in it.” there have been many such writers, political activists such as leo tolstoy, emma goldman who have described patriotism as too narrow a concept to meet the necessities and ideologies of the working men and women of the world who believe in harmony. in one of her speeches emma goldman said patriotism justifies the killing of innocent human beings. do we all define patriotism as the right to kill in the name of one's country? the more important question is should we consider patriotism as the act of looking down upon all the other nations and overlooking the faults, atrocities committed by our own nation? let's not define patriotism in a way which allows politicians, influential people to manipulate us into considering the slaughter of harmless human beings as a noble cause.
ksa woman minister
appointment of a woman minister by the saudi king is a bold step towards ensuring women's development in the kingdom of saudi arabia (ksa). but it is most unfortunate that a certain quarter has been spreading some propaganda stating that the first ever appointed minister in the kingdom is under some restrictions to discharging her duties smoothly. but ms. norah binte abdullah al-fayez, deputy education minister for female education affairs, ksa vide a recent statement told that she is under no restrictions to perform her job as a minister.
tale of a child worker
a few days ago i visited bandarban, one of the lands of natural beauty, accompanied by some of my friends. we hired a four wheeler jeep to enjoy the tour smoothly. surprisingly, i met a child who was the helper/conductor of that jeep which climbs a number of hiils every day. undoubtedly, it was a risky job, but the boy performed spontaneously. when we reached the peak of a hill named neelgiri, 2400 feet above the sea level, i realized the pathetic condition of that child. i called him “pioneer” because he made me know about many attractive places and hills on the way to neelgiri. i couldn't resist my temptation to talk to him alone to know about his short but experienced life of sorrow and deep depression. i came to know that he grew up in a tribal family in bandarban. his father was a jeep driver. his mother was often brutally beaten by his drunken father. he had nothing to do but cry himself. once his mother was beaten brutally and divorced by his drunken father.
iranian democrats
reuel marc gerecht, a senior fellow at the foundation for defence of democracies and an expert on the middle east, recently wrote in international herald tribune: "as iranians have come to know theocracy intimately, secularism has become increasingly attractive. iran now produces brilliant clerics who argue in favour of the separation of church and state as a means of saving the faith from corrupting power."
too soft!
even though i do not support any political party, i support 110% the views expressed by the bnp parliamentary party regarding the interference of the indian high commissioner in our internal affairs. questioning our water experts in our own country is uncalled for, unacceptable and demands a harsh response. the utterances of our foreign minister are equally deplorable.
drivers or killers?
i fully share the views expressed by mr. rahat in your column on 22nd june on the subject. it is very unfortunate to see that the on duty traffic policemen are oblivious of the countless traffic violations that are being committed by the bus drivers of dhaka city particularly of some specific brands which have the most dented and dilapidated look of their so called public transport. because of heavy build and very shabby look of their vehicles they could not care less in damaging other vehicles ignoring all norms of traffic rules. not only the drivers are unruly their assistants are equally if not more unruly as they scream and shout at the small private cars for space at the miseries/panic of private car owners. the rule that says the slower vehicle should move on the left lane and all overtaking be done from right seems to be forgotten all the time. similarly, taking a right turn from left lanes has become a standard rule in this country. i wonder if the traffic police do know about these rules or if these rules have been written off from the book. i am pretty sure these route permit holders along with their accomplice drivers have an unholy alliance with the on duty traffic policemen who overlook all such violations in favour of personal gains.
