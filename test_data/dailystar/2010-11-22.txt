unsafe highways unsafe travel
our highways are veritable death traps that have over the years on the average taken more lives per year than in any other country. and we seem to be in a state of torpor when it comes to addressing this danger. statistics of the highway police indicate a figure of 510 deaths on the highways only in the first half of 2010. the figure is perhaps much higher considering the fact that many accidents do not get reported at all or are taken cognizance of by the police.
suu kyi moves cautiously
the newly freed aung san suu kyi has been giving out cautious signals of what she plans to do now that she is back in sunlight. while her release from long detention was surely a seminal event not only for the people of her country but also for the rest of the world, it was how she intended to make use of her freedom that became an important question for many. perhaps there was reason enough here for such a question. in her previous stints of fitful freedom, ms. suu kyi's refusal to go soft on the military junta ruling her country swiftly saw her back in lonely imprisonment. that as well as the feeling in a good many quarters that her idealism had all along been getting the better of her judgement may well have played a role in her present change of attitude. where earlier she was vociferously in favour of outside nations clamping sanctions on her country unless the regime relented, now she appears to have shifted ground just a little. view the page sports

what is logical is not legal what is legal is not logical!
having witnessed a full-day drama on the eviction of the cantonment house by the leader of the opposition begum khaleda zia, i realised the practical meaning of the saying, 'what is logical is not legal, what is legal is not logical”. perhaps the leader of the house could have intervened as a gesture of goodwill to assist her professional colleague, the leader of the opposition, bridging the gap between the legal and the logical requirements.
tourism planning
the current tourism planning in bangladesh, despite the potentiality, is yet to achieve satisfactory standards. if there were proper planning, reasonable level of development could have been achieve over the past years even with the government's meagre budgetary allocation.

victim of pm's insensitivity
at last sheikh hasina has completed her mission successfully by removing khaleda zia from her house. i think it was the most important mission of her political life. she is a prime minister, but after all she is a woman. she cannot work for a country without listening to her heart, and if she has a heart, then how has she removed khaleda from her home?

khaleda's eviction!
reading khaleda's eviction story, i feel ashamed of the political game being played in the country. just imagine, you have got rid of a widow from her house where she spent the best days of her life. her husband may have died long ago, but i am sure she used to cherish his memories in that house every day.

war crimes trial
the present government has committed to the people to complete the war crimes trial, but at present we see that the process is going on very slowly. this is likely to create doubts in people's mind whether the trial would be completed at all. we are waiting for the completion of trial of war criminals. and if that does not happen there will certainly be a disconnect between the present government and the general people of bangladesh. this may cost al dearly in the next election. so we hope that the al government will take adequate steps to compete the trial as early as possible.
we need true leaders

negligent officials
i have just received the dhaka city corporation holding tax bill book of 2010-2011 after the expiry of rebate date of 30th september 2010, due to negligence of somebody in the dcc, i believe. again, the bill book indicated total arrear of 2009-2010 though i have paid the tax at janata bank, mogbazar in august 2009. thus who is at fault - the bank officials or dcc authorities?
