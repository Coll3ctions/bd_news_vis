daylight murder in city
the murder of a local awami league politician and his chauffeur in the capital on wednesday is once more a grim reminder of the slide in law and order in the country. in these past few days, we have made our views known about the need to contain such spiralling crime if things are not to get any worse. we have pointed to the violent manner of young women being killed as well as the unnatural deaths of some children in recent days. and now that two murders have been committed in broad daylight in the capital, we cannot but serve warning to the authorities that unless serious and drastic steps are taken to halt this on-going spell of criminality, it may become well-nigh impossible for society to come away from the brink.
poor adp implementation
the annual development programme (adp) is still dogged by the perennial syndrome of low implementation rate. in keeping with an ambitious budget this fiscal, the adp allocation, too, was enhanced by around 36 per cent more than the revised adp for last fiscal. the expectation was that the ministries will be able to perform better at utilising the development money, given the emphasis the prime minister had repeatedly laid on better implementation of the fund. unfortunately though, this time, too, the utilisation rate, far from improving, has rather been marked by a poorer show at 33 per cent over the first seven months, which is less than that of the last year's 35 per cent during the corresponding period. view the page sports
from hope to expectation

simmons gives the players their due
 the name phil simmons, for older fans of the game, will conjure up images of a fierce west indian competitor who was part of the great west indian side of the late 80s and early 90s. since his last international game in 1999, simmons devoted his considerable experience to being an international coach, and led a plummeting zimbabwe till 2005. his prowess as a coach came to the fore, however, when he took over the reins of ireland for the 2007 world cup and guided them to the super eights stage in their first global tournament.

of tigers and leprechauns
the hour has come for bangladesh to open up its cricketing soul to the rest of the world. in its' own backyard, in the presence of multitudes who do not necessarily know one end of the bat from another, and who are certainly giving jingoism a whole new name. the first big game that is meant to matter the most beckons the tigers. it is crunchcrunchcrunch time and more besides. far from prying eyes across the seas the tigers had succumbed to the irish once before on the big stage. on home soil such a result again must surely be anathema. pressure, did i hear someone say? you bet your reverse sweep in the powerplay it is! irrespective of all the politically correct statements from the skipper and the coach.

call for action
excess and disequilibrium in any market is not sustainable overtime and what we have experienced in the capital markets recently is a painful price correction of an overpriced market to a large extent triggered by profit taking, de-leveraging by financial institutions to reduce exposure, some overreaction/panic selling as well as liquidation related to year end book closing by financial institutions. in my view, this is not at all unusual compared to the corrections experienced in many developing markets. since the market was up over 85 percent in 2010, a correction of 30-40 percent is just logical since 85 percent was not warranted based upon the fundamental growth of the economy and earnings of the listed companies.

bravo bangladesh
on february 17, i was going through an afp (agence france-presse) accredited news item published in the “saudi gazette” newspaper which appeared under the heading “bangladesh ready for opening gala”. i would like to reproduce below some of the lines from the above news item:
rickshawpullers rule
while watching a documentary on tv southasia yesterday, i was astounded to learn that a rickshaw puller on an average makes an amount equivalent to us$200 a month in dhaka and they have shot to such a fame that tv southasia aired a documentary on them for almost half an hour or so.

make room for forestry graduates
an advertisement of 31st bcs was published recently. one thing was noticeable that it invited applications from the graduates and post graduates of physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, soil science, environment science and forestry discipline for the post of bcs forest cadre. i think like other professional cadres, bcs forest cadre should be reserved only for the forestry graduates. forestry degree is also a professional degree like engineering, agriculture etc. this degree is awarded only by three public universities- khulna university, chittagong university and shylet university of science and technology in bangladesh. the students of forestry dept. study only forest related courses. they mainly learn how to manage forest, forest resources, and wildlife and so on.

poetry on tabla
i'm not a classical music connoisseur in the conventional sense; not claiming to be a specialist in the minute details of raga, taal and laye. appreciation for classical and semi-classical music has been an acquired taste. zakir hussain is a name i've been familiar with for as long as i can remember, but my true exposure to his musical prowess happened through the soundtrack of the film "saaz" [rumoured to be based on the sibling rivalry between lata mangeshkar and asha bhosle]. i listened in awe to the song "kya tumne hai keh diya"; particularly hussain's tabla and bol [interesting fact: the musician played a central character, opposite shabana azmi, in the film]. since then i've been a keen admirer of hussain's remarkable tabla skills. naturally, an opportunity to hear the maestro live made for a memorable evening.

world cup mania
“i'm a sports fanatic -- be it football or cricket. however, the latter manages to steal my heart more. i have previously enjoyed a good game in stadiums overseas. but this time around the world cup has reached our homes. i'll remain content within my four walls as my physical condition will not allow me to go to the venue to watch a game. however, addas have been planned as i had already told directors to keep my schedule free for game days. the passion and excitement have reached a new level as the tournament is at our doorsteps and i can't wait to hear sakib and his golden boys roar like tigers on the field. although the first match disappointed me a bit, i haven't lost hope yet. i don't know who will be crowned champions, but i sure wish that bangladesh will be able to lift the silverware this year. my second favorites are india. i was there at the stadium in malaysia when bangladesh won the icc trophy in 1997. the experience brought tears to my eyes and i hope for a repetition of such a feat”.

waiting is loss of living
