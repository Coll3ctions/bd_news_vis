post-verdict bnp politics
if ever there was a moment for bnp to introspect and seriously look within for a renewal of their party's politics, the time is now. it is true that the party is in disarray but it will be mistake to think that it has lost its capacity to play a major role in the future politics of bangladesh. there is no denying that bnp is facing perhaps the most serious crisis in its short but eventful life. but it is a crisis that the party has enough internal strength and public support for it to recover from.
university teachers playing truant
the move by the dhaka university authorities to recommend the dismissal of six teachers from service because of the latter's staying abroad and not reporting back for duty once more draws attention to an old issue. this is not for the first time that du has spoken of action against academics who, once they go abroad, at some point decide not to return home. there have been recurrent reports down the years of many of these teachers (there are exceptions, of course) finishing their higher studies abroad and then taking up employment there. the fact that not all of them may be taking up jobs at the university level, that in fact they might be veering off into other kinds of work, is irrelevant. what matters is that by not returning to their actual places of work, in this case dhaka university, they are certainly displaying a poor sense of responsibility to themselves and to their students. view the page sports

we should not forget them

provocation and persecution!
provocation and persecution, seems to occupy the major time and effort of our two major political parties, al and bnp; both headed by women at loggerheads with a "tit for tat" performance, based more on personal rather than political reasons. engulfed in this environment, they do not hesitate to ignore the rule of law, whenever in opposition. now one of the top bnp leaders, a lawyer of repute has advised and suggested to sort out all issues in street battles!

living in a polluted world

a sharp contrast
is gulshan / banani a piece of europe/usa in dhaka? a handful of people are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer day by day. when and how will we be able to follow and accept the article 19(2) of our sacred constitution, which says, 'the state shall adopt effective measures to remove social and economic inequality between man and man to ensure the equitable distribution of wealth among citizens and of opportunities in order to attain a uniform level of economic development throughout the republic?” how and when will we be successful in building a sonar bangla?

sufferings of commuters

juice packs
the other day my grandmother offered me to have a glass of mango juice. the juice was purely blended. just as i was about to sip it in, something caught my eyes. the glass was an ordinary small sized one and it contained a whole mango which only filled one fourth of it.
hostile remarks
it has come to my attention that a few atheists' remarks about religion are very hostile. i do not want to argue with these “intellectuals” on either the scientific compatibility of the qur'an or the fallacy of evolution. instead, i wish to take a different approach. if they are not concerned about religion, why are they the first ones to talk about it and spend time on it? sometimes, it seems like they need people to agree with them so that they feel a little less guilty (and more confident) about their assertions. there is so much hostility in their remarks directed to the muslims. their remarks are just creating greater division among people.

in his book, diplomacy, henry kissinger says that in the twentieth century no country has influenced international relations as decisively and at the same time as ambivalently as the united states. no society has more firmly insisted on the admissibility of intervention in the domestic affairs of other states, or more passionately asserted that its own values were universally applicable. that was precisely the foreign policy trend of the us in the twentieth century.
