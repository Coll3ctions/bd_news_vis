for a truly independent higher judiciary
a very senior lawyer and one whose comments and views receive a lot of public attention, recently made some serious allegations against our high court. for far less critical comments we in the media would have been hauled up for contempt, but that is a different matter, about which we reserve the right to talk another day.
the looming danger of population growth
the revelations made by the latest unfpa report are a very good reason why the government and indeed informed sections of society must sit up and take notice. population-wise, in a country of slightly more than 54,000 square miles we now have 16.44crore (or close to 161 million) people. it is clearly a stunning discovery, coming at a time when we thought population growth had tapered off and the nation could now go ahead in identifying the various ways by which the quality of life could be improved. our surprise comes in knowing that where the census of 2001 spoke of the population being 12.43crore, this jump by 4crore in just a decade is an unmistakable sign of how and where the national effort toward family planning and population control may have gone awry. the prospect of further rise in another decade or two at the current unbridled rate is simply a nightmare. view the page sports

all we need is a little power
in a series that ends in a whitewash, one would expect there to be a considerable difference between the number of runs each side scored from their respective batting powerplays. it makes sense that the winning team would dominate in that particular department. what one may not expect to find is that this difference would be in favor of the team on the receiving end of what in all other aspects, was a hiding.

hand wash and health
i am glad to come across the message of “global handwashing day”, four days prior to its celebration (on 15th october). i have realised the importance of hand wash by personally witnessing its ignorance among illiterate village people. illiterate parents do not prohibit their children to use dirty hands, while taking food. as our government has taken strong measures to expand education throughout the country, it is possible to propagate the message among the children of primary classes.
