the climate after cancun
the good news about climate and its changing patterns and how nations cope with it is that there is fresh new ground for hope. what has transpired in cancun is something quite removed from the stalemate and chaos which descended on copenhagen at this time last year. where miffed and shocked negotiators simply could not understand why nothing was working in copenhagen, this time around matters appear to be rather under control. there is certainly nothing of the dramatic sort that has occurred in cancun, of course, but after copenhagen there appears to have been a conscious effort made toward avoiding the old mistakes. view the page sports

“js body for reopening of 5 land phone companies” says the headline of a news item in the daily star on december 1. the parliamentary standing committee on the ministry of post and telecommunications (mopt) has resurrected a seemingly dead issue. one may recall that the networks of five locally owned pstn (public switched telephone network) operators (dhaka phone, national telecom, peoples tel, rankstel and worldtel) were shut down by the btrc in march this year on suspicion of being involved in illegal call termination business and subsequently their licences were cancelled in may. the standing committee immediately expressed its concerns over the drastic action taken by the btrc and decided to review the case. as such, it summoned the representatives of the operators, the officials of the btrc and the mopt to make their submissions and after having considered all the aspects including the significance and long term impact of the shutdown on the industry, it gave its recommendations to the mopt for taking initiatives for reopening of the networks. several months have passed since then, but the mopt has been characteristically inactive as if it were not their business at all.

chariots of fire
mr saleh ayub's regular letters on a variety of subjects are usually balanced and logical, but his latest effort on dhaka's rickshaws (tds, 08 dec), is very disturbing. this is my 80th letter to the ds on the subject in 3 years, where i have analysed the traffic imbroglio from all angles and suggested solutions to keep dhaka moving, but to no avail. if i had mr ayub's e-mail, i would send him uncensored copies of just 3 out of the 80, sent to ds on the dates mentioned, “rickshaw- free capital”-22/05/08, “facts on dhaka's jams”-29/10/09 and “dhaka sans rickshaws”- 19/04/10.

the profit and loss of noise
it is entirely appropriate that the man in charge of india's volume control, pranab mukherjee, should have uttered what is unarguably the comment of the year: our democracy has become too noisy. through a long career stretching from the 1960s, pranabda (as he is fondly known) has always preferred the brain to the lung. noise has been neither in his temperament nor his bhadralok-brahmin culture.
