ministers in self-critical mode
self-criticism and introspection, especially in politics, generally go a long way towards not only promoting the cause of democracy but also that of good governance. regrettably, it is a very rare phenomenon in bangladeshi politics. from that perspective, one cannot but appreciate the sentiments expressed the other day by two ministers about the performance of the year-old awami league-led government in certain areas of governance. both motia chowdhury, the agriculture minister, and abdul latif siddiqui, the jute and textiles minister, are senior figures in the government and, therefore, what they say on the issues is naturally taken seriously. in the present instance, they have not hesitated to be critical of the activities of their party men over the past year and at the same time have been courageous enough to acknowledge the drawbacks their government has suffered from.

balanced democratic growth
the basis of democracy is not maximum consensus. it is the tenuous middle ground between imposed uniformity and implacable hostility. in the process of the genesis of democracy, consensus enters at least at two points: (a) a sense of community that is above mere opinion and mere agreement, and (b) there must be a conscious adoption of democratic rules which enlarge step-by-step the area of consensus as democracy moves down its crowded agenda. view the page sports

global warming and development
with china bankrolling the u.s. budget deficits, it can provide $100 billion to other countries.
muharram and karbala
muharram is here once again. it is the first month of the islamic calendar. unlike other calendars the islamic year starts not with celebrations but with prayers and sermons remembering the martyrs of karbala. karabala in iraq was the place where the followers of islam, very small in number, in 61 hijri/680 a.d., led by hazrat imam hussain (as), the grandson of the prophet of islam hazrat muhammad (pbuh), confronted yazid's force which was opposed to the islamic teachings. his army was huge in number, well-equipped soldiers, cavalries and archers, personifying evil and tyranny, gathered on the banks of river euphrates. but the imam's handful of men were not deterred. on 10 muharram the decisive battle took place and these brave men, one by one, laid down their lives bravely and boldly embracing martyrdom. their sacrifice was to uphold and protect islam from the inimical and perverse force which was contriving against it, bent upon distorting and obfuscating the teachings of islam and replacing it with their brand of teachings which served their personal interests and solidified kingship and dynasty rule.
primary education
still now, many children have no access to education. there are more than 18 million children of primary school age (6-10 years) in bangladesh out of a total population of 137 million. almost half of them are girls.
two slogans
when i look back to this day of victory in 1971 (16 december 1971), it flashes before my eyes hundreds of freedom fighters entering dhaka city with arms up in their hands and joy bangla, joy bangabandhu in their thunderous voices. but the slogan that contributed to the birth of this nation was let to sink into oblivion only after four years of our victory.
deforestation
deforestation is now an issue of major concern. deforestation has become so indiscriminate that it will not be surprising if bangladesh turns into a desert very soon. it is like cutting the branch of a tree on which we are sitting. this is happening when everybody is worried about climate change and we know deforestation is one of the reasons behind further warming of climate.

reopening of closed mills
the prime minister has indicated that the closed jute mills might be reopened when sramik league stalwarts called on her on the occasion of foundation day of the sramik league. similar declaration of opening of closed mills was given by the industries minister, just after taking charge of the ministry. unfortunately, nothing tangible could be perceived till date regarding restart of chittagong steel mills, though this lone mill in the steel sector was closed between 1996-2001 and the industries minister of the present government hails from chittagong. it is needless to describe the importance of steel, and reopening the lone steel mills should be a priority for the government, i believe.

cheating by shopkeepers
every day a large number of people go to dhaka city markets to buy essential food items to meet their household needs. invariably, each shopkeeper gives less quantity for each purchase to every buyer. hence, for every purchase the buyer is cheated at least by 100 grams or more.
give me a job
december 29, 2008 was a great victory day for the al and the people. the majority of people supported the al. as a first time voter, i also dreamt of a better life. but it is to be remembered that a huge number of people are unemployed. they have no job. so, the government should recruit every unemployed capable person as pledged by the ruling party's election manifesto. it is difficult to give everyone a job, but not impossible.
transport system
a few years back a good transport system was seen in the streets connecting all most all the corners of the city. buses like premium, nirapad & volvo along with other buses used to serve to the satisfaction of the commuters. but to our utter surprise, premium & nirapad buses discontinued & the last blow for the people came from withdrawal of volvo buses to uttara point. more & more comfortable buses have to be put into service. yes, the authorities should do it on a priority basis to mitigate the present intolerable sufferings of the people.
road safety
on 6 december, i was shocked to see a picture in your newspaper, showing how a mother with her child were crossing the road near a speeding cng auto-rickshaw. that time they were on the zebra crossing. there are thousands of school going children who attempt to cross the road in a most hazardous situation. children are our national assets. if we cannot give them safety and provide congenial atmosphere, how do we expect to leave good citizens for future? the developed and many other underdeveloped countries strictly follow the traffic rules, especially for children. it is most unfortunate that there is no such law in this country for children where they are exposed to traffic hazards.
house rent
about 60% people of dhaka city live in rented houses. most of them are service holders whose monthly income is very limited. more than half their salary is given as house rent. with the rest they manage somehow their domestic affairs. but the house-owners increase the house rents once or twice a year without any genuine reason. as a result, the people with fixed income suffer.
irrigation
dr. roy's informative and very appropriate write-up, published in your science & life page on 8th.december; should be followed up vigorously at the farming level; mobilising all resources of the government, so that it is put into practice as early as possible. all methods of publicising this technique should be mobilised in all our audiovisual media.
the mangrove forests
it is well known to all of us that the sundarbans is the leading mangrove forest in the planet. the term sundarbans can be literally translated as : “beautiful forest.” there is a myth that the name might have originated from the sundari trees that are available in sundarbans in great numbers. on the other hand, it has been anticipated that the name is a corruption of samudraban ("sea forest") or chandra-bandhe (name of an ancient ethnic group). however, the commonly established analysis is the one connected with sundari trees.
savar bus-stand
the condition of the road at savar is deteriorating day by day. road accident is very common in this city. traffic police have no control at all. often the vehicles run on the wrong side at good speed. it is unimaginable that even the buses too run in the wrong side. how long can it continue? the situation of savar bazar is horrible. rickshaw-puller to car driver, nobody pays any heed to traffic rules. though every day a huge number of people go to dhaka, yet there is no bus-stand. the situation worsens in the rainy season. while entering into the bus, people often try to defeat each other. can't the bus operators form a queue? because of crp, a huge number of foreigners come to savar. their experience on the road is not good at all.
stop harassment
