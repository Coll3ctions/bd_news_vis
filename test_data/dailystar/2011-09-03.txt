royal bengal tiger: threatened species
the majestic royal bengal tiger is roaming near the brink of extinction. once, the tiger ruled over a major part of the globe ranging from the pacific to the black sea and from ural mountains to the mountain agung. it is an irony of fate that tiger is facing an onslaught of poaching throughout its range. the main factor contributing in the decline of cat population is habitat degradation. but poaching has put them in a vulnerable condition to survive. right now tigers occupy only 7% of their historic range and they live in small islands of forests surrounded by a sea of human beings. over the past few centuries tigers lost more than 80% of their natural habitats and what remain are only small fragments under heavy anthropogenic pressure.

faiz . . . in the light of the moon
the poet and lyricist javed akhtar speaks for many when he links faiz ahmed faiz's poetry to lunar gleam. there is magic in the moon, says akhtar. wherever its light falls --- on ponds, on deserts, on homes, on flowers, on fallen twigs --- it envelopes the object of its brilliance in beauty. and so it is with faiz's poetry. it acts as a transformational force on the themes it deals with. it underscores the power of poetry to create the sublime and then bring it into the lives of people. it is just as well. in this centenary year of faiz ahmed faiz's birth, it becomes necessary to recall the fervour and the commitment he brought to urdu poetry and in the process enhanced the quality of a genre that in earlier times was enriched at various points by mirza ghalib, mir taqi mir, bahadur shah zafar and allama iqbal. and, of course, by so many others.

bohemian memories
was it the spirit of good people or the good spirit that allowed for celebration of goodness in people? whatever it was, the harmony between laughter and chopin's fantasie impromptu was blending well. she was sitting under the blue sky in the middle of verdant green of a winery cleansed and freshened by the previous day's rain shower. the twilight was fused with amber warmth. the hint of slight fragrance in the air came from the south side of the pond where the dense foliage of honeysuckle was growing wild and left untouched. it was empyrean beauty. she sat still, closing her eyes, while savouring the blended crescendo of wind, music and laughter, but not words. hers is the boundary that crosses speech into silence. in it she finds an outpouring of self through the compulsion to reach within, a kind of oblivion to her history of becoming. it is a terrain on which she has come to depend as some kind of transcendence to the sprinklings of finding her real self. view the page star health

there is much about africa that we do not know. yes, there are the civil wars and the pogroms that we are pelted with day after day through the media. the tales of corrupt, venal dictators and of the murderous nature of men, as in the rwanda genocide of 1994 or the post-independence happenings in the congo in the early 1960s, are what have kept us bound to the thought that africa is a synonym for chaos. that is a mistaken belief, for africa is a place, a continent like any other. nature has endowed it with beauty. its people, part of its innumerable tribes, have kept life going in the way their ancestors did long ago.
