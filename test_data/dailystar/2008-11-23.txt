sheikh hasina and begum zia meet !
it is quite a statement on our political realities when news comes in that sheikh hasina and begum khaleda zia have finally met each other and have exchanged pleasantries. but that is what they, as the foremost political personalities of the country, are supposed to be doing anyway. that they have not met or have not talked for a long time in the way modern politicians should is an embarrassment not only for them but for all of us in this country as well. it is only normal practice for politicians of their stature to be in constant contact with each other and keep themselves in touch with the objective realities around them. the fact that screaming newspaper headlines greet readers about their rare meetings only shows the levels of poverty to which politics has sunk in bangladesh. and poverty is in the way the chiefs of the awami league and the bangladesh nationalist party have effectively transformed adversarial politics into deep personal animosity.

light in the heart of darkness
there are numerous unflattering epithets for africa, of course the most prominent of which is the 'heart of darkness', from the eponymous novel by joseph conrad. the dark history of apartheid in south africa, the scare of yellow fever in central africa, the 60 percent hiv prevalence in swaziland (highest in the world), the horrific genocides of tutsis and hutus in rwanda, mass starvations in sudan are just a few headlines that define our perception of africa -- the so-called 'dark continent'. so when a couple of months back i was invited by the international trade center (itc), a geneva-based un organisation dedicated to promoting exports from developing countries, to attend a services exporters network meeting in south africa's commercial capital johannesburg, i immediately accepted. the lure of africa -- the mystique, the fear, the legacy -- was overwhelming.

melamine free powder milk
we agree that there is no substitute of breast-feeding for human baby. but in practice when a baby does not get enough milk, we have to arrange for supplementary food suitable for a baby. cow's milk is the best supplementary baby food known to us. in bangladesh scarcity of cow's milk is an established fact. the government has imposed excess customs duty, vat and supplementary duty to encourage production of milk in the country but in last two decades no significant development has been achieved. very insignificant quantity of milk is produced here.

tigers & smith's comments
this is in reference to the sports article dated 11nov08 where it was reported that the tigers were angered by the south african captain's (smith) comments. in my personal view, smith was absolutely right. the so-called tigers should learn how to take criticism in a positive and constructive way and improve on their game. winning one game once in a blue moon does not show any signs of improvement or prove anything. i think the tigers should stop crying about smith's comments, get their acts together and start producing results because this indeed is not good for cricket.
thakurgaon airport
thakurgaon is one of the northern districts of bangladesh. it is beside panchagarh, the northern-most district of bangladesh. there is an airport in thakurgaon but most of us do not know about that. the airport is located at shibganj in thakurgaon. during the 80's it was used as a domestic airport. but afterwards, for the lack of air passengers and maintenance facilities it was closed down. but now the situation has changed. the income level and standard of living of thakurgaon people have improved considerably. their capability in earning has also increased. normally it takes eight hours to go to dhaka by bus. it also takes many hours to go by railway. so, the local people feel the reopening of the airport. it is to be mentioned here that thakurgaon is a district of economic possibilities and opportunities, therefore it is expected that the respective authorities will take necessary steps to make the airport ready for operation.

telephone operator

rickshawpullers
rickshaw is a favourite form of transport both in cities and rural areas. rickshaw cannot create much problem in rural areas as the number of vehicles is less there. but in cities, rickshaws cause traffic jams. rickshawpullers believe that road rules are not for them to abide by. so they pull their vehicle however they fancy, without showing any concern for safety. during rough weather like rain or storm they charge exorbitant amounts. again, during school, college or university time they ask for double the fare. in such cases girls become the worst sufferers as they do not jump on a rickshaw like the boys or bargain with a loud voice.
scientists in politics
national election is expected to be held very soon in bangladesh. names of possible candidates with their short profiles are coming in the newspapers. as a conscious citizen and voter of the country, i believe i have every right to comment, criticize and advise the politicians who are going to take responsibilities of serving the nation as members of parliament which is a very sensitive and important position. some of them will take responsibilities as ministers of the government of the peoples' republic of bangladesh as well. it has been observed from newspaper report that very few women are participating in election, though the male candidates are coming from different educational and professional backgrounds. it has also come to my notice that very few scientists and technologists are taking part in the upcoming election.
revenue policy
to make government's revenue policy adequate, i think govt. should give emphasis on revenue from land. land may be divided into several categoriesa such as commercial land, industrial land, residential land and agricultural land. revenue rate of agricultural land should be least whereas, business and industrial land revenue should be high. calculating on the basis of total land government should impose tax on landowners. income tax rate should be uniform and should be minimum as a result tax-paying attitude of people will grow. vat policy should be discarded because it created scope for misuse and corruption. income tax rate should not exceed 10%. tax on industrial land, commercial land, business land should be higher than that of agriculture land. i hope the government will think about this matter.
bsf jawan

ashraful's consistency
they say, form is temporary but class is permanent. ashraful just proved the saying again. although his batting was not up to the mark in the test series against new zealand, his performance in the odis was decent and consistent. and now in south africa he just played a genuine innings in the first odi. he also started well in the t-20 match against south africa before throwing his wicket away. in the first odi, he played some glorious shots that remind us what he is capable of. recently, his batting style was under a lot of criticism. the batting form he is starting to regain will stop all criticism. let us hope he becomes consistent from now on. view the page international
