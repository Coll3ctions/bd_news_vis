keeping anti-women policy elements at bay
the tough stance adopted by the government on the extremists' response to the proposed national women development policy seemingly prevented any untoward incident on friday. we only wish the government had acted thus sooner. but now that the extremist elements opposed to the policy have drawn back from the threats they made earlier about opposing the policy, we feel the government should keep up the pressure on them and see that they are no more able to disrupt social order in the name of religion. in the last few weeks, motivated controversy has been generated around the provisions of the proposed women policy. we note that despite reassurances by the government that none of the provisions goes against koranic principles, a section of the religious right has continued to misguide the public.

a lesson for south asia

regulating the us financial market
there is no doubt that the recent sub-prime mortgage meltdown has led to a collective loss of faith in the way the united states financial system works. when the turmoil in the sub-prime market spread to other parts of the securities market it created a huge liquidity crisis, forcing the central banks on both sides of the atlantic to pump billions of dollars into the system to create liquidity. yet, in spite of these efforts, confidence in the credit market has remained shaky. financial institutions are still hesitant to extend new credits. view the page sports

kaptai lake watershed: agro-ecosystem management constraint
in spite of getting diverse interests of commissioning power plant at kaptai in chittagong hill tracts, its ecological consequences were many-fold. firstly, the population pressure increased in the vicinity of the kaptai lake for swallowing most of the best valley-bottom land and consequently there was an acute shortage of suitable cultivable land. secondly, competition for jhum land increased so greatly that the fallow cycle has been reduced and the natural system of soil conservation became fragile. thirdly, destruction of the forest exposed the ground surface to the rainwater and the traditional slash and burn techniques resulted in incessant soil loss, depletion of plant nutrient, competition from weeds and yield decline. such widespread land degradation manifests itself in a declining rural income, fuel wood shortage and silting up of the kaptai reservoir. the changes have also greatly increased the fire hazard, environmental pollution, wild life depletion, scarcity of safe drinking water. therefore, the long-term sustainability of hill land agriculture in the watershed area of kaptai lake is obviously threatened in terms of productivity and ecology.
freshwater: a finite but renewable resource
water, a critical component of the ecological cycles, is theoretically a renewable resource, made continually available -- through the water cycle -- by the constant flow of solar energy to the earth, which evaporates water from the ocean and redistributes it back to the globe as precipitation. as the world population increased, the water demand continued to rise and the per capita availability of freshwater continued to decrease. about 70 percent of the earth's surface is covered with water, but only 2.53 percent of that is freshwater, the rest being saline. again, most of this freshwater is locked in ice and snow in glaciers and ice sheets. only 0.26 percent of all freshwater stock (about 90,000 cubic km of water in absolute terms) is globally available to us for use -- from rivers, lakes, soil moisture and groundwater; apparently the quantity is not so small for a world population of 6.4 billion. in reality, however, we (humankind) are living at the mercy of the water cycle, which acts as the bloodstream of the biosphere. view the page literature

military application of satellites
man's curiosity about the 'heavens' dates back, perhaps, to the beginning of history. initially he fulfilled a desire to see into the depths of space by using telescopes but the ultimate desire has been to launch himself into space. this required understanding of the laws governing the motions of bodies around the planets. johannes kepler and isaac newton worked out the mathematical laws that govern the motion of bodies in orbit round the heavenly bodies. the laws of motion and the basic notion of differential calculus opened the door to the technology of artificial earth satellites.
the arab summit and the us doctrine
the arab summit, which was held on the 29th and 30th of march, 2008 in damascus, syria, faced serious regional challenges. this annual summit is usually held in a different arab capital. the current damascus summit was defined by the failure to attend by saudi arabian, egyptian, jordanian and lebanese leaders. these four countries made a tragic and strategic mistake by failing to attend the summit. they will become more vulnerable to arab national voices, which will perceive them as collaborators with the united states.

to both its critics and backers, globalisation is a phenomenon to be seriously studied and debated. and when leading experts like nobel laureate joseph stiglitz and jagdish bhagwati, representing the two sides of the debate respectively, are brought together in a single volume, one can expect a lively and state-of-the-art discourse on the subject. a recently published high profile book offers exactly just that a reasoned and sophisticated update on the debate about the benefits, risks and future prospects of globalisation.
the invisible bonds between people
the hundred secret senses makes one comprehend the hidden resources within each one of us. we all have senses that are many in number, buried deep within our psyche, that we are often not aware of. we all experience gut feelings; we are able to sense that which is not obvious to our ordinary senses.
values and the young
all teaching is a matter of involvement. ask anyone who has been a teacher, especially in a school. there is the likelihood of your coming by a recapitulation of a sense of values, those which in these more uncertain times seem to be falling by the wayside. it just so happens that angela robinson is one individual who has held fast to those values even as they constantly appear to be slipping from our grasp. and she does so through informing the young she has been teaching in bangladesh for a good number of years now that the classroom is but a window to the world beyond it. and that world is of course an appreciation of the truths and the beliefs we have always held dear, for the simple reason that they have underpinned our hold on politics, on history, indeed on the diversity of culture that has kept society in a state of stability for generations on end.
synoptic tale of a culture struggle
