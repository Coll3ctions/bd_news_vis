swine flu preparedness needs updating
with a hundred and sixty-three reported cases of swine flu in the country since the affliction in mexico made international news almost over quarter of a year ago, the rate of incidence in bangladesh may not have been scary. yet, what needs to be noted is that in the recent days there has been a sharp increase in the number of identified cases. an added concern could be the possible number of unreported cases that has evaded screening. according to experts therefore, all this is a cause for worry for a country that is densely populated and having plenty of open crowded places where people mingle or come in close contact with each other making them vulnerable to contagion.
merkel's call for freeze on jewish settlements
german chancellor angela merkel's call for israel to freeze its settlements in palestinian territory is a powerful indication of the pressure which israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu is under. it is just as well that netanyahu be under such pressure because of the particular reason that he has so far given no indication of his willingness to go for accommodation with the palestinians. and the pressure is not just ms. merkel's. the obama administration too has been trying to convince israel's leader that progress in the middle east is eventually dependent on whether or not his government is ready and willing to put an end to its settlements in the region. unfortunately, and in defiance of objective reality, mr. netanyahu has chosen to look away from the issue.
poverty the yet untamed horse
poverty alleviation being an area of major policy thrust of the successive governments this year's asian development bank (adb) poverty figures for bangladesh have come as a shocker. the figures show that more than 50 percent of the population are now living below the extreme poverty level. to measure extreme poverty, the amount of income of a person that the poverty researchers in the un have agreed upon is equivalent to $1.25 per day. so, if one is to go by the adb-supplied figures, then the progress the country has made so far is very poor given the amount of emphasis laid on the issue by the different governments and the concern expressed by the donor communities.

reconstitution of bdr
the carnage and massacre committed in the bdr headquarters in pilkhana on the 26th february definitely called for an immediate investigation into the matter and suggestion for future course of action regarding its restructuring. the js panel constituted for the purpose has already submitted a list of suggestions for its remodelling and restructuring. i appreciate the panel for doing the hard work for preparing the suggestions. but i cannot agree with the suggestion of curtailing the bdr manpower by 30 percent. decreasing the manpower by 30% will mean a reduction of more than 12,000 personnel. if this suggestion is implemented several problems might arise. firstly, a huge number of able-bodied persons with modern military training will remain unemployed.

corruption
bangladesh is a developing country, and by definition, poor. the state and society both have to cope with severe socio-economic and political pressures, such as a chronic scarcity of resources, unpredictable political changes and needs associated, frequently, with post-colonial upheavals, as well as the intervention of outside forces which bring with them alien ideas and often alter the dynamics of the country. these circumstances, accompanied by wide disparities in income distribution and the needs of vast numbers of people who survive under conditions of extreme poverty, add a new dimension to the prevalence of corruption.
soul cleansing
the month of ramadan is the month souls are purified. the social scientists studying ethics believe that acquiring ideal sublime and ethical conscience passes through three stages:
communication problem
south khararchar is a vegetable producing area of dhamrai upazila under dhaka district. this area is not far from dhaka city, but there is no good road communication with the city.
optimum world population
a uk news report ( 17 aug) mentions that sir david attenborough has recently joined as patron the optimum population trust (uk) , and along with many other environmentalists and scientists are calling for a campaign to limit the world's population. prominent supporters of this call are jonathan porritt ( former uk government environmental adviser), long standing population control advocate paul ehrlich, and professor chris rapley, a british scientist who has suggested that the world's population be cut by two thirds.
osds
the acronym osd stands for officer on special duty. it means the osd officers are supposed to engage in a special kind of duty which ordinary officers cannot do. special duty may be an assignment of project appraisal, or project preparation, giving special training to a group of officers, some kind of research work, pursuing higher degree abroad, etc. but the practical meaning of osd in our government (excepting sending abroad) is to keep someone out of his job. in other words, it is a kind of silent punishment. the mechanism does not bring any good results, rather it creates acute frustration among the sufferers, sap their morale, humiliate them to the family and society as a whole. the money and the facilities spent for them is mere wastage.
fake beggars
some able-bodied people are found pretending to be lame, blind or dumb or some healthy beggars collect a false certificate or prescription and pretend to be patients. they beg in front of shopping malls, in universities and in vehicles. they emotionally blackmail the students and people for getting alms. thousand of street children are also begging during daytime. those children are sent to the streets by their parents after coaching to earn some extra pocket cash, though they are not actually poor.
diplomats
i have just returned from a 10-day trip to dhaka after four and a half years. there were many pleasant surprises in terms of positive developments; the energy i noticed in the streets and the infusion of a sense of purpose with which the 16 million city dwellers seemed to go about their day says volumes about the growing economy despite the political and administrative incompetence of the country's leaders and civil servants. the inside of zia international airport was most impressive. the $10bn remittance sent by expat workers is having an effect on the way of life in bangladesh. the traffic alas is the bane of dhaka!
traffic congestion
i was moved very much with the volume of news reports and photographs published in different dailies and also with the emotional outburst of dhaka metropolitan police commissioner shahidul huq in a recent meeting(20-08-09) held under the chairmanship of communications minister syed abul hossain telecast on tv. the full video of shahidul huq's speech was though not telecast on tv but the thrust of his contention was clear enough to the audience.
js panel & du violence
the parliamentary standing committee on the education ministry rejected the judicial probe report on the campus violence that took place on aug 20, 2007 on dhaka university campus by terming the report "inadequate and irrelevant". i also believe the three-day violence was state sponsored . well, ministries are accountable to pscs, but may i ask how a judicial probe report is rejected by a psc without reviewing it?
some important projects
time & tide wait for none. this proverb should be applicable for those who run the country. seven months have already been blotted out but no sign of development in any sector is visible.
the holy month
the arabic word ramadan is derived from 'ramad' which means - to burn or to destroy something by fire. the holy month of fasting is called ramadan, as during this revered month the muslims as a whole blaze all sorts of offensive acts including jealousy, evil propensity, bluffing, hostility and so on.
adviser's comment
in new york on august 20, 2009 an adviser to prime minister sheikh hasina said "the government has made no decision on the abolition of the caretaker government system."
ground reality
with the changing face of economy and education, there is a growing need for stronger industry-academia interface. there is a perceivable difference between classroom teaching and industry requirements. in bangladesh, industry requirements move at a fairly fast pace. however, the pace of change in academics is relatively slower. while the syllabi get updated over periods spanning over five to 10 years, the industry evolves in a matter of few months, so does its resource requirements. hence, faculty development and teaching modernisation have to be accelerated so that a young population can make the most of the industry opportunities. some of the areas in which the gap exists include lack of quality faculty, lack of high quality ict and connectivity infrastructure. the curriculum needs to be overhauled. there is a need to introduce application-oriented learning with meaningful exercises so that academic learning becomes relevant when students join industry. the focus on research areas should be on a par or ahead of the global innovation pace. moreover, higher education in bangladesh does not focus on soft skills (verbal or written communication, working on interpersonal skills and team collaboration), which should be a priority. higher education reform should be given utmost importance in terms of policy as well as implementation at the university level. public-private partnerships in higher education can play the role of a catalyst. specific opportunities abound in areas of faculty development, skill development and curriculum changes where industry partners can provide knowledge, expertise and support to address gaps.
