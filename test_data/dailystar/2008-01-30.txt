ill-gotten wealth of titas employees and officers
on the face of it, the news that 126 employees and officers of titas gas have promised to return their ill-gotten wealth, amounting to nearly tk. 400 crore, to the state exchequer, should cheer everyone. the task force has done a good job there. now that these titas gas people, of whom a staggering 118 are meter readers turned property owners in bizarre fairy tale fashion, are prepared to give back all that wealth to the state, we can only reflect on all the rags to riches stories that we have seen take shape in recent times.
environment merits priority attention
it can hardly be overstated that but for the hue and cry raised by civil society leaders and paribesh an-dolon activists over encroachment on our rivers, lakes and parks we would hardly have been aware of the environmental hazards involved. the expropriation of public lands including forest resources by professional land grabbers and poachers managing impunity to legal action during successive governments left the nation poorer on many counts. huge acreage of land went into wrongful possession diminishing space for development projects as tree cover dwindled and the natural drainage channels got clogged.

future of pakistan
i write with reference to the letter from mr. mahmood elahi titled "future of pakistan." while it is true that extremism and sectarianism pose a serious challenge to pakistan, i disagree with the author's assertion that "al-qaeda / taliban enjoy considerable support amongst the masses" of pakistan, a deduction reached by the author by pointing to bin laden's supposed "popularity" in pakistan. i believe the results of opinion polls suggesting "support" for bin laden need to be investigated thoroughly before reaching any firm conclusion as to their findings.

unsavoury souvenirs
the government needs to make fresh guidelines to create awareness among tourists, both local and foreign, against purchasing and exchanging wildlife souvenirs made from the endangered species.
inspection & qc culture
the ruling regimes since 1972 failed to introduce discipline and transparency in our inspectors and inspection networks. it means r&d and qc (research and development; and quality control) were wasteful expenditures; especially for goods and services not exported (like rmg and manpower exports). the local consumers have been suffering, being offered shoddy goods and services. this type of systems losses are huge over the decades, tarnishing the image of bangladeshi products and services.
school calendar
the recent hurricane-strength sidr has made obvious the need for a flexible school calendar in disaster-prone areas; but it is as well necessary in many other regions across the country. though all our education commissions have recommended decentralization of the education system, the right for scheduling one's own school calendar has been overlooked all along. it is however known that the district primary education officers had certain number of holidays in their hands to give to local schools until it was revoked, maybe, towards the end of the 1980s. again, on 22 april 1998 in a meeting at then primary and mass education division (pmed) a decision was taken for some flexibility in local school calendar with due permission from the division.
cancel quota system
the caretaker govt has taken myriad steps for reforming and reconstituting various govt organisations including the public service commission (psc) as the organisations have plunged into corruption and irregularity. the govt successfully reconstituted the psc, which is the highest recruiting body of govt officials and the steps taken were lauded by all. the caretaker govt has also taken the initiative to bring about changes in the psc recruitment process, so that the meritorious candidates could get chance. the measures would deter mischievous and fraudulent candidates who enter govt service using loopholes in the recruitment process. recently, while reading ds, i came to know that the committee, formed to bring changes in the process, is indifferent towards taking any initiative regarding the quota system.
a timely warning!
this is perhaps for the first time that the finance adviser warned scheduled banks not to harass their clients. in fact , we expected such a dictum from the bangladesh bank. as the central bank, bb's role, we expect, should be much greater. we observe that banks are earning a lot of money. we request all banks to provide on-line banking services and take care of clients' account accurately, send their balance regularly, include adequate precautions about the safety vault and lockers and honour every customer as a valued one.
climate change
it has been said in the un report that the world's climate is undergoing significant changes. if the world's temperature changes drastically many living beings may face extinction! the sea level is rising day by day. bangladesh is located at a very dangerous point. we should make all-out efforts to keep the situation under control.
wasa clearance certificate
through your daily we would like to draw the kind attention of the authorities concerned that many consumers/customers have not received the yearly clearance certificate of payment of their monthly desa and wasa bills for the last two years, as yet.
introducing essential rules
to develop our overall standard in different sectors of the state, we need some rules-regulations and their appropriate execution. but unfortunately the political governments didn't perform those tasks effectively, though they were vocal always in favour of those rules. for example, “separation of the judiciary” has been a long standing demand. but in 36 years they have done nothing meaningful. they have deferred it by showing lame excuses like red-tapism, bureaucratic complexity etc. but now we are encouraged. this government has initiated a lot of good things. they have made the ec, acc, psc, ugc, hrc and other organisations effective. but the challenge is to make these corrections institutionalised. otherwise, future political governments will attempt to make the ventures futile.
surma-kushiyara project
i felt very sad after reading the report about the above-mentioned project which was published in your paper on 30 december 2007. the information that the project is not being implemented properly due to the apathy of the officials concerned is very unfortunate. the frequent downward revision of the budget is proof that it has not been formulated properly. most of the croplands of the projects area are haors (flat low land) suitable for growing only one crop in winter (mostly boro rice) but rice crop is damaged by floods, partly or wholly, almost every year. this has been happening from the time immemorial. view the page international
