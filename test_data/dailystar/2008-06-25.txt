transport fare anarchy
ever since last saturday's tragic incident in which a passenger belonging to a city hospital was pushed over a fare row by conductor of a running bus on to the street to be only fatally run over, things have hardly improved in the city transport sector. on the contrary, commotion among passengers resenting arbitrary fare hikes by transport operators has led to brawls, vandalism and loss of property.
our stranded workers in kuala lumpur
the difficulties in which 32 bangladeshi workers have found themselves in kuala lumpur raise once again the issue of what is yet not being done to ease the plight of our citizens abroad. we have earlier and on a number of occasions drawn the attention of the authorities here in bangladesh about the paramount need to ensure that recruiting agencies follow rules and norms aimed specifically at ensuring the welfare of bangladeshis sent abroad to work in various firms. while we realise that a good number of such agencies have indeed been operating on the basis of standard procedures, there have been quite a few others which have not exactly been above board in their dealings with the workers they send abroad. at the same time, we think it is time to inquire into the workings of the overseas firms responsible for the shoddy deals with local recruitment agencies regarding our workers.
these are not momentous times . . .
we are living through some rather interesting times. these are not momentous times and we are surely not making history that could leave an enormous impact on our future. but, yes, these are interesting times, and just as well, and they are because of everything that is happening and, conversely, for everything that is not happening. a former prime minister has flown out of prison and out of the country. another insists that she will stay in it, but that should be no reason for her incarcerated children not to make it abroad for medical treatment.

mr. obama's washington
the life of a young senator in washington can be lonely. after winning a senate seat from illinois in 2004, barack obama became a part-time bachelor. he lived three or four days a week in a one-bedroom apartment a few blocks from the capitol. he worked all day, and at night he missed his daughters and his wife, michelle, left behind in chicago. "i have chosen a life … that requires me to be gone from michelle and the girls for long stretches of time and exposes michelle to all sorts of stress," obama wrote in the audacity of hope . "rationalisations seem feeble and painfully abstract when i'm missing one of the girls' school potlucks because of a vote, or calling michelle to tell her that session's been extended and we need to postpone our vacation." view the page sports

students going abroad
at present it is a very common phenomenon that most of the talented students of our country are keen to go abroad for the sake of a better living in the name of education. we can guess it if we see the long queues of students in front of foreign embassies. there is hardly anyone who can accomplish higher education in a foreign university because of high educational expenses. so they do odd jobs.
overbridge
an overbridge for the pedestrians is essential in busy roads. the main objectives of constructing such overbridge are to enable the pedestrians to cross the road safely, ensuring that no mishap takes place, creating provision for smooth traffic system, no waiting for crossing, and last of all, making life easier etc. but the truth is that many of our pedestrians have forgotten the objectives.
water pollution
i would like to salute the daily star for the june 15 news “river void of life forms” and the bangladesh university of engineering and technology for their study on water pollution. it touched my heart and took me back to the past.
taxi cab
when taxi cab was first introduced in dhaka city in the late 90s, people thought that the transportation problem would be solved to some extent. but due to lack of proper administration, taxi cab is now a problem to the people of dhaka city. there are many allegations against the taxi drivers. they refuse to go by the passengers' needs.
shishu park
the national shishu park, a major recreational centre not only for children but also for adults, has become a dull and dreary place. the park has remained unchanged since its inauguration in 1979. very few new things have been added to it. some of the rides might have also become rather risky, as no maintenance work is visible.
female students
it is a matter of great regret that our daughters do not find the universities a safe place. we are so unlucky. when two of our leaders, hasina and khaleda, were arrested the intellectuals continued to write so many articles in newspapers, but they have no time to write about girls and women in general.
treatment abroad
khaleda demands treatment abroad for her sons, arrested on massive corruption charges. her sons are not like the ordinary people. their mother was the prime minister for a long time. her claim shows that she should be accountable for miserably failing to develop the country's healthcare facilities, if we have to travel abroad for treatment.
role of a politician
welcome thinking on the part of the political parties to reform their constitution. hope they will evaluate the educational background of the people seeking nomination. honest, sincere and successful professionals, lawyers, scientists, intellectuals and educationists should be invited to come forward and play a role in politics.
bbc's comedy serial
i am a long time fan of comedy serial “keeping up appearances” - one of the products of british broadcasting corporation, bbc. a brief analysis of the serial would reveal, among other things, it has been designed for depicting pertinent aspects of superiority and inferiority complexes associated with human personality against the backdrop of an english social setting.
khaleda's demands
we are very much annoyed, angry and also amused by the recent demands or 'abdars' of khaleda zia. her two knee joints have been replaced in the usa and her favourite retreat ksa. her other demand of sending tarique rahman and koko abroad for treatment is far away from ground reality. the situation, circumstances and cases against khaleda zia are entirely different from that of sheikh hasina. tarique rahman with active connivance and consent of his mother inflicted the heaviest ever blow to our politics, economy, morality and society. nothing moved without paying due percentage to 'juboraj'.
half-yearly budget?
more than a week after the budget was announced through the media some members of civil society have suggested that it be made half-yearly, as the current caretaker government's tenure will end in december. why are they so late to say so? shouldn't have they floated the idea before the budget was announced?
eco-toilet & bio-fertiliser
i fully support the use of eco-toilet but i do not endorse the idea of converting human excreta collected from eco-toilets into bio-fertilizer. as far as my knowledge goes, some countries including afghanistan use such manure. but the side or adverse effects of crops and vegetables grown by the manure on human health are yet to be known. in fact, not all the technologies are good for humans and it takes a long time after the use of a technology to figure out its adverse effects on human beings. for instance, tube-well has contributed to the creation of a serious health problem, i.e. arsenicosis. recently, researchers found that arsenic is being deposited in rice plants during nutrient uptake, thereby putting this hazardous element into the food chain. again poultry litter also contains good amount of arsenic which is now widely used as fertilizer in our country.
good sign!
it is a matter of hope that we are going to be a middle income country. now the per capita income of our people is 599 dollars, which is 12.5% higher than the previous years's (2006-07 fiscal year). to be a middle income country, a country should achieve the marginal level of 750$ per capita income. the increase in gnp is good, because our country passed through some crises last year, like the devastating cyclone sidr, two consecutive floods and economic instability. most of the sectors performed poorly, yet the per capita income has gone up. here remittances from abroad played the main role.
imported paper
in the budget for the current year, the duty on imported paper has been reduced. but the paper mill owners have claimed that it will put in jeopardy an investment of around tk 3,000. in the recent years, a huge amount of tax was imposed on imported papers. and the local paper mills took advantage of the situation and increased the prices of papers. and students are the main victims.
khaleda zia and her sons
while appearing in the court on june 16, 2008 as an accused in gatco case begum khaleda zia claimed that her two sons tarique and koko are not “faltu loke” (insignificant persons) in our society. in a society where a “personal valet” is catapulted overnight into the position of a national vvip, an alleged smuggler (now convicted for corruption) is made a minister, tarique and koko are certainly not “faltu loke”. begum zia is very right to claim so. she ruled bangladesh for ten years and has been ruling over her party bnp for the last twenty six years with the same perception. what makes the people of bangladesh in general, and the admirers of shaheed president ziaur rahman in particular, sad is the way begum zia, after the assassination of her illustrious husband, groomed her two sons to their present shameful position. if even only 10% of the details of their activities as published in the media after 1/11 is true, it leaves no doubt in the minds of the ordinary people that tarique and koko did not grow up in the company of good friends and well wishers. as the sons of president zia these two young men had no business to be friends of people like…. in the absence of their father, begum zia should have been more careful in grooming up tarique and koko.
barack obama
former us vice president and presidential candidate al gore has endorsed barack obama. it is very significant as al gore is a personof great intellect, he opposed the war in iraq, is concerned about global warming and climate change, he is anxious about the future of this planet and trying his best to do something.
a suggestion
salaried people are badly bruised by an unprecedented galloping double digit inflation and skyrocketing of the prices of essential items in the last one year. considering the misery of this vast section of people, the ctg should seriously consider increasing the present tax free limit from tk.150,000/- to tk.300,000/.
water pollution
on an average a human being consumes about 2 litres of water every day. water accounts for about 70% of the weight of a human body. about 80% of the earth surface is covered by water. out of the estimated 1,011 million km3 of the total water present on earth, only 33,400 m3 of water is available for drinking, agriculture, industrial and domestic consumption. rest of the water is locked up in oceans and polar ice-caps and glaciers. considerable part of this limited quantity of water is polluted by sewage, industrial waste and a wide array of synthetic chemicals. various types of water pollutants are responsible for the pollution of water such as, organic pollutants including- oxygen demanding waste, disease causing waste, synthetic organic compounds, sewage and agricultural runoff, oil ; the inorganic pollutants including various metals and metallic compounds, suspended solids and sediments, radioactive materials etc. water pollution is indicated by various water quality parameters such as- colour, odour, do (dissolve oxygen), cod (chemical oxygen demand), bod (biochemical oxygen demand), ph, temperature range, turbidity, acidity, alkalinity etc. there are many environmental effects due to water pollution.

i was astonished to read the news report entitled “original copy of independence proclamation missing” (june 18th ds). it is indeed a shocking revelation that the original copy of the april 10, 1971 proclamation of independence, through which the first government was formed and the march 26, 1971 declaration of independence was approved, is missing! it appears from your report that after the august 15, 1975, these documents were deliberately “ lost, removed or destroyed”, by the people who were in power.
the law shall rule…
“the people said to gideon, rule over us, you and then your son and then your son's son …but he said to them 'i will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you; the lord shall rule over you”- the old testament.
teaching english
whenever the education policy is discussed, english is always given a priority. at the tertiary level english is given so much importance that in almost all the universities, there is a foundation course on english. but all talks, all seminars, conferences go in vain when i notice the faulty methods of teaching english adopted in schools. in the schools of rural areas if there is any lacking, it is because of the absence of well trained teachers. but when there is negligence in the renowned schools of urban areas, who are to blame? let us take an example of teaching english in a very renowned school in azimpur area, dhaka. teaching writing skills to the students of class eight is not an easy job. what does a teacher do in such a class? he comes and takes the syllabus asking students to know where they face problem in understanding grammar. he talks about grammatical rules insisting that such rules will not be found anywhere(it indicates his desire to draw the attention of the students to private tuition!) . he takes a chalk and duster to talk about grammar. hardly there is any session of practising what he teaches because it is a class of 45 minutes. because of this poor perception the students have to approach their parents as well as private tutors for a better understanding. many rush to coaching centres for help. usually composition is a part of english second paper. so after discussing grammar in a half hearted manner, the teacher switches over to the writing course. suddenly, he will say. “ for tomorrow's class your writing assignment will be about a rickshaw-puller and a letter to your mother on hostel life.” he will not give any guideline on how he/she should start writing. he can give the students some key words to write compositions. this needs a lesson plan and it also involves an innovative approach. view the page international

the kosovo question
kosovo's independence is a triumph of the right of self-determination and freedom. serbian military and security forces had for years suppressed the freedom movement of the people of kosovo through one of the worst genocides in history. following nato intervention and resistance by the kla, serbian military and security forces were forced to withdraw from kosovo. this was followed by the formation of a united nations interim government under un security council resolution 1244. the main objective of the un resolution was to prepare kosovo for a democratic, multi-religious, multi- ethnic and multi-cultural society, paving the way for resolving its final status. it was clear that kosovo would not revert back to the rule of belgrade after the genocide.
