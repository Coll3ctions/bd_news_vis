getting free of fears
over the past couple of days, it has been the sight of dark clouds across the skies in dar es salaam all early morning that have drawn my attention. you tend to get the feeling that the clouds will soon burst into rain. but no rain falls. the clouds somehow float away by 10. the locals have an explanation for it. according to them, because the sea is close by, these clouds form in the skies. it made me wonder if a similar phenomenon could be seen on our seashores.

“se grande problemo.”
thank you
can anyone dare question the capability of argentina superstar lionel messi? perhaps not and there was not an iota of doubt on the limitless talent of football's no 1 genius last night at the bangabandhu national stadium here in dhaka. the spectators were witness to the argentine captain's breathtaking abilities that will be remembered for a long, long time.
'eita ki chhilo!'
the day had finally arrived. cricket may be the dominant sport in the country, but nothing quite stirs passions among bangladeshi sports fans as football does -- a fact evidenced by the wild frenzy during the football world cup in which bangladesh are not even participants. and during the football world cup, it is the flag of argentina along with brazil's that colour the streets and home of the country.
history repeats itself
this interview was taken at the westin hotel few hours before the match. and chinedu obasi, coming on as a second-half substitute, scored the only goal for his side. but his strike once again was not enough for him to win a battle against messi. the argentine magician did not score but his two assists helped argentina to win the game 3-1.
