draft rti ordinance 2008

our cricket selectors
it is sad that our selectors don't know the basic things of test cricket. no one (except our selectors of test players) would disagree with the well known fact that test cricket is a game of patience, experience, form & fitness. when these basic things are remembered, no one would adventure to select our test team excluding javed omar belim golla, khaled mashud pilot, rajin saleh & aloke kapali. but our selectors went for that adventure!! this is because of their inefficiency. and they should pay for it. they should resign admitting their guilt & inefficiency. they forced many of the odi players to play test cricket. this is the main cause of our shameful failure in test cricket in the recent past. if javed omar belim golla, khaled mashud pilot, rajin saleh and aloke kapali were to play in the first test against south africa, the story could have been different.
