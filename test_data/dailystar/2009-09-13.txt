the tamils of sri lanka
the worries expressed by the united nations about the fate of two of its employees held without charge in sri lanka since last june are a reflection of what may have been going wrong in that country. since the defeat of the tamil tigers, certain moves by the government of president mahinda rajapakse have given rise to concerns in the international community about whether the administration is really building a structure of peace. the government has won the war. when it vanquished velupillai prabhakaran and his ltte, it was expected that it would move fast and decisively to build a society based on reconciliation between the majority sinhala and the minority tamils. that clearly has not happened. as many as 280,000 tamils, all of them inhabiting areas earlier controlled by the tamil tigers, have remained in camps or behind barbed wire in unhygienic, threadbare conditions. all questions of the human rights they are entitled to have been brusquely rejected by the colombo authorities.

weekly currency roundup
september 6th-september 10th, 2009
international markets
this week marked an increase in risk appetite and investor confidence in a sustained and quick recovery. the dollar hovered close to its lowest in almost a year against a basket of major currencies on thursday as firmer share and commodity prices undermined flows into the lower-yielding us currency. investors booked gains in the australian and new zealand dollars, driving them down from this week's one-year highs but the dollar still looked fragile as benchmark world stocks hit a fresh 11-month high. the dollar has suffered as investors bet on economic recovery through commodity-linked and higher-yielding currencies but some in the market said the risk rally was starting to look stretched which could see a rebound in the greenback. the dollar index, which tracks its performance against a basket of six major currencies, edged down 0.1 percent to 77.01. the index dipped to 76.803 on wednesday, its lowest level in almost a year.

illogical demand
the recent demand of bgmea seems very illogical and unethical to me. i am not a businessman, nor an expert on the economy. but the way the demands have been put forward to the govt. is ill motivated. we've noticed how the finance minister talked to this largest business community time and again to mitigate their sufferings due to economic recession all over the world. we've also come to know from the media and other different sources that the garment industry is not doing so bad as it was feared by many. once we were alarmed at the news that lots of girls would be unemployed. thank god, that has not happened yet. the present govt. is undoubtedly considerate to the demands of the garment owners. the govt. has initiated a programme of allotting rice to the garment workers. there is also a plan to form a special force for law and order in this sector. a special fund has been kept in the budget to support this sector. all these prove the good intention of this govt. but this sudden demand to allot tk 3,000 crore to pay eid bonus and salary to garment workers is illogical. i'll live comfortably in a luxurious house having a luxury car and i'll not pay monthly dues to the workers! this can not be the ethics of this largest foreign currency earning business sector. we've heard that a german buyer has stopped buying garments from bangladesh due to a report about atrocities on female workers. this is not at all acceptable. there are many painful stories related to harassment in the factories. your newspaper has carried out a lot of stories about what is happening in this sector. i remember once you printed picture of bare footed girls going to have food during break.

public money
a beautiful and thought provoking letter written by mr. sikandar ahmed has humorously delineated the reality on the ground for the useless expenditures of our police forces (dmp's high tech toy: september 2, 2009). lot of public money is mindlessly misused while we could have provided that huge money for some other important purposes. while the police force is decrying the shortage of their transports, their officers are enjoying the most luxurious and expensive jeeps. have a look at the sps of the district level who are merely a senior assistant secretary level civil servant. they all are riding latest and most expensive pajero jeeps. the digs are deputy secretary level officers. they are enjoying the 4200 cc nissan or jeeps of other makes, which are very much dissimilar to other field level officers.

asian highway
recently bangladesh has decided to join with the asian highway system. the network of asian highway, known as the great asian highway is a set-up of 141,000 km of standardized road ways crossing 32 asian countries. the ministry of communications of bangladesh has finalized three proposed routes crossing bangladesh. these are ah1, ah2 & ah41. the 495 km ah1 from india would go through benapole jessore dhaka sylhet tamabil. the 805 km ah2 from india would join hati kumrul dhaka kachpur sylhet tamabil. the 752 km ah41, also from india, will link mongla jessore hati kumrul dhaka kachpur chittagong cox's bazar teknaf with myanmar. the international sea ports, chittagong & mongla, will be connected to ah1 & ah2 by ah4, so that the ports can serve the regional needs if required. it is expected that the sophisticated highway system would ensure greater trade & social exchange between asian countries. the ah will open up huge economic opportunities through providing shorter routes for movement of goods & passengers leading to huge savings in transport costs. however, it would be native to think that the ah would bring huge turnover for our country, rather it can be ominous, if we fail to make right decisions & choose right routes in the highway system. it is like allowing transit and corridor in the name of asian highway.

the leading news media in the world bbc made the joke by this news headline "one giant slip in bangladesh news". it is because two popular newspapers of bangladesh slipped their sense of journalism by publishing news claiming the first successful human mission on moon was a drama. a website named www.theonion.com, which is a fake news website indeed, published the news that the moon mission was fake. if anyone searches the internet with the word 'onion', the result comes at the top of the page from the famous wikipedia as "the onion is an american fake news organization." but the dailies didn't check the truth behind the news and just copied it without further justification. later they apologized for this. we say our newspapers and journalism are independent and responsible, but this sort of activities not only harms the reputation of the media but also the image of the whole country. newspapers and journalists should be aware of these issues and must publish news with proper justification.

liberation war
it was interesting to watch on tv channel the parliament debate on the war of liberation. i must thank mohiuddin khan badal mp for his role in setting right the record of history and proceedings of the day. in this regard i have nothing to add except to repeat the famous saying of the former secretary of state of the usa mr casper weinberger. he said, "war is too serious a thing that can be left to the general". i think the message is clear and unambiguous. the minister for "mukti juddha " ministry might have felt embarrassed for his unclear presentation which had generated the debate. thanks to him for realizing how the war of liberation of 1971 is defined by history. the role of the army has never been underestimated and will never be undermined, but give them due credit not above the political force, the principal source for mobilization, sustenance and ultimate win in record time. the army is inclusive and not a separate entity of a nation.

pm's geneva tour
the news item in bangladesh media regarding prime minister hasina's visit to geneva has drawn my attention. she was in switzerland with a 44-member bangladesh delegation to attend a conference on climate. very nice, but why she needs to have such a huge delegation for such a conference is a question bangladesh people need to ask. and who were the members of this delegation? what are their credentials as climate experts?
restrooms for mothers
many big shopping malls have sprung up in dhaka with modern facilities like lifts, escalators, food court etc that are places of necessities and attraction particularly for women shoppers. but there are no good facilities like restrooms for lactating mothers. with increasing health consciousness and there is no substitute nutrient to mother's milk for infants, these days most of the babies from new born up to about 2 years are fed on mother's milk. in western countries big shopping malls have places for feeding mothers. view the page international

initiatives to cope with globalisation
though the global financial crisis affects the march of globalisation, economists are confident that the world will recover and globalisation will regain its momentum. globalisation holds opportunities and threats. it offers opportunities for the fittest and threatens the inefficient. it creates new products, provides newer employment opportunities and opens up new markets for the investors. it increases competition and technological development and emphasises innovative research. we must be prepared to avail the opportunities that globalisation offers us.
