the last two odis between bangladesh and sri lanka provided a lot of drama, individual heroics and nail-biting finishes, both teams having won one each, but fair to say both were very even contests. a year on, much has changed in bangladesh cricket, and in sri lanka's too. captain's armband has shifted in both sides; while bangladesh have enjoyed a very successful year, albeit against weaker opponents, sri lanka's fortunes have gone up and down, losing their last series against india badly.

government's resolve reassuring
we take heart from what the pm articulated while expressing her government's determination not to allow any further housing projects that do not meet the new criteria set up in this regard. and it is about time too. it need hardly be emphasised that dhaka city is reeling under the pressure of not only unplanned housing but also lack of other facilities and amenities that a capital should provide.
