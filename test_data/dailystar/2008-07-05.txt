apartments for all: cutting superfluous costs

impure alcohol in the land of the pure
how much do we know of literature in subcontinental languages other than our own? we know more about western literatures, down to the latest booker and pulitzer aspirants. no doubt this is another, regrettable, instance of continuing western hegemony. if things were better ordered in south asian culture, we would be familiar with at least all the major writers in the region, and there would be many more books directly translated from one regional language to another. the most satisfying translations must be those between closely related languages, such as the north indian ones, whose kinship minimizes the loss in passage. as matters stand, our best introduction to other subcontinental writers is through english - witness, for instance, a. k. ramanujan's magisterial translations from tamil and kannada. view the page star health
