crackdown on unfit river vessels
it is the same old story all over again. after thursday's launch disaster on the buriganga, the bangladesh inland water transport authority has decided to go once more into enforcing the rules that should apply to normal movement on the rivers. any enforcement of rules is certainly to be welcomed. but what becomes rather galling for people is stumbling anew on a determination of the authorities to take launch owners and operators to task only after a fresh accident on the rivers. for a few days, there is much emphasis on such river vessels not being allowed to ply without proper documents and the like, which of course is accompanied by images of launches being subjected to rigorous inspection. such seasonal activities are normal in this country. what is beyond the normal is that these activities invariably whimper into silence, until a new tragedy occurs.

"cross talk"
reading the daily star in the morning is the first task i have been doing for several years, and i never missed my favourite articles of a few columnists since my university life. when i find a topic of my interest, i read it repeatedly. 'cross talk' by mohammad badrul ahsan is such a column which i wait for every friday. it's my habit to read columns published in national and international dailies, to be aware of what is happening around me and to share how the people are responding to the current issues of the global community. in this regard the daily star has created a different taste of reading in me, especially with the trio, mohammad zamir, mohammad badrul ahsan and kazi anwarul masud.
ctg's policy
the caretaker government should look at the big picture of where this country is heading. there have been no significant economic developments; in fact, we are cursed with rising prices and various other afflictions at the moment. there is a crackdown on the extremely corrupt officials such as those of titas gas. they should be commended for that. however, generally the economy has slowed down. the salaries of government officials need to be raised to a more realistic level, given today's prices. the government would benefit from external professional management consultants who can introduce systems whereby the gas/electricity employees will not be able to breathe without someone knowing about it. they also need to encourage and support business activities and give up the scare tactics which has stunted economic growth. this will lead to more employment and prosperity for the people and more tax for the government to use for projects. if they put their hands up in defeat, apologise and accept that most of the economy is black and work with this fact, rather than fighting it, then the "small" importers can carry out business as before and hopefully bring down the food prices.
