rti under the microscope
the round table organized by the right to information forum on wednesday threw up some glaring facts about the rti one cannot be comfortable with; and that despite the information minister's claim that the government will establish a digital bangladesh through implementing the rti by the year 2021. the truth is that since the rti came into effect, not much of the tangible about its implementation or workability has been observed. what has happened has only been in fits and starts, which is again natural given that there are hardly any institutional arrangements in place for people to derive benefits from the rti. of course, one welcome factor here is the setting up of an information commission. too much emphasis on its own housekeeping and too little service to the people have characterised its work so far. however, it is beginning to provide, somewhat, the services it is meant to.

state of palestine
under threat of obama's veto, palestine's bid for statehood (1967 borders) is with the un. about time too, because all the votaries of 'democracy' will now have to either show their fangs or give credence to their oft-repeated desire for settlement of the 'palestine problem', something not created by the palestinians.
pseudo-islamists
jamaat's vaunted islamism was burning in the flame of the vehicles they torched during their violent protest rally. their only motto behind burning national properties was to grab the newspaper headlines and media focus though islam warrants us to do everything to please allah who will surely punish those pseudo islamists who is destroying the very principle in the process of establishing it. so once again it is proved that jamaat version of islam is not the true one. it is the talibani version that is behind all kinds of wanton killing of innocent people and destruction of peaceful life across the globe. so, however hard jamaat may try to convince the people that they are out to establish islam, people will not be hoodwinked by it. we bangladeshis are peace-loving and non-violent. all the saints like shahjalal, shahmakhdum and khan jahan ali propagated islam in this part of the globe by doing welfare activities, both mental and physical. some of the lakes they dug for pure drinking water, roads for easy communication and mosques and institutions for prayer and propagation of true islam are still being used, while jamaat is doing business like others with the huge amount of money they collect from the thousands of their activists. one of their hospitals ibne sina is now under scrutiny due to its alleged negligence. jamaatists must keep in mind that actions speak louder than words. our beloved prophet (pbuh) used all his property to save so many people during famine in mecca. so allah helped him establish islam in the most hostile terrain of arabia. jamaat is trying for so long but their popularity is dipping day by day, thanks to their motto: ends justify the means.

images pose hard questions
if one acknowledges that a work of art cannot be fully understood, let alone appreciated, independent of the socio-political context in which it was produced, he/she must eventually come to terms with the fact that no art can go beyond history and politics. artists and cultural activists play a decisive role in bringing about positive changes in society. hence political documentation is an important aspect of any work of art that is of some enduring value.

our politics after last tuesday
if morning shows the day, then last tuesday showed us probably an entire decade ahead of us when the unbreakable cycle of political confrontation is going to run its course again and, may be, again and again. bnp chairperson announced from a public meeting that her party isn't going to the next parliamentary election if not held under a caretaker government. if she sticks to her words and awami league is a stick in the mud, then the choices are anybody's best guess. people of this country, brace up. your lives will be that of chilies crushed between the compounding intransigencies of a mortar and a pestle.
