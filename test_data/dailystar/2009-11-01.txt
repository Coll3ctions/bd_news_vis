pakistan in an embattled condition
conditions in pakistan have clearly been going from bad to worse in this past week. just how horrific matters are in the embattled country is made obvious by the ceaseless activities of militants, especially in the northwest. the death toll from bombs and grenades detonated by elements like the taliban has been rising, with the pakistan authorities virtually unable to stem the tide of violence sweeping across large parts of it. matters are certainly not being helped by the drone attacks carried out by the americans in pakistan, especially along the border with afghanistan.

the evolving global construct
the formalisation of the g-20, in place of g-8 with the us as chairman of the board of governors, is now expected to monitor and guide politico-economic affairs of the world. yet, despite thomas friedman's claim the world is not flat enough, conflicting interests abound among g-20 and non-g-20 nations. at the recently held g-20 meeting at pittsburgh, china and other developing countries got greater say in the imf while the usa maintained its veto power, but the non-g-20 got nothing. they wanted more resources for development through a new concessional fund, a disproportionate share of the imf gold sale, a more liberal interpretation of the debt sustainability framework, and funds for climate change devastation. all they got were promises. still, the very fact that the g-20 was formalised at pittsburgh was a positive step. view the page sports

earthquake
recently we had a 6.0 magnitude earthquake that was not felt severely. earthquake researchers have predicted a massive earthquake, which may cause devastations, especially in the capital city of dhaka. according to a study conducted by bangladesh university of engineering & technology (buet) in 2003, about 60 percent structures in old dhaka are non engineered, of those 50 percent are made of flammable materials. we have the building code 1993 and building construction rules of 2006. but truly few constructions are being made under those regulations.

time distance in dhaka town is far more than the real distance. to reach a destination of 15 minutes drive with respect to distance may often require two hours or so. almost every day some reports and editorials are published in the newspapers about traffic jam. experts are also giving their views and opinions for mitigation of the traffic jam but with no results. energy and time both are lost in the traffic jam.

domestic workers: the flip side
many women liberation outfits and ngos are quite (rightly or wrongly) vocal about the rights of the domestic female workers popularly known as maid servants. these 'right outfits' incite them to serve certain interests and make the domestic workers more hostile towards the employers. however, many incidents of abuse, violence etc have been reported in the print and electronic media. we condemn the incidents and demand impartial enquiry and justice.
more cng scooters needed
the city dwellers in metropolitan dhaka, especially the middle-income group, are facing tremendous trouble while moving from one place to another. private sedan is out of their reach due to financial limitations. taxi-cab service is not easily available and also costly for them. when a family wants to join in a marriage ceremony, it needs a low cost vehicle to go to a community centre. when a patient has to be shifted to a hospital, an affordable baby taxi is needed. if a family wants to go to shopping to celebrate a festival, a baby-taxi is required. to appear in a public examination hall, a student needs transport service of a baby taxi. it is the reality in dhaka metropolis that affordable transport is not easily available. on the other hand, one cannot move to all desired places by available bus service in dhaka metropolis. it is very difficult for females to travel by bus owing to limited service and uncivilized behaviour of a section of male passengers. but it is unfortunate that in the past, governments ignored the acute need of city dwellers.

our tigers
this has reference to the news item- tigers to become extinct in 15 years- filed by inam ahmed from nepal. i doubt bangladesh tigers would die down or disappear during the coming 15 years provided the government can control poaching which is the lowest in the subcontinent, can stop killing of stray tigers by the members of the public living close to the sundarbans and if the sea level does not rise above 10 to 15cm during the coming decades.
quota for war heroes' children
it has been reported (ds october 18) that the government is taking an initiative to grant 30 per cent quota to the children of our war heroes in the ensuing selection of assistant judges. i would request the government to give a second thought to the idea. a judge must possess a very high level of iq, profound knowledge and integrity. a war hero's son or daughter may not necessarily have those qualities of head and heart and may not qualify in the selection tests. there is nothing wrong in that. everybody is not cut for everything. if one does not qualify in the tests for the selection of judges one may try to do something else where s/he might excel. if a wrong candidate who does not have the required intellectual ability, knowledge and integrity is appointed as a judge s/he will be failing to apply her/his judicial mind correctly. people who will be going to such a judge will be deprived of justice. people will suffer in the hands of such an incompetent judge for about 30 years or so till s/he retires. merit and competence should be the only criteria while selecting candidates for posts like those of judges, and nothing else. it is said that judges dispense justice on his behalf. people who will deliberately select wrong kind of people as judges will surely be held responsible by god on the great day of judgment. that is what we all believers believe in.
new school timing
my daughter's school begins at 8:00am. so, she has to start from home at 7:00am. during the time of her preparation at home, it is almost dark and thus 2-3 bulbs have to be lighted. before introducing the new timing we did not need to switch on any light. like us, thousands of people switch on their bulbs before sending their wards to school. i do not understand why schools have been brought under this new timing as schools break up some hours ahead of sunset. view the page international

making the invisible visible
by the time this piece has been published and circulated, the dust, leftovers, decorations and fanfare of extreme poverty eradication day will have been swept up and discarded. the grand announcements will have been made, oaths pledged, ideas shared and applause long faded. what comes after the microphones are stowed away and flashbulbs have been tamed is what really matters and what the event's theme making the invisible visible is all about. the argument for observing such a day seems rather baffling when one imagines every think tank, intergovernmental organisation and even the bangladeshi government is resigned to the fact that chronic and extreme poverty are inevitable, beyond our control or even a god-given curse. then why, one might ask, spend large sums of money organising a conference in lavish surroundings with international and national dignitaries when such resources can be diverted to help the very people the conference hopes to address? it's rather simple: the extreme poor are seldom recognised by the political elite: government policies seldom, if ever, reach the economic bottom 10 percent of the population, and state safety net programmes fail to mitigate their poverty and often confuse them with the moderate poor. there are a number of other reasons but essentially, high-profile events like this year's extreme poverty eradication day provide a platform to reach the highest levels of government and advocate for change.
an extreme poverty manifesto
in 1996 i was carrying out research for my phd on ngos and poverty reduction in rural bangladesh. one evening, after a long day trekking round aimlessly trying to find people to interview, i was sitting on the office veranda of a local ngo that had kindly offered me hospitality. it was a beautiful evening with one of those bangladeshi sunsets that leave you breathless, even inspired. as usual, a number of people had gathered at the front of the ngo office hoping to be able to speak to the ngo leader or his senior staff. from among the crowd, an elderly woman slowly made her way towards me and asked if i could help her by talking to the ngo leader on her behalf. this was not an unusual request and i had become quite used to telling people that i neither worked for the ngo nor had the gravitas to influence its leaders. this time however the elderly woman ignored my response as she persisted in trying to get my attention. those next to me on the veranda tried to gently move her away by asking her to join the queue of people at the front of the ngo office where 'she might be attended to'. again unconvinced, she stubbornly held her ground. there was something admirable about her persistence and i began to chat with her.
baader-meinhof to bin laden
on november 5, 1605, guy fawkes was caught with thirty-six barrels of gunpowder, attempting to blow up the house of lords in the palace of westminster, during the state opening of parliament. the plot was to assassinate the king of england along with almost the entire british aristocracy. since then, in adherence to tradition and the true spirit of british democracy, parliament has never been opened on the november 5 (except once), and the houses of parliament are ceremoniously searched by the yeomen of the guard, as a precaution against traitors and religious zealots. parliament was subsequently opened on november 9, when his majesty did not miss the opportunity to wax eloquent on "the divine right of monarchs" to rule, and the infernal "catholic question".
