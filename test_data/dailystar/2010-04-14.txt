drinking water
it is the duty of a democratic govt to fulfil the basic needs of citizens, whereas the condition of drinking water in dhaka city is beyond description. the city dwellers are suffering much as bad odour and detrimental suspended solids are found in the water, even after boiling it is not possible to drink it, as it is aesthetically not pleasing to the people. moreover, there is a great possibility of becoming ill at any time having this water. meanwhile, the high court has directed the govt to take necessary steps to alleviate the sufferings of city dwellers. it proves that the respective authorities are not concerned in this regard as the city corporation is not also carrying out their responsibilities under proper rules and order. every day we find news in the electronic and print media that the ''pure drinking water'' crisis has become the most talked about issue in dhaka city but the authorities concerned still have not taken any initiative in this regard.

new species of butterfly
researchers of jahangirnagar university have spotted new species of butterflies. the five-member team comprises a teacher (associate professor monowar hossain) and students of zoology department. universities are the places for research. our teachers are not only responsible for teaching at universities but also for researching. but very few research activities take place in our public universities apparently. teachers are busy all day taking classes not only in their universities but also in private universities. students also do not want to spend time in extra curricular activities. i think the spotting of new butterfly species at ju is a good example of what good research can bring.
court sanctity trampled
this kind of headline in the country's major english daily like ds which is widely read by interested readers including foreigners reflects the environment prevailing in the bangladesh courts and the quality of lawyers. the lawyers supporters of a political party are out to save their corrupt leaders resorting to violence in the courtroom instead of going through the judicial process. the question now arises how did they know beforehand that their leader will not get fair justice in the court? through their unjust violence, the people got to know that the leader is guilty and she is trying to evade judicial process and opted for wrong path of igniting unrest among her blind supporters to save her.
a suggestion
i would like to give my heart felt thanks to the editor and the organisers of the award presentation ceremony for the outstanding students of o and a levels. my son was one of them getting 10 'a's in his o level. it was indeed a splendid ceremony to attend. but one thing that i felt disappointed about was when the magazine came out naming all the award winners. when you name the award winners in the magazine you do not mention how many 'a's he/she achieved along with his/her ambition and favourite quotation. this is one improvement the daily star should definitely work upon; from the next time please do mention the number of grades each student achieved instead of naming only the highest achievers.

nationwide celebrations on pahela baishakh
as a regular annual programme to usher in the new bengali year, chhayanaut is holding barshoboron 1417 today at the historical ramna batomul, in the city. channel i will telecast the day's programme live from the spot, while telnet, grameenphone's sister concern, will disseminate the detailed programme on the website "www.chhayanaut.org" so that anyone can log into it. grameenphone is patronising the programme.
festival on canvas
folk art is quite popular in the sub-continent. the genre is closely connected to our culture and heritage. some painters like to portray various religious, cultural and folk festivals in bangladesh. many artists start their journey with folk art and it generally encapsulates the identity, custom and language of a particular place or community. needless to say, folk elements are in abundance in the works of painters like zainul abedin, quamrul hassan, sm sultan, rashid chowdhury, samarjit roy chowdhury, abdus shakoor shah and others.
the beat of baishakh
chhayanaut's annual barshobaran and other cultural organisations' special programmes for pahela baishakh are on, much to the delight of music aficionados.
dancing in the new year
shibli mohammed, shamim ara nipa and the team of nrityanchal have been pretty active in the year that has just ended. shibli mohammed was vocal about their various works last year and their fixtures in this bengali year:
mela: unadulterated fun
nothing denotes festivities in bangladesh like mela (fairs). originating from rural bengal, these modest expositions have gone through some makeover and now get much fanfare in the urban areas. unsurprisingly, mela is a big part of pahela baishakh celebrations. be it the informal neighbourhood congregation, the major event where the crème of dhaka hobnob, or the vibrant, delightfully gaudy rural affair -- mela gives us an opportunity to let go of our mundane worries for a while and soak up all the fun elements of it -- live music, jatra, putul naach (puppet dance), nagordola (a smaller indigenous version of ferris wheel), snacks, sweets, clothes, churi (glass bangles), toys and much more.
a musical message on new year
"hindu na musalman, bouddho na christian, shob bhuley jao eshey gechhey pahela baishakh": the song calls everyone to come together -- irrespective of religion -- to celebrate pahela baishakh, the biggest secular bengali festival.

our baishakh dreams and prayers
let there be a celebration of the bengali spirit today. it is a spirit that has done us well through the centuries. baishakh is a good deal more than a simple beginning of a new year. it is, indeed, a paean to heritage, a highlighting of the cultural traditions we are heir to. baishakh is a harkening back to the past in as much as it is a comprehension of the present and a prediction of the future.
a gala day for bengalees
everything under the sun looks gay and cheerful and colourful. as we celebrate pahela baishakh we remember that the babylonians were in fact the first observers of new year about 4,000 years ago. celebration of the new year is the oldest of all holidays.
