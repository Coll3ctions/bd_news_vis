last week while i was waiting with some of my friends for the train at the airport railway station, we lost our laptop and a purse with a good amount of money in it. we were at a loss what to do. after we got on the train, a group of boys came to us with our missing bag. they told us that they noticed the bag while they were walking along the railway. they guessed that the bag was ours as they saw us leaving the place. we felt so happy and wanted to give them some money as a reward. but ganesh, shuzan, mona and other boys requested us to impart them education, instead of giving them some money. they will thus learn how to read and write. they also said that they would be able to earn money once they become literate. the integrity of the boys amazed us.

splitting of dhaka city
as a capital city, dhaka has a long history. among the 64 districts in the country, hardly a few cities have undergone what is known as urban development. people from all over the country come to dhaka in search of a livelihood. to keep the city habitable, multi-sectoral coordinated move by the government in consultation with the local representatives and members of the civil society is needed.
changing realtors' mindset
i think the reason developers flout building construction codes is that they do not know why should they obey the rules. maybe they don't know why filling up of water bodies should harm the environment, for will they not, 9n the short term, earn millions of taka from those works? who cares, what those will cost the nation in the longer term? maybe they don't know why they should make adequate parking facilities so that traffic congestion might ease for the convenience of many. maybe they don't know why they should stop building so many buildings at the same time? the infrastructure of dhaka city? but then why is the is the government so fussy about such minor problems?
deadly tipaimukh dam
indian prime minister manmohan singh has reiterated its earlier assurance that bangladesh would not be harmed by the 1,500 mw tipaimukh hydroelectric project. india had said the same thing during the construction of farakka dam. now see how severely agricultural lands of bangladesh are affected due to the farkka dam. so many rivers are dead due to this dam. bangladesh could have produced much more crops if there were no such dam. in fact, this dam turned a part of bangladesh inro desert. according to the environmentalists, tipaimukh and other dams planned by the indian government will result in the death of therest of our rivers. dams constructed by india are one of the main reasons of poverty in bangladesh. we are grateful to india for helping us during our war of independence. but today they are doing things which go against our welfare. this dam will not benefit the indian people much. and not only bnp but also indian environmentalists are against the building of this dam. previously, india followed the ideology "people above profit," but now it follows the ideology of "profit above people".
stand beside palestinian brethren
through this letter i condemn the continuous attacks made by israel against the people of palestine. the air strikes by israel on december 8th took three innocent lives in gaza and injured many. the strikes also destroyed many houses. this is simply violation of human rights. but sadly enough, we are not doing anything to help them. our prophet(pbuh) said that the entire muslim community is like one body. if one part of the body is hurt then it hampers the functioning of the whole body. similarly, if a muslim is hurt in any part of the world, it hurts the entire community.

nine by three patriotism
our patriotism works like the recoil of a rifle. in 1971 we had fired the shots of freedom for nine months, and ever since then have been living in its back thrust three months of a year. the number of months we didn't fight in that fateful year matches exactly with the number of months we are overwhelmed by patriotic zeal. the number of months we actually fought is exactly the number of months when that exuberance goes to sleep.
gently blow the winds of change
in 1971 a nation was born out of a fierce and bloody battle for independence and even as i was a witness to that painful birth, i was myself "reborn" out of it. that deep well of sorrow also held my cup of joy. it was in enslavement that i dreamt of liberty and it was in repression that i sang my most beautiful songs of freedom.
