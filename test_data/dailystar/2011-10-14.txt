freedom for palestinian prisoners
the willingness of the israeli government to free more than a thousand palestinian prisoners in return for the release of an israeli soldier now in the hands of hamas is reason for surprise. that is because of the intransigence the government of binyamin netanyahu has consistently demonstrated where dealing with the palestinians is concerned. even so, his readiness to free the prisoners in order to have soldier gilad shalit released by palestinian extremist groups could be regarded as a sign of the israeli authorities softening their belligerence somewhat. perhaps that could lead to some new thinking about the palestine issue as a whole. view the page sports
splendid simmons keeps tigers at bay
expectations got the better of the tigers yesterday in the first one-dayer against the west indies at the sher-e-bangla national stadium. a defeat of 40 runs was a justifiable result as bangladesh was erratic with the ball, slack in the field while ultimately the batsmen too flattered to deceive.

reaching govt's service to the poor
the government has selected jessore as the first digital district as part of the first step towards making all districts digital under access to information programme. good governance and its associated services simply do not reach many people, and where they do, the services offered are so corrupted, inefficient and disorganised that they fail to make any positive impact. there exists a vicious loop: the impact of poor governance is felt disproportionately by those who are poor, unorganised and do not have the means to access services from alternative channels, such as the private sector and the middlemen. in turn, this further diminishes the opportunities available to them to break the cycle of poverty, exploitation and marginalisation. governance services such as maintaining the rule of law, primary education, primary health care, preserving equality and human rights, targeted government programmes and subsidies, can enhance welfare of people in any country. yet large sections of people, especially in developing countries, remain poor, exploited and marginalised, and are not able to improve their lives as they are deprived of even the most fundamental benefits of good governance.

why give people false hope?
the economists predicted and suggested how to prevent the downward journey of the county's economy! it seems like it is becoming a national pastime: people coming on talk shows talking about how to improve the country's lot; people sitting at round-tables and talking about how to improve our economy. of course, none of this will ever be implemented. i am just wondering if the people involved know this. and i couldn't believe that it would become the headline.

blaming the drivers only!
most of the time when road accidents take place, we only blame the drivers. it is not right to blame them alone. the brta authorities and the commuters are also responsible for this. thousands of drivers, who hardly have any knowledge about driving and traffic rules, get licenses by bribing the officials of brta. and it has become a common practice that the commuters shout at the drivers to overtake other vehicles. it is our responsibility to curb road accidents.

the populist movement
