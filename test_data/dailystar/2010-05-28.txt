wasa affairs
wasa water supply during march' 2010 around rashed khan menon sarak area was very critical as the deep tube-well pump in this locality remained idle due to electricity failure, while the emergency diesel generator was not in operation. the wasa generator was dead due to diesel shortage or mechanical breakdown as informed by pump officials of wasa. the lgrd minister declared deployment of armed forces form the first week of april 2010 and miraculously the diesel generator went into operation and our water crisis was solved instantaneously. thus presence of armed forces is essential for our daily day-to-day life, i believe.
saving electricity
our country is now facing a serious crisis of "electricity shortage". various measures are being taken to save electricity. however, if we take the following measures we can save a considerable amount of power:

bnp's policy
the bnp (the opposition party with previous record of governing twice), with only about one tenth of the js seats, is making loud noises on bringing down the present regime. the party's jargon is familiar, without any new points. the criticism is entirely negative (as always). a minority of the voters also try to analyse the national problems and they find no solace in bnp's line of criticism.
volatile share market
to the utter dismay of small investors, the security and exchange commission's frequent interference in the name of protecting interest of small investors has made the share market volatile. the imposition of many restrictions such as restrictions on right shares, use of cash payment on certain shares etc. has damaged the normal flow of the share market. when the grameenphone entered the share market, new investors in large numbers, even at upazila level, came forward to open bo account and invested in the gp with the hope to get a return on their investment.

thierry henry
current fc barcelona player and once a living legend of arsenal is thinking about his future in the major league soccer (mls) in the usa after the 2010 world cup. he was a god to arsenal fans where he started to make his fortune. it was at arsenal that henry made his name as a world-class footballer. despite initially struggling in the premier league, he emerged as arsenal's top goal-scorer for almost every season of his tenure there. under long-time mentor and coach arsène wenger, henry became a prolific striker and arsenal's all-time leading scorer with 226 goals in all competitions. the frenchman won two league titles and three fa cups with the gunners; he was twice nominated for the fifa world player of the year, was named the pfa players' player of the year twice, and the football writers' association footballer of the year three times. henry spent his final two seasons with arsenal as club captain, leading them to the uefa champions league final in 2006. in june 2007, after eight years with arsenal, he transferred to barcelona for a fee of €24 million. in barcelona he did manage to win trophies but his striking skills began to lose its sharpness and in 2010 he spent most of his time sitting in the reserved players bench. it is speculated that now he is planning to join one of the lower rated leagues of the world (mls) where he will probably spend rest of his career and leave football. had he not opted for money, he would have been still one of the greatest players of barclays premier league, but alas! his endless urge for money and fame is finally pulling the curtain down on his successful career. arsenal will never forget henry, though.
wal-mart
the other day, i saw in your daily that wal-mart has opened a store in india and a few more are on the pipeline. bangladesh is just next door to india. it has 150 million people or so. though most of them live below poverty line, yet i believe wal-mart would be overwhelmed to see the sale proceeds. besides wal-mart would be able to cater to the needs of the overseas americans stationed in bangladesh.

sanity in student politics
student politics is not bad as such if the aim of the politics is to learn how to develop the country and how to do good for the people. but it seems it is getting convoluted nowadays. students should concentrate on the study first because the knowledge they gather can be utilised when they will be at the helm of the country. but, unfortunately, the present student political activists, except a few microscopic exceptions, are now engaged in possessing illegal lethal arms, extortion, tender snatching, sometimes kidnapping and killing, as if they have been there to learn how they will continue those bad practices in their greater lives.
barking dogs…
in the early years of our lives, we learnt in school that barking dogs do not bite. probably it was an adage. i was confused about its appropriateness, though. the confusion is still ingrained in my mind.
hartal call
the main opposition party namely the bnp is resorting to destructive political programmes like hartal, but we know that politicians engage in politics for the welfare of general people. but we do not know how hartal can help the general people. so, we hope the bnp will withdraw its hartal call.
flags
