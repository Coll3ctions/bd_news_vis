all eyes on copenhagen
the atmospheric build-up to world climate conference in copenhagen on which the curtain is being raised today has been climactically propitious. it is marked by a forward-looking change at the upper echelons of the world order which also happen to be the biggest emitters of green house gases. as such they bear the responsibility of leading the way in cutting ghg emissions, a task to which they seem to be warming up with a degree of flexibility missing so far.
under-aged drivers
it is extremely disquieting to learn that on an average 28 accidents take place in the city every day. and what is of particular worry is that under-aged drivers of public transport are responsible for most of the accidents. the dhaka metropolitan police is reported to have launched a special drive against these under-aged drivers and arrested 14 of them on saturday.
the ever-evolving cycle of crises
when the berlin wall came crashing down 20 years ago the cold war ended, and the mood was celebratory in the west. instead of two superpowers there was one, and the only ideology that survived was capitalism -- a brash form of capitalism at that. the elder george bush arrogantly proclaimed that the world had better learn how to do things the american way, because it was they who knew what worked. he said: "free markets work." the reach of the market grew longer over the next two decades, encompassing china, india, and former soviet union along with its satellites.
prologue to india visit
prime minister sheikh hasina is scheduled to visit india shortly. the visit is expected to be fruitful mainly because of a changed mind-set of politicians and bureaucrats in bangladesh, and hopefully in india, in approaching the festering issues in an objective manner. indo-bangladesh relations have been bedeviled by a host of issues that both countries have been viewing from the narrow plane of self-interest instead of the changed global situation where integrated approach to presumed insoluble issues have proved to be more successful than disjointed approach aimed more at domestic audience than at the long term interest of the country and the people.
not a future threat but a current reality

lanka run riot

pakistan level series
if pakistan are not to go another three years and 12 tests without a win, much will rest, as it has always, on their bowling. the very shape and variety of this attack, the threat of wickets alive in each of them, did for new zealand at the basin reserve in wellington, taking pakistan to an ultimately comfortable 141-run win to level the series, going into napier. mohammad asif and danish kaneria were the heavies this innings, but at all times mohammad aamer and a luckless umar gul were chomping at the bit behind them.

kuakata tourist centre
the world is blessed with many wonderful places attracting people to see the exquisite beauty of the nature. one such place is kuakata situated at the end point of patuakhali district. it is a rare gift that nature has offered us.
bangladesh and democracy
bangladesh turned over a new leaf in the world's history with the achievement of independence through a nine month-long bloody war. it is a third world country burdened with a population abnormally higher in comparison with its small area. it is the most densely-populated country of the world whose majority of people are poor and illiterate and consequently live in extreme poverty. they cannot afford to meet their basic needs. they never bother about what democracy means and whom it serves. it is a matter out of their thinking purview. what indispensably matters to them is the interminable certainty of square meals three times a day and, if possible, the satisfactory fulfilment of their fundamental demands guaranteed by the constitution of the country.
hatirjheel project
looking at the progress of this project, it seems that it is moving at a very slow pace. the much expected tk 1,600 crore development project of hatirjheel project is unlikely to be complete in time.
gas and diesel prices
it is interesting to note that the govt. again and again publicises that food price is under control. but what about gas? there is anomaly between diesel and gas price. though i am not an expert, but after a few months of my writing to the communications minister about gas-diesel price anomaly, now it is also endorsed by the cng association. they say gas price is higher than diesel. as a result, owners of transport are less interested in converting their engines to gas. the govt. in the past encouraged conversion to cng. but the situation is changing. as a result valuable foreign exchange will be invested in importing fuel. the government should give serious thought to use of gas in the transport sector. in the mean time lpg gas price has been reduced. i congratulate the govt. for this right step. it has been reported that the govt. is contemplating further lowering of the prices of diesel. such one-sided reduction of diesel price will not be productive. the govt. must rethink about gas price in the interest of saving foreign exchange.
spirit of sacrifice
there are some people who think that to buy high priced animals for 'qurbani' is a matter of prestige but we must remember that it is of no value to him as there is the indication in the verses in the holy quran-"it is not their meat, nor their blood, that reaches allah, it is their piety that reaches allah.”
media policy on armed forces
prime minister sheikh hasina's disclosure that the government was formulating a media policy for defence forces is something we should watch out (the daily star, november 23). democratic tenets afford us the right to information on any public institution, be that the supreme court or the armed forces, and efforts designed to shield such institutions from fair scrutiny through laws would be undemocratic and counterproductive. as with any civilized nation, there would be occasional questions about professional competence of the forces, but that does not mean that the non-uniformed are less patriotic and have 'vested interest.' the economist in its november 5 issue observed that “bangladesh's defence preparedness is woeful vis-a- vis its myanmar counterpart, and it's only natural for us to ask why such is the case. you only duck behind laws if you have no answer; impact on 'morale' is a poor argument.
bangladesh and its neighbours
myanmar is strategically situated to take the advantages of competition and cooperation between china and india over oil and gas resources. both china and india are seeking to control the indian ocean for strategic military and economic reasons. the united states has been trying to militarise the region on the ground of fighting possible terrorist attacks and has already established an airbase on banda ache, indonesia. apprehending that the us is hell-bent on a unilateral militarisation of the entire region from the middle east oil fields to the strait of malacca, beijing has stepped up its engagement in myanmar. the strait of malacca, linking the indian and pacific oceans, is the shortest sea route between the persian gulf and china. myanmar also presents a possible supply route for oil and other commodities for china. an oil pipeline linking myanmar's deep-water port of kyaukpyu with kunming in china's yunnan province was approved by beijing in 2006. china is also myanmar's most important defence ally, providing most of its military hardware and training.
construction noise!
i live in shekhertek, mohammadpur area, in the capital. no doubt it is a burgeoning locality with multi-storeyed buildings, markets and office blocks. every day there goes up a new building. but all the construction materials are piled up and dumped by roadside, obstructing the normal thoroughfare. the roads are narrow and road condition is so bad that even the rickshaws ply in slow motion. heavy trucks are parked here and there even in day time.
party affiliation
some leaders of at least two political parties were elected members of parliament (mp) using awami league (al) symbol i.e. boat. reportedly, these parties are registered with the election commission (ec) and were allotted respective party symbols e.g. hammer, torch etc. certain questions obviously come to one's mind.
bureaucracy & politics
why dhaka city's streets are so overcrowded, and parliament looks so empty? it is the political magic in bangladesh; practised for so many decades since 1972.
american policy
america is realizing four times what she is giving ldcs in aid. bangladesh pays more that 15 per cent tariff while saudi arabia pays less than one percent. it reminds us of a proverb, “to carry coal to newcastle.” america went to unjust wars that killed so many people and destroyed the economies of the poorer countries. we can now clearly see through her tokenism. the sooner america realizes that exploiting the poor does not pay, the better.
autographs
i have been an autograph hunter since i was 12, more than five decades years ago, which is one of my hobbies.
price hike
a few months ago we saw that price hike was somewhat moderate but nowadays the price hike is so acute and unbearable for all classes of people.
mistakes in textbook
social studies and bangladesh, book-5 (second edition-nov 2008) contains a lot of language errors which are very misleading for the children. the book contains a preface where the publisher did not acknowledge the errors to correct in future editions of the same. this book is mainly prescribed for the children of english medium schools in bangladesh. consequently, most of the children learn wrong english. for example in page 54, chapter 8, there is a wrong sentence written like -- "the children of different groups of sri lanka varies from one another ...." but the correct sentence should be -- "the children of different groups of sri lanka vary from one another...." there are more serious spelling mistakes in the same page. similarly, there are more grave language and printing mistakes throughout the book.
what a country!
a news report in the daily samakal of november 1 made me write a few words under the above caption. the report from kurigram says that a man, who is alleged to have left no deceitful or fraudulent ways on earth untried to make fortunes and acquire position, contested in one of the parliament elections and has now become vice-chairman of the upazila!
whither uno?
following the collapse of the league of nations, the usa and the european countries established the united nations organisation (uno).
us aid
as reported, in 2008 the aid received by us from the usa amounted to us$151 million; while during the same period, bangladesh exporters paid us$573 million as export tariff! poor (nephew) bangladesh paid rich (uncle sam)usa, us$422 million in excess of the total aid received! it confirms the saying that: "the rich are getting richer, and the poor are becoming poorer"!
load-shedding
nowadays load-shedding has become a household word. at present it is a common feature of life in bangladesh. the government of bangladesh has pushed back the clock time for decreasing load-shedding. but there is no result. in the evening electricity is very essential but it is not available.
high-tech crimes
profits of high-tech crimes are high; hackers are able to steal without any geographical limitations. categories of computer crimes: 1) computers can be used as storage or communication devices whereby information can be created, stored, manipulated, and communicated electronically. 2) the computer can be used as an instrument or a tool of crime and can be used as a weapon to commit attack on the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. high-tech crimes pose a problem to law enforcement agencies for two reasons: a) these crimes are not easily detected since the offenders can quietly commit them from any computer terminal, usually in the comfort of their own homes. b) most of the law enforcement agencies are not equipped to deal with the matter.
good move
the other day while i was going to gulshan, a cng (three-wheeler) caught my attention. usually we see the cng drivers lock themselves inside an iron framed door but to my surprise, in this cng the passengers were also locked in with an iron framed door. it gave me immense joy thinking that the cng owners have started taking measures to protect their passengers. and this is a much more effective way to save passengers' priceless lives and wealth from snatchers than all the measures taken by the govt and law enforcers so far. view the page international
