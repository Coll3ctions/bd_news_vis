putting the bdr mutineers on trial
the government's decision on the modalities of the trial of those involved in the bdr mutiny last february finally sets the ball rolling. that is not to say that it has had an easy time of it. what with all the loopholes in the laws pertaining to discipline in the bangladesh rifles and the difficulties involved in invoking the army act in trying the mutineers, the government certainly had to operate within a number of ambiguities and constraints. at one point, it turned to the supreme court for its opinion, which in its turn sought the advice of eminent jurists before coming to the conclusion that the bdr mutiny could not be prosecuted under the army act.

industrial pollution
although bangladesh is primarily considered an agrarian economy, industry now makes a significant contribution to gdp of the country. there are industrial zones pivoting around principal urban centres of bangladesh. besides, various small and medium scale industries are scattered all over the country. a recent survey conducted by the doe (department of environment) notes that more than 1200 industries discharge about 35,000 cubic meter wastes that lead to environmental degradation. in my view to save the environment from industrial pollution, the government should ensure the following pollution control strategies
tipaimukh dam and other issues
while welcoming the bilateral agreement between the indian foreign minster and our foreign minister at new delhi recently, i feel that what we got on tipaimukh is “an assurance” and not an agreement to the effect that india would not do anything “which would adversely impact bangladesh” as reported in the daily star of 11 september '09 .
diverse bangladeshi culture
bangladesh has a culture that encompasses elements both old and new. the bengali language boasts a rich literary heritage, which bangladesh shares with the indian state of west bengal. the earliest literary text in bangla is the eighth century charyapada. bangla literature in the medieval age was often either religious (e.g. chandidas), or adaptations from other languages (e.g. alaol). bangla literature matured in the nineteenth century. its greatest icons were the poets rabindranath tagore and kazi nazrul islam. bangladesh also has a long tradition in folk literature, evidenced by maimensingha gitika, thakurmar jhuli or stories related to gopal bhar.
jamaat leader's son
recently, dr. alauddin ahmed, prime minister's advisor, issued a statement that brig. azmi, son of jamaat leader golam azam, was sacked from the army on national security ground. this statement appears outrageous that after so many years of distinguished service and career, a person has to leave his service in this manner. golam azam should have faced war criminal charges long time ago. however, golam azam's misdeeds should not be the reason to inflict any unjust act on his son. some people responsible for such inconsiderate and morally wrong acts should think again that they will not be in power forever. my request to these people is, please do the right thing. do not victimise people for actions of their parents.
save small fish
fishes which grow to size of 25cm or 9 inches in mature or adult stage in their life cycle are known as small indigenous species (sis). about 144 small indigenous species are available in our country. but today most of the species are going to be extinct in our natural habitats. due to indiscriminate exploitation of brood and baby fishes, reduced natural habitats, presence of irrigation projects, huge amount of silting, use of pesticides and pollution from industrial wastes, the fish population is dwindling.
vgf card
"vgf bid at stake”, the news was published in the daily star on 6 september which drew my attention.
digital bangladesh
the government declared that bangladesh would become a digital country by 2021. if i clarify its meaning, it refers to the initiation of e-governance, e-commerce, e-business and e-fit system around the country. the important thing to implement “digital bangladesh” is the electricity. unfortunately, electricity is not produced as per its demand. electricity supplied from the national grid is very meagre in amount and load-shedding is a regular phenomenon. but our government is not showing any concern over this issue.
quacks at work
quacks who dishonestly claim to have special knowledge and skill in medicine are found in the busy streets, railway stations and terminals, selling their medicine. they are, indeed, very popular among the illiterate people. by songs, convincing lectures or by any other tricks, they create a crowd of listeners in order to sell their so-called medicine. they say that they can cure all serious diseases which modern medical science cannot! now they are distributing their leaflets to people, using microphones, and what not. the simple-minded people are often cheated by them. in the circumstances, the authorities concerned should take stern steps against all these quakes.
asian highway
it is good news that the government of bangladesh has decided to join the asian highway. but the parliamentary committee's recommendations for accepting proposed routes ah1 (benapole-jessore-bhanga-dhaka-kanchpur-sylhet-tamabil) or ah2 (banglabanda-hatikumrul-tangail-dhaka-kanchpur-sylhet-tamabil) do not seem to reflect due considerations being given to our national interest. though unescap proposed these two routes as international, a closer look will reveal the regional nature of both these routes. the fact that both the routes start from and end in india after passing through bangladesh is an added disadvantage for us.
unfair deals
the al govt is striking unfair and unequal deals on petroleum and gas with foreign companies without much debate in js regarding its pros and cons, also there is no debate in the media. if the govt is right, what are they afraid of? why anu muhammad or other economists couldn't be seen in btv and other channels with open debates before any contract with those us companies was signed ? what do they want to hide? this hiding tendency is not compatible with a democratic govt at all. as remitters we are concerned. we need to be convinced before sending further remittance to bangladesh.
corrupt railwaymen
last july i went to dinajpur for official work. on the way to dinajpur by ekota inter city train what i saw was beyond expectation. when the train reached parbotipur station, a good number of passengers got into it. eventually, i was over there(that compartment). they did not take ticket from the counter. some time after the train left the station, the travelling ticket examiner (tte) came to the compartment and collected money from the passengers who had boarded the train from parbotipur station without ticket. i stared at his radiant face for a while. when he understood that i kept my eyes on him, he left the compartment without delay. probably this is the normal practice.
hartal
it is very disappointing that people did not respond to the call of hartal by the national committee to protect gas, oil, mineral resources and power in dhaka city on september 14, 2009.
sufferings of students
this year, the honourable education board members decided to make some changes in our education system. as a result, now all the students of class six to nine are taking lessons in the creative system. this system is supported by most people. but this is not all. the main thing is that this system is totally new to the students. as i am a student of class eight, i have seen the sufferings of students closely. everybody thought that it would bring good to us. but the reality is that the system is not proper for us.
who is a leader?
it is not the one who leads in politics, nor on the battlefield, nor in say business activities. a leader is undoubtedly the one who gives moral leadership to the nation by his/her thoughts and actions.
