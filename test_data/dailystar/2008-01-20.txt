the 10th day of muharram is a day of mourning for the muslims of the world. it is also a day of triumph.
fighting terrorism
we in bangladesh have observed two strands of reaction to the question of terrorism. there are those who have always cried wolf at any mention of terrorism, to a point where they have ended up exaggerating or over-estimating the influence of religious extremism in the country. that has often created a rather sickening doomsday scenario. and then there is the other, equally lamentable truth, which is that influential quarters in the government have always been in denial mode on the terrorism question. one has only to go back to the jmb issue to know how resolutely the government of the day denied its presence, with consequences that were to be horrific. the point here is that we as a nation cannot afford to fall into the pitfalls created by either of the two assumptions above. in other words, we cannot afford to panic and at the same time must not be tempted into adopting a laid-back position.

significance of george bush's middle east tour
bush ended his eight day middle east trip a few days ago, sparking questions concerning various issues, particularly the israeli-palestinian conflict and iran's nuclear capability. but the most significant part of his tour has been the resumed peace process between israel and palestine, which had remained dormant for more than seven years as it received very scant importance from the bush administration. george bush's visit to ramallah gave the green signal for the middle east peace process, as he called for an end to israel's 41-year occupation of palestinian lands and stated a commitment to forge a peace agreement before the end of his tenure in office. bush said: "i believe its going to happen, that there's going to be a signed peace treaty by the time i leave office." he further emphasised that the palestinian refugees would be paid compensation for the loss of homes when they fled after occupation by israel. view the page sports
