giving the police the wherewithal
the government's decision to make an allocation of tk. 18 crore in the 2007-08 fiscal year as funds for the police to bear the cost of investigations certainly goes some way toward meeting their requirement. alongside this, the provision of 30 per cent of their basic salary as allowances for traffic policemen clearly argues the case for greater efficiency on their part. all of this goes towards fulfillment of a long-felt need on the part of the police department.

clark's quiet climb

twenty20 cricket
i just love the way the atmosphere builds up during the match. i am fascinated as the commentators tell us everything about the teams, and the camera pans round the packed grandstands and we feel the crowd's excitement and …… but then, reality strikes with a nauseating thud. the tv station cuts to yet another advertisement.

ramadan price hike
we were gearing up for the holy month of ramadan last week amid massive price hike. the start of ramadan, the ninth and the holiest month of the islamic calendar, is traditionally determined by the sighting of new moon. for the month, we are required to abstain from food, drink etc from dawn until dusk, as life slips into a lower gear during the day, and it peaks between iftar, the breaking of the fast at sunset, and sehri, the last meal of the day before sunrise.
global warming
for god's sake, please wake up. things are going from bad to worse every day. for quite some time i have been trying to convince the world that we are just trying for a remedy on a wrong diagnosis.

us-led naval exercise
we can recall our history when the us navy's seventh fleet came to the bay of bengal in 1971 to defeat the liberation war of bangladesh. it was the time when this fleet tried to intimidate india as it fought pakistan along with bangladeshi freedom fighters in a war that led to bangladesh's birth. it was the period when the indian foreign policy upheld the principles of non aligned movement and followed the path towards self-reliance. but now, the situation has changed.
energy saving lamp
much is said about esl; as if, it is our only saviour in these days of power crisis. while calculating power or energy with conventional electric lamps, such as tungsten filament lamp or florescent tube, the power factor is taken to be unity by electricity supply authorities. but while comparing esl with tungsten filament lamp or florescent tube, it is seen, the power factor of esl is taken as unity and that for conventional lamps is set at 0.8. why is it done? is it to give esl an edge over conventional electric lamps in matters of saving energy ? is the power factor of esl actually unity? does the esl have uniform efficiency all over its life? does its efficiency hold good at all voltage level? what effect does it have on eyes of human beings? a lot of questions like these cross our minds, but nothing of this sort is publicised. the intensity of light of esl is higher than those of conventional electric lamps, no doubt; but its brilliance impinges on the eye. so what should we opt for health or economy?
discourteous!
the other day, i wanted to watch a tv serial on one of the private channels. as is probably true about most other tv programmes, it was also sponsored by a list of commodities/companies. but it was a horrible experience to be repeatedly distracted by commercials coming in the form of courtesy. it is understandable, in the age of market, that one can't expect to gain something, even entertainment, for free; here comes media endorsement of commodities. but too much is simply gross!
biofuel and food security
your staff correspondent's report (sept:15) about an indian ngo personnel (expert?) on the subject is subjective, and should be ignored by all concerned. possibly it relates to the indian scenario, blessed with vast resources of coal, and now also new offshore resources of oil and gas. to some extent food grain as source of biofuel production is used in the us, brazil and a few european countries, and maybe india. however the quantities used are very little compared to their food production; incidentally highly subsidised and surplus to their needs! the fact is that biofuel can be produced from a wide variety of feed stock; like "shapla" growing wild in water bodies that cannot be contained; plant and vegetable refuses of all types, plant stalks, sugarcanes bark, and skins of peeled fruits and vegetables going to garbage! it can also be produced from all types of animal and human solid excreta.

demolition means 'the fragmentation or felling of man-made building or structure'. like any construction, it is a very skilled and sometimes dangerous operation and requires special procedures, if it is to be carried out safely and successfully. with the advancement of technology, 'demolition engineering' has been an area of engineering practice where technology, judgment and experience are utilized in the application of scientific principles and techniques as pertains to design of a certain building or structure.
how building implosions work?
you can demolish a stone wall with a sledgehammer, and it's fairly easy to level a five-story building using excavators and wrecking balls. but when you need to bring down a massive structure, say a 20-story skyscraper, you have to haul out the big guns. explosive demolition is the preferred method for safely and efficiently demolishing larger structures. when a building is surrounded by other buildings, it may be necessary to 'implode' the building, that is, make it collapse down into its footprint.
