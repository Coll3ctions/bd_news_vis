rivers unprotected as ever
to all appearances, the rivers and other water bodies surrounding the capital city see doomed, as the law prohibiting their illegal occupation has never been respected. even a government agency like the bangladesh inland water transport authority (biwta) itself has been found to violate court order by erecting business establishments in the filled parts of buriganga river at sadarghat in the city. it has even built a jetty by filling up shitalakhya river at kanchpur in violation of high court order of june 25, 2009 to demolish all such structures. do these instances not open the door for the vested quarters to go ahead with illegal grabbing with impunity? and what worries us further is that even if in certain cases where the wetland and open spaces conservation act, 2000, has been enforced to bring the violators to justice, they evaded punishment through legal loopholes. that leaves one wondering, if the violators of the river protection law are more powerful than the government and the court?
destroying a teenager's future
what the rapid action battalion has done to the young limon hossain of jhalakati district is a clear outrage. the young man, aged sixteen, has had one of his legs amputated because some trigger-happy member of the force shot him at close range on the unsubstantiated charge that he is a member of a terrorist gang. the truth, as has since become known, is that the rab personnel accosted limon as he stepped out of his home to collect his family cattle, asked him about an individual they were looking for and then shot him the moment he answered in the negative. the young man, who was looking forward to taking part at the hsc examinations the next day, then bled for three hours before being taken all the way to dhaka. by then, his leg had become useless. view the page sports

where has the blue sky gone?
nowadays we do not see the blue colour of the sky, it has been replaced by an ash colour and the smog, created by emissions from vehicles, factories, generators and many other sources, has blanketed the city sky. we are unable to see the star studded night sky; the pollution filled atmosphere has taken it from us.
sprawling urbanisation
the sprawling urbanisation in and around dhaka city is moving at such a pace that very soon it is going to absorb the city's empty spaces as well as the greenbelts. it is also bereft of basic amenities such as playgrounds, parks, walkways. gas, electricity and water crisis is also mounting. it is also alarming to read that the experts have predicted that around 70,000 buildings in dhaka city alone are vulnerable to high velocity typhoon or cyclone, let alone an earthquake. they opined that most of the builders have filled the ditches, canals and low lying lands and started construction without conducting proper soil test which is an important criterion for construction of a building. it was also seen in the past that due to poor construction many buildings either collapsed or tilted. rajuk must ensure that proper roads are being constructed in order to provide access to the rescue team in case a building caves in. it is also alleged that the builders get their plan passed in connivance with a section of corrupt rajuk officials flouting the established building code. we strongly urge the concerned authorities to take stern measures against all these malpractices.
bangladesh team's performance

need for a new terminal at hsi airport
there has been lots of hue and cry over the decision of the present government to set up a new airport away from dhaka. as citizen of a least developed country i consider that the very thought of building a new airport and abandoning the present one is nothing but a unwise idea when the basic infrastructure of the country is yet to be fully developed.
wasa's aims and objectives!
if i am not mistaken, wasa was set up with the idea of providing potable water to urban areas of dhaka, and making water easily available, and also to ensure clean and hygienic sanitation and sewage disposal. all these facilities were installed at huge cost to the taxpayers; but what is the result today? wasa's water supply could not meet the demand, and now it has become a water rationing authority; a function that it enjoys, exercising power and authority by throttling water supply! about sewerage, the less said the better! today, wasa stands for: "water available? sometimes available!" that sometimes will soon dwindle down to two hours out of twenty four in a day!
a true friend of helpless people
it was nobody but dr. yunus who effectively came up with the idea of micro-credit, which indeed came to impoverished people as a blessing and a new hope. most of the people in bangladesh live below the poverty line. dr yunus' grameen bank has always been beside the poverty-stricken people especially in time of their crucial need. it not only enables poor people to manage their daily meals to survive, but also helps the incapable people get proper education. if i am not mistaken, there is not a single government bank that renders student loans to help poor students get education. now bb is after the nobel laureate for his constructive initiatives to eradicate poverty and hunger from this country!
our political philosophies
it is high time to review our political approach and philosophy. the young generation looks to the future but dynasty rulers look into the past. there is huge communication gap between the rulers and the ruled. the politicians ignore the majority of the voters who live in the rural areas. our farmers keep us alive in this fertile land but enjoy no social status.

quota system
i am a freedom fighter's son. my father fought under sector 8. in bangladesh all parties say that they are ready to serve the freedom fighters. the govt. reserved 30% job quota for their children and most recently even for their grandchildren. but practically, no govt. departments or private organisations maintain this quota system. on the other hand, general students claim that they cannot get jobs because of the quota system.
