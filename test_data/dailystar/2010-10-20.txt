a park indeed
since being designated as a children's park in the early nineties, this strip of land at naya bazar in old dhaka has been anything but a place for the kids to play. truckers used it as a parking lot till newspaper reports in 1996 forced dhaka city corporation to reclaim it and install slides, seesaws, swings and other playground equipment. but because of the same dcc's neglect, the amusement tools soon rusted and vanished, and the park became a dumping ground for construction rubbish and sewer sludge. the prime minister's recent order to recover the capital's playgrounds highlights how the little ones in this densely-populated city grow up without much access to outdoor play.

lurking dangers on the highways
roads and highways in the country have regularly been a cause for worry. now that research by the bangladesh university of engineering and technology pin-points the factors behind frequent highway accidents, we believe it is time for action. these are the bare facts the report by buet's accident research unit (ari) has come up with: ten major highways in bangladesh are at high risk where accidents are concerned because 219 black spots have been identified on them. it is not that we are waiting for disaster to strike. the reality is that there have already been as many as 2,515 accidents on these 219 spots, the number of casualties being 2,349. that, again, is not the entire picture as the ari would have us know, for the institute gets only those reports of accidents that the police provide it with. the conclusion is therefore simple: a whole range of other accidents occurring on major roads and highways across the country may very well be going unreported.

the middle east impasse
it was almost a foregone conclusion that the israeli-palestinian peace talks would reach a stalemate after a few rounds of preliminary talks. with the israelis insisting on building new settlements on the occupied west bank lands along with the peace talk, and the palestinians rightly refusing to do so without halting of the construction work, this impasse was inevitable.
make early education interesting
tahiti, my 6-year-old daughter, doesn't want to go to school regularly. she doesn't like her school at all. she says her teacher doesn't love her very much. she has to read 11 books being a student of nursery. the situation is alarming. it is ridiculous that the kindergartens want to teach the students everything to fulfil the demand of the conscious (!) guardians. parents want their children to read more and more from the very beginning of their educational life.
woes of govt. officials
during the last tenure of bnp-jamaat rule, the policymakers appointed their cadres in three tiers- at secretary/additional secretary level, joint secretary level and also deputy secretary level. many of these officers, who are die-hard bnp-jamaat cadres, have been identified and have been removed or retired. many of the bnp appointees have become neutral. but a good number of them are masquerading. they are obstructing the government's development works in subtle ways, helping bnp in indirect ways. their main objective is to bring the present government into disrepute, slow down developmental works and pave ways for bnp-jamaat to come to power. but it will remain a distant dream if the al-led grand alliance plays the cards deftly.
demolishing bgmea building
why do we need to pull down the bgmea corporate office while it is not harming anybody's interests, public or private? a post editorial in the daily star described the logic of pulling down illegally built buildings, though i am slightly of a different opinion. there are a good number of illegally erected buildings in dhaka city. the caretaker government tried to identify such buildings to demolish. but for some unknown reasons, those plans were not accomplished except for the rangs bhaban near the pm office.
political killings
killing a human being for political gains is nothing new in this part of the world. our memory is very short-lived, pretty soon people will forget the brutal killing of late sanaullah noor babu, as we forgot the killing of the deputy speaker of the provincial assembly late shahed ali, who was beaten to death on september 26, 1958.
continue doing good
our dearest rasul (pbuh) has pointed out to us some signs of the 'keyamat', which will be occurring gradually just before the destruction of this world. the premature death of good people, various disasters like earthquakes and cyclones, increase of heinous activities are some of them. all of us should, therefore, keep on doing good work.
war criminals
this awami league government had promised that they would try the war criminals. it is a matter of shame that our country became independent 39 years ago, but those culprits have not been punished yet. i urge the government to speed up the process of the trial of war criminals.
street kids
you can see them walking bare feet on the streets. their clothes are all torn and tattered. you can see their hair in tangles. you can also see the smile on their face when you give them money, no matter how small or big the amount is. when i see these kids smile it brings tears to my eyes. we should do something for these street kids so that they can have a better life.
enemy at home
who is the worst enemy of the awami league? bnp? jamaat? no, awami league itself is its worst enemy. the vile activities of the chhatra league and jubo league are harming the government's image. all the good work of the govt. would be overlooked because of these heinous activities.
save anamika's life
this is in reference to the report published on 7th october 2010, titled “poverty dims ray of hope for little anamika.” thanks to the editor for running the report. it would be great if such reports were published more often to inform us about the needs of the poor.
inspiration from teachers
a teacher's inspiration is very important in a student's life. but we notice that they are fond only of those students who are doing well in exams, but those who are trying to improve do not get any inspiration from their teachers.
pabna to natore
for the last few days i was just contemplating to express my feelings as a general citizen about what happened to the pabna dc who is now facing departmental action for violating the service rules by publicly expressing his helplessness and asking justice from the locals.
religious discrimination
with the annulment of 5th and 7th amendment of the constitution we have virtually gone back to the original constitution of 1972, which was formulated on four fundamental principles including secularism. the spirit of the war of liberation was to create a just and non-communal state in the world map as we had experienced a lot of state-designed communal riots and unrest in the then east pakistan. the pakistani authorities, with bad intensions, unleashed that communal hatred.
impatience everywhere!
everybody is becoming impatient day by day. in the house, office, classroom, street, bazaar, and transport, everybody reacts to other's actions, every now and then. it is observed very often that sons and daughters shout and even become violent against the decisions of their parents. on a trivial matter, one driver beats up another on the busy street, resulting in a massive traffic jam. a rickshaw passenger slaps the rickshaw puller for giving an 'offensive' look. students cannot tolerate their teacher's advice. neighbours and relatives do not come to each other's help. on the contrary, one tries to harass another openly. one's bad luck makes others happy. why are these happening? view the page international
