no logic in the demand
dr anisuzzaman, professor emeritus at dhaka university, in his reaction noted that the bnp had never taken any initiative to try the war criminals when it was in power.
it's blatant disrespect
the demand is a blatant demonstration of disrespect to the sovereignty of the country and its judicial system, said shahriar kabir, executive president of ekattorer ghatok dalal nirmul committee.
resist bnp demands
war crimes facts finding committee (wcffc) convener dr ma hasan has dubbed the bnp's latest demand as another of its efforts to protect the war criminals.

it's nothing new for bnp
sector commanders forum general secretary harun-ar-rashid said the war crimes trial was closed down in december 31, 1975 through a repeal of the collaborators act 1972.

it's worthless

khaleda zia's concerns are welcome
it is rather good to hear opposition leader khaleda zia call the government to account over what she believes are its inefficiency, corruption and mismanagement, all of which have now contributed to the making of an economic crisis for the country. that not everything is right with the country, that indeed our politicians both in government and in opposition have a grave responsibility to turn things around has never been in doubt. we at this newspaper have consistently reiterated our view that a smooth, transparent and therefore accountable practice of democracy in bangladesh is a sine qua non for progress. that indeed has also been the great desire of the people of the country.

and, live happily ever after?
is happiness for real or is it a state of the mind? thomas hardy described happiness as an “occasional episode in a general drama of pain.” hardy has been criticised for “being overly pessimistic about humanity's place in the scheme of things.” we may or may not agree with hardy, but both optimists and pessimists are still struggling with the concept of happiness and the factors that contribute toward making human beings happy. of course, the core question is: what is this illusive emotion, termed happiness? different individuals may have different views, but a generic definition of happiness is: “a mental state of well-being characterised by positive emotions” or, in layman's terms, happiness is the sense of satisfaction we have in life.
