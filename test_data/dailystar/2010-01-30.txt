victory of the rule of law
seldom has a founder of a new state and the supreme leader of any independence struggle met so brutal an end as bangabandhu. not only was he gunned down at the prime of his life (he was only in his mid-fifties) his whole family was also killed including his 10-year-old son russell. both sheikh hasina and sheikh rehana would have also been killed but for their fortuitous trip to germany. there have been other instances of assassination of leaders in history, but seldom if ever, can we find anything remotely similar as the barbarity, the brutality and ruthlessness shown in this case where the whole family was eliminated, including the two newly wed wives of sheikh kamal and sheikh jamal.

ju: convocation and commitment
the 4th convocation of jahangirnagar university (ju) is to be held today, on saturday, january 30, 2010. the university that i proudly headed once is about 40 years old. it implies that the campus so far embraced one convocation every 10 years. this is undoubtedly not good news as far as formal awarding of degrees to the students is concerned. in other countries, and even in private universities in our country, convocation is considered to be an integral part of the performance of the university. convocation is a dream for students and that dream should not be dashed to the ground. view the page sports

climate change: whispering from the sunderbans
due to increased rate of emissions of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone and chlorofluorocarbons) from different sources such as burning of fossil fuels, deforestation and other human activities, the rate of global temperature increase accelerated from +0.6°c over the past century to an equivalent rate of +1.0°c per century in the past two decades (natural resource defence council, usa 2006). sea-level rise as a consequence of global warming is caused by increase in seawater temperatures resulting in thermal expansion of water and melting of glacier and polar iceberg (kennedy et. al. 2002). the climate change has already affected the ecosystems of northern hemisphere including the coastal forests.

when the spirit soars . . .
all journeys have destinations both to and from. there are physical and emotional aspects involved in all such journeys but when added to those is yet another aspect, that is, the spiritual, that makes all the difference. such a journey that is wrapped in an essence of metaphysical or transcendental realm does not have a full stop. it keeps on calling the seeker time and again. an ecstatic state of the mind is felt, a state of unfulfilment stirs up an urge to make one's purpose more meaningful by repeating the path not only to make it more in terms of mere number but also to make it better, to make it near-perfect, which can very well be described as the best way of elevating oneself spiritually. after all, are not we all spiritual beings? the holy kaabah as it stands in the middle of masjid al-haram as an epitome of highest level of spirituality, bears witness to an expression of intense urge of human hearts converging there from all corners of the globe round the year for centuries together.

about secret pacts
there are important lessons to be learnt for bangladesh from the japanese experience with secret deals. while the ldp was in power for over five decades, except for a brief period in 1993, there was persistent accusation from the opposition with considerable public support that japan had entered into secret deals with usa on security. however, the ldp led government was not willing to lend credence to those accusations and perceptions without being able to prove there were no secret deals. when the ldp lost power in the elections last september to the democratic party of japan, one of the first tasks of the new foreign minister katsuya okada was to instruct the foreign ministry for a report about the secret deals. he gave his ministry a year to come up with its findings, acknowledging the fact that it is easy to accuse about existence of secret deals but quite another thing to prove it.
which way afghanistan?
with 30,000 american and 7,000 nato additional troops, it still difficult to judge which way afghanistan is going. there is no cut and dry situation in the treacherous war that is increasingly asking for more blood and money. americans are getting jittery because of few thousand casualties suffered since 9/11 on both fronts. no matter how sophisticated and overbearing the position is it is irrational to think of counterterrorist effort without a price tag in blood and money. military compulsion in afghanistan and political expediency in washington appears on a collision course. the fallout of war on us economy and politics in the sensitive midterm election at the yearend remains as unpredictable as the outcome of the surge of additional troops in afghanistan.

the ailments that undermine education

for women, the hard way to success
the bangla literary giant shomoresh majumdar holds the reader completely engrossed with the gripping story told in heere boshano shonar phool . the characters and the plot of the story are so real that the reader feels as if he or she is witnessing the events as they unfold with each page. the story is a spellbinding drama of a family that comes out of the stereotyped roles of men and women. it is about a young woman, titir, who finds the courage to go out of the four walls of her home defying the old conventions and finding a place of her own in the outside world.
in search of one's roots
india remains, especially for people in the west, a land of mystery and mysticism. paul hyland happens to be one of those drawn to a land that is noted as much for its political history as its cultural heritage. hyland focuses on the latter, a particular reason being that his ancestors once made what was, back in the 1830s, an arduous trip to india and then stayed on to breathe in the aroma and the pungency of a country as varied in its landscape as it was, and is, in its cultural diversity. the author's hundred year-old grandmother, not in the best of health in devon, perks up when grandchild joy speaks of narsapur. and narsapur is what the centenarian associates with her own past. for she was born lily bowden 'at kakinada, on the eastern delta of the river godavari which flows into the bay of bengal'. as hyland takes care to let readers know, only forty years earlier, her grandfather william bowden had been an apprentice stonemason in barnstaple but soon took off, along with his newly-wed wife, for madras.
