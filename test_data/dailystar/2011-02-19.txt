history and politics are so much ingrained into each other in this part of the world that a manifestation of heritage and culture usually involves a projection of the political history of the country. so, it was a moment of great pride for any bangladeshi to witness the rich political history of the nation and the endeavour of its people to gain independence being portrayed so prominently in the opening ceremony of the icc cricket world cup at the bangabandhu national stadium on thursday.

cricket to elevate our image

new dad's baby blues
in our country the first issue is a divine blessing to its parents. the baby brings a festive air from a hut in the slums to the castle. relatives, friends and neighbours shower presents; food, laughter and jokes keep the environment of the house ever warm. the young mother with immense shyness and the granny with profound pride shows off the little prince to the visitors. but the centre of great attraction remains unconcerned, absolutely unaware of the grandeur! it's the day when a man should be over the moon. his friends and colleagues buy him sweets and cigars. his boss pats and says he expects great things of him as he's been more responsible.
