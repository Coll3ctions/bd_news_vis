it is an oft-told story that extremely hazardous particles in the air of dhaka and chittagong pose a threat to the life of the citizens. they literally inhale poison as they go about doing their every-day chore little knowing the long-term effect on their health. the two mega cities are home to millions of people where they are already living in unhealthy environment amidst filth and debris. on top of that, they are forced to breathe air containing lethal components like carbon monoxide, lead, dust etc. it is said things get even worse in winter when particulate matters (pm) in air is likely to be higher than what is recoded in other seasons.
inadequate law on the disabled
the way a state treats its retarded people is a measure of the maturity and sophistication it has attained. meeting the basic needs of the retarded should have nothing to do with being an affluent country or a poor one. the approach to the retarded is essentially a matter of attitude, ethics and culture. even in developing countries, with resource constraints, the mentally and physically handicapped children can be taken care of by private and public sectors joining hands. there is scope to garner endowment funds for them. by imparting special skills many of them can be turned into reasonably productive citizens.
the fall
mikhail gorbachev's rise and role in the former soviet union had always been suspect. the mystery surrounding the introduction of his so-called glasnost and perestroika ultimately resulting in the dissolution of his country still lingers. if he, in a way, catalysed the fall of the ussr, he was in the same vein responsible for the worst ever thing happening to the us -- becoming the world's unrivalled superpower.
war games

a touch of lara
perhaps the best compliment for yuvraj singh, who played one of the finest innings under pressure you can hope to see, would be that he had a touch of brian lara. there was the same high backlift, with the bat flowing down from the eye level, the quick hands, malleable wrists, sensational timing and perfect placement. to top it all, there was the part that couldn't be seen, only sensed: the ability to create a bubble where the external factors -- a fresh pitch with a tinge of green, the hole that his team was in when he walked in, and the fact that he was playing for test spot -- ceased to matter.

facing calamities
the calamity that has once more left lives in bangladesh ravaged calls for some serious rethinking on our part insofar as tackling natural disaster is concerned. there is, of course, no way in which we can prevent nature from venting its fury. throughout the ages bangladesh has been battered by floods, cyclones, tidal surges and the like, and the consequence of it all has always been a trail of devastation left behind. people have died, while those who survived were left homeless and destitute. it is today a tale of all comprehensive misery. with each day that passes, the body count from the disaster gets to be higher. as far as crops are concerned, they have simply been destroyed.
save ‘gharials’
the geographical range of the distribution of gharials (gavialis gangeticus) has dwindled within the natural range countries pakistan, bhutan, india and nepal but more significantly in bangladesh. wild populations can only be found now in bangladesh, india and nepal. only few pairs in the wild are reported to be surviving in the padma-jamuna river system, bangladesh. gharials have been listed as critically endangered in the iucn red list 2007 and have again been identified as the most threatened crocodilian species in the world in a recent resolution of the world association of zoos and aquariums (waza) and world conservation union (iucn) (october 2007). with the rapid increase in the magnitude of threatening ecological and social factors, the gharials in bangladesh are facing their worst nightmare and are at the verge of extinction.
global conference on agriculture
bangladesh being not so a rich country cannot bear frequent losses in the agriculture sector due to natural calamities like flood, cyclone, draught, etc.
global warming
among the real concerns of the after-effect of the sidr hurricane, the political turmoil, the price hike of essentials and the misdeeds of the ex-politicians, most people tend to forget that we, mankind, are at the end of our current pattern of growth and so called civilisation.
choose the right leaders
the tentative schedule of national election has been announced already. the election commission (ec) is making all the arrangements for this election. meanwhile, it is important to know the background of the participating political leaders. it is also essential to know their stand for the development of bangladesh.
eid-ul-azha
cyclone sidr has killed over 450,000 livestock and poultries, wiping out a major source of income for millions of affected families. bangladeshi people and their friends all over the world have responded to assist the affected people in restoring their lives and livelihood. even the poor people have come forward with whatever little they have to help the cyclone-affected families. most impressive was a gesture from some vgf card holders in non-affected areas who volunteered to give up their cards as their contribution to cyclone relief activities. this is the bangladeshi spirit that we are all so proud of and has been upheld again.
trees
the paltry numbers of trees that can be spotted bear a queer burden upon them, to say the least! as they are being subjected to a natural decay owing to the biological grounds, they are unfortunately falling victims to the burden inflicted by the humans as well. the point gets clear if one extends the antenna of one's observation- see how the lone and withered trees in the urban towns are burdened by the sign boards that they are forced to carry on their weary frames. there are, interestingly, the signboards of the coaching centres of a variety of tantalising and at times ridiculous names: sure success, never do fail, nexus, peerless the list would rather go on and on!

biharis in bangladesh
jamshaid taher of banani, dhaka wants the camps closed and the biharis dispersed (star dec.1). this expression of intolerance and disregard for the needs of fellow humans is appalling. is their plight not bad enough as it is without attacking the unfortunate community? they would find work easily, he says. no one would discriminate against them, would they? they would be welcomed by the majority community. i do not think so.
qualification of mp candidates
the present caretaker government seems to be sincere to hold a unique election to be held in 2008. the election commission is also struggling to make it possible by taking different steps. we the general people are happy to observe it. in my view, a free and fair electoral process is mainly dependent on two points;
an accurate voting process for the voters, like; voter list, id card, ballot box etc. and a transparent nomination process for the candidates.
development issue
this caretaker government is only busy with cracking down on the politicians. it is a good thing but they are not concerned with the development of the country. we are suffering from power failure and price hike of commodities. if electricity is not available for 4-5 hours a day, how is it possible for us to keep pace with the other countries of the world?
ctg's job
we all hate war criminals. after 36 years of independence those criminals are still living in our country. we could do nothing against them. a few days ago all the concerned people of bangladesh burst into anger by the remarks of jamaat leaders. because we all know about their heinous work in our liberation war. all the political parties and leaders (except a few) demanded trial of war criminals. but the caretaker govt did not accept that. their opinion is that "they are here to organise a free and fair election. they cannot take extra burden". they also said it is the task of a political govt. in my point of view it is true. but one think the ctg can do. they can organise a mass vote whether the people of bangladesh want the trial of war criminals or not. people will decide about those criminals. which will be very helpful for a political govt to take a decision about the war criminals. the ctg is doing so many things for the welfare of bangladesh. we hope that the ctg will do this also for our collective good.
retirement age
the present non-political government is very passionately considering extension of retirement age limit of the government service holders from 57 to 62 years. it is indeed a very encouraging and pragmatic consideration of the present government in the light of the increased life expectancy of the people due to availability of better healthcare facilities. i personally welcome the decision but in view of limited job opportunities in public sectors, i would like to take the privilege of expressing my reservation without any prejudice on raising the retirement age to 62 years for the following reasons:
relief fund
as an avid watcher of bangladeshi politics, as well as its people's well-being, i have a question about relief fund.
english and business
english is the most important in the world for its international acceptability. our generation has now realised the necessity of learning english and are trying to improve their skills in the language. their realisation is taken as a business opportunity by some so called 'english language teaching centres. this is unfortunate, to say the least.
our responsibility
the cyclone has severely unsettled the lives of millions; as a nation we need to stand behind this calamity and show our fraternity. people of all walks should really come forward and help to mitigate the giant catastrophe that had swept the nation and thousands have died and/or have been maimed. let us ignite our moral fabric, grasp the reality of the cyclone affected people and do whatever in our capacity to help our brothers and sister leading tormented, desperate and hungry lives. let us assuage them for losing their near and dear ones. view the page international

bangladesh is widely known as a flood or natural disaster prone country for many years. in recent times many european countries have also experienced floods. once united states was free from natural calamities, but not now. us people are also afraid with possible revisit of hurricane katrina. why is the world facing such calamities? environmental depletion and global warming are identified as the prime reasons for world wide natural disasters. united states did not take these factors into consideration until recently, though they are one of the accused for these causes. however, though delayed, people all over the world are now concerned about the environmental depletion and global warming. but the irony is that prime victims of these two disasters are nations which are not really responsible for the creation of these disasters.
