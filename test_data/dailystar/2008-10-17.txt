dse trading
the recent debacle in the share market raised concern among share investors. they demonstrate in front of the main bourse of dhaka share market to register their protest over fall of share prices of different companies in which they invested. they brand the price fall of shares as a conspiracy being engineered by the security and exchange commission (sec) which regulates the market. the claim of small shareholders cannot be dismissed outright. when share prices rise once in a blue moon to the great advantage of small holders and continues for two-three days, the sec becomes busy to correct the market by a mechanism not known to the common shareholders. but the sec is not at all concerned when share prices fall which is evident from their activities. at the time of fall, they only issue a press note that there is nothing to worry about, the market will rise automatically. but their premise is not at all correct. the small investors want the sec to correct the bearish market once it goes down and lift it up for the small shareholders. in this case also, the sec can use the mechanism the way they use it to correct the bullish market. when prices of every item go up, right from green chilly to automobiles, then why share prices of different companies will not rise? small investors invested in the share market to make some profit from buying and selling process of different shares. they do not have enough money to start large-scale business in other sectors which requires a lot of money. and that is why they entered the share market as a last resort to do clean business investing whatever capital is left with them.

points to ponder
in a recent tv news, i came across two important news items as below.:
palin's outlandish comment
ridiculous! republican vice presidential candidate sarah palin recently labelled democratic white house hopeful barack obama as a 'friend of terrorists'! i think, republicans, more precisely people within the 'bush circle' are suffering from the 'mistrust and insecurity syndrome'. otherwise, how could palin make such a statement against her own countryman obama who has already proved his patriotism and popularity?
the global crisis
the folly of free market economy and globalisation could not be exposed in a more disastrous way than the fall of wall street and the credit crunch. the preachers of free market economy had been so blind to their dogma of opening the market that it always questioned the common sense.
democratic process derailed
bangladesh is derailed from the democratic track. we had hoped that the ctg would be able to fulfil our expectations. but with the passage of time, the govt. moved away from its strong principled position. forgetting the interest of general people, the have started to act like the much-maligned politicians. view the page international
