delimitation of constituencies
the process of delimitation of constituencies that has got underway is an eminently logical, timely and necessary step. we welcome it. this is in keeping with the need for administrative convenience as well as taking the population density factor into consideration so that the number of voters is about the same in all the constituencies except of course for the hill districts, where there are three seats in all.
a man of unbounded creativity
the death of selim al deen brings to an end the career of a man whose contributions to the cause of literature and theatre in bangladesh have been of an elevated kind. he belonged to that group of young men, back in the days immediately after the liberation of the country, who believed that a new ethos needed to be shaped in aesthetics. it was a constant enrichment of bengali culture that these young men emphasised through their works. and al deen was one individual who believed that a nation's heritage was doomed to decline unless it was endlessly and periodically refurbished by new ideas.
of foreign policy, of scholar diplomats
it is as good a time as any, once more, to raise the issue of where bangladesh's diplomacy is going. or you could ask if there is any diplomacy at work, if there is a foreign policy that we can truly call our own. something there is about the structure of our diplomacy that is deeply worrying. one would have thought that the tranche of reforms the caretaker government took upon itself to pursue and implement would include a very fundamental need to recast the modalities upon which the country has been interacting with nations around the world.

spiralling prices
i want to convey my sincere thanks to dr. m. moniruzzaman for his article on price stability published in the daily star on 4 january 2008. he has dissected the root cause of volatile market instability and suggested how we can come out of this problem and counter the situation in the coming days. it (scarcity of rice) may worsen due to increasing population and loss of cultivable land due to natural disasters like global warming or floods. while reading the article, i remember that in 1973-74, we used to go weekly to bring rice, wheat, edible oil, butter oil, salt and sugar from nearby ration dealer and it's stamped with date in that card that we took the ration for the said duration. so, no one could have their ration before the next scheduled date. now, the government should handle the situation strongly and must implement vgd, vgf, tr, rmp and ffw to help the poor and vulnerable groups.

global warming and america
americans are experiencing their worst nightmare of natural catastrophes such as wild forest fire, storms, blizzards, heavy rains etc. millions of americans are now rendered homeless in different states having no shelter, food and power due to all these natural calamities. now the question is, seeing all these miseries of their own people, will the bush administration become serious enough to go for the resolution to actively participate in lessening global warming? as we all know, global warming is the main cause of all these disasters. we also believe that now it is time that the recently concluded seminar in bali, indonesia, on global warming should act as an eye opener for americans and they must participate and take the leading role to contain global warming.
sheikh hasina's treatment
the four specialist professors have every right to give opinion as to the medical condition of their patient. it, however, is pretty odd for physicians to suggest a definite country for the purpose of treatment. as i can gather from the newspapers reports, sheikh hasina is suffering from multiple disease processes including hypertension, eye problem (not specified in the news report) and hearing problem. it is also suggested that she might be suffering from kidney problems too.
wake up!
in my opinion the learned society of bangladesh does not do enough to pressurize the government into making some significant decisions. i draw on the example of the internet tariff set by bttb. in an article published by the daily star on 31/12/2007 we, the general people, got to know about the bttb's myopic vision. it seems we have left it for india to earn easy cash! does it not strike them that with reduced rates there will be a huge number of people taking their services which in turn will be a win-win situation for the govt., bttb and the people. the private sector can then groom the unemployed youths and provide an avenue for 'significant employment'. we are already lagging behind and still our authorities don't take effective decisions which could benefit the nation.
ppp in post-benazir era
keeping in line with the politics of dynasty, pakistan and the ppp has again proved it could not rise above the petty ideals of short-term political gains. they had to elect benazir bhutto's son and father to lead the party! the latter is already smeared with an aura of corruption and the former is an untested adolescent with no political experience whatsoever. unfortunately, the same goes for current bangladesh. even after the massive changes of 1/11, the political dynasties seem to enjoy significant control over the national politics. it is still quite difficult to imagine a political landscape without sheikh hasina or khaleda zia.
phensidyl menace
quite frequently we come across news reports on tv and newspaper that a huge number of indian phensidyl bottles have been seized or destroyed by the law enforcing agencies.
comments
mohammad badrul ahsan's write-up “curse or coincidence” explains the tragedy that has befallen the bhutto family. but he misses out two very important points -
rice shortage and solution
there was an article about recent food shortage in bangladesh on the 4 january issue of the daily star.
wanted: new leaders
we have burning examples in front of us of our "leaders" having corrupt sons. how can some people seek again their leadership knowing very well that if they cannot control their children at home they cannot control/govern a country?
can we try constitutional monarchy?
it seems that the present government has been trying to get the country's two politically dominant families zia family and bangabandhu family off politics since the interim administration came to power a year back. they have so far tried a number of options that include keeping hasina and khaleda out of the country and replacing them as heads of their respective political parties the al and the bnp. i think these efforts will not succeed, as these steps by nature go against human rights and are unacceptable to all democracy-loving people both inside and outside the country or, at least, these would look odd in such an emerging democracy, unlike pakistan. besides, even though these are done, they will merely be temporary, as we have observed in the cases of nawaz sharif and benazir bhutto in pakistan. under the circumstances, the present government can try an option of setting up constitutional monarchy that will replace the current position of the president of bangladesh with queen or king. under this formula, the bangabandhu family will be made the royal family with no political powers while the zia family will be put on the 'free market politics' (real competition in elections) where the 'market forces' (quality of competing parties and leaders) will determine the value of the bnp with zia family at the party helm. if the present government organises a referendum before introduction of such a monarchy, the whole thing will be democratic as well as legitimate.
women bashing
women in our country are always the target of violence and oppression. they are to be dominated by men--the stronger sex. this is a common scene in bangladesh--a country where the independent thinking of a woman is very much subjected to social criticism. in our country women cannot get the recognition that they deserve because their credibility is suppressed by the conservative mentality of society. a woman working alone on her own would often have to endure ugly remarks thrown at her if her job is considered “disrespectful” when it is not. for instance, a woman working as a garments worker whose wage is poor may fall victim to insulting comments which she may or may not be able to wash off her hands. sometimes, working overtime especially in late hours may cause an unfortunate female worker to become susceptible to sexual assaults. a housewife would often have to pay a comparatively higher price for the same kilogram of vegetables when her male counterpart would easily get away with paying a lesser price. a desperate mother who is a single parent working after 6.00pm would be teased and be a topic of backbiting in our society when all she is to be blamed for is to choose to earn her own living for her children, instead of sitting idle at home. these are some of the many examples of discrimination which the women in our country face every day and there is nothing to do about it.
our hopes
a new year has once again begun with new hopes and dreams. the last year was not a good one for our country as the catastrophic sidr and floods struck the southern areas, leaving millions homeless. our achievements and expectations are not so high still we, bangladeshis, are resilient and invincible and will never give up. the sidr struck people have once again started building their houses, cultivating paddy and thus getting life started anew. but some of them are still being neglected and are just dreaming of at least some help coming which will enable them to build up life once again. people who are well off can extend a hand towards them. they can donate foods and clothes to those people who have a real need at this moment.
double standards
the nation is shocked by the way the learned teachers and the students have been dealt with. we consider it a shame for all of us.
cry for democracy
the outcry by the local political leaders for democracy in bangladesh continues as usual. but if we carefully analyse the interests behind this outcry it becomes very clear that their cries are merely for their own benefits. they merely use democracy as a means to grab power, a ladder to climb on to the top. unfortunately, very few political leaders in bangladesh ever practised democracy when they were in any kind of power. that is why we saw whenever they were in power the leaders made their brothers or sisters mps, brother in laws ministers, nephews and cousins ministers, sons future leaders of the parties, irrespective of their qualifications or experience! they do not like to see democracy within their own parties/institutions, in their ways of business. they are intolerant to any kind of opposition. they like democracy only when the result of an election goes in favour of them. they are not ashamed of rigging the election to get their own candidates elected. they are not ashamed of modifying election rules to influence the election. even after all these, if the outcome goes against them they start crying foul, start street agitation. they do not care about ordinary people being killed.

when the shah of iran lost his throne . . .
on january 16, 1979, mohammad reza pahlavi, aryamehr, light of the aryans, shahinshah of iran, left tehran with his royal family for what was given out as a holiday. within iran and in the outside world, though, it was known only too well that the shah and his family would never return to take charge of their kingdom again. the kingdom had reached its final stages of collapse, even though the increasingly beleaguered monarch had put his final hopes on shahpour bakhtiar, the prime minister he was leaving in charge.
if only ...
if only we could stick to our respective assigned tasks and did what we knew best, instead of unduly interfering into others' territory of operations and expertise, surely things would have been far less complicated and it would have been easier to salvage and sustain whatever progress we have made so far. just consider this, how would the scenario appear if the cobbler all too suddenly turned into a goldsmith, likewise a rickshaw puller into a racing car driver or, for that matter, a fruit seller into an economist. frankly, most of us are doing exactly all that we are not supposed to, and for which we are not duly qualified either.
self reliance for food security
with empty shelves in caracas, food riots in west bengal, mexico, morocco, mauritania, senegal and yemen, warnings of hunger in jamaica, nepal, the philippines and sub-saharan africa, soaring prices of basic foods all around the globe have brought into light a looming global food crisis. in the recent past, argentines boycotted tomatoes when the vegetable became more expensive than meat; and in italy, shoppers organised a one-day boycott of pasta to protest rising prices; the russian government, hoping to ease tensions, announced a price freeze for milk, bread and other foods.
the protection business
in iraq there are about 78,000 armed individuals dubbed concerned local citizens (clcs). their jobs: to protect their fellow iraqis, staff checkpoints and help rid the country of terrorists. they're also pulling down a collective $23.4 million monthly, at $10 a day each. joining the united states to defeat al-qaeda and assorted insurgents is a noble enough endeavor that carries considerable risk, but it is also a sizable business. and in a country where tribal allegiances are paramount and loyalty to outside entities fluid, the chance to make money and gain power -- not national pride -- may be the key drivers for the iraqis' civic activities. view the page star city
