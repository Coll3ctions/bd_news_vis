appalling conditions at jagannath university
an entirely untenable situation has been created at jagannath university. there can be no denying that the manner in which twelve dormitories of the university have been under illegal occupancy for the last so many years has brought conditions to a pass where both teachers and students of the university now feel that urgent action is necessary to correct conditions. the outburst that was noticed in old dhaka a few days ago was, given the realities of the situation, a reaction to old grievances that successive governments have either ignored studiously or have not had time to pay attention to. the present government, having been elected to office with a massive mandate, has made it clear (and that was in light of the students' outburst) that it will not tolerate any violence at academic institutions.

more food, less fear, will win the future
can you win a general election without winning the argument? curiously, both the ruling coalition and the principal opposing alliance seem to think so. the government has a vested interest in fudge. after all, there can be no opposition if there is no position. its best hope is to muddle through the april-may poll and return with roughly the same numbers through a strategy of least resistance.
where does the government stand?
the massive mandate received by the mohajote has thrust upon the prime minister the great responsibility of meeting the aspirations of the people. to improve the condition of the people the government may have to invest a huge amount of money. where will the government get the resources from, given the habitual reluctance of the rich and the powerful to pay taxes and, as seen during the period 2001-2006, to steal wealth of the state, along with the drying up of external capital in the form of assistance and foreign investment? view the page sports

price control and traders
there is a tendency among us to look down upon traders, industrialists and, in general, people involved in trade and commerce. historically, trade and commerce have been the foremost and primary occupation of the human race. all other branches, like armed forces, bureaucracy, etc., were formed to safeguard, protect, sustain and enhance commercial activities. all wars were fought to protect or to expand commercial interests. the east india company used to have its own forces and also was the precursor of the indian civil service. jonathan company of the netherlands had its own civil-military outfits in south africa. so, there is no scope or rationality to look down upon 'commerce people'.
