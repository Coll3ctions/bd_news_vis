tax evasion culture
the very low tax-gross domestic product (gdp) ratio at around 9 per cent coupled with the people's tendency to evade paying tax has been a major hurdle before the revenue administration's effort to fulfil the government's revenue collection target every year. as a result, the amount of revenue collected annually is too low compared to the population's actual potential to pay taxes. small wonder the government has to meet the budgetary gap through borrowing from banks and foreign aid.
inculcating sense of history
a sense of history is the foundation upon which a society finds a niche for itself in the global scheme of things. in bangladesh, given the various distortions which have crept into our history, inculcating a sense of history in the young is of seminal significance. that is why the government move to provide a fifteen-volume work on war of liberation free of cost to nearly 17,000 school and colleges is welcome. the initiative toward this laudable exercise was of course taken by the last caretaker government, for which it deserves credit. it is our expectation that the present elected government will eventually fulfill this onerous responsibility of bringing our young population level with the history of the country, particularly in relation to the war of liberation and the events that preceded it. view the page sports

if laws and rules bring despair…
the essence of democracy is to have laws, rules and procedures etc that bring happiness to the majority of people. our rulers, however, think otherwise. while explaining the yunus issue to our foreign friends, one senior minister resorted to falsity. another, while embarking on her mission of mercy to bring solace to our brethren ejected out of libya, said with a straight face that no matter how many people lose their joy and happiness, the law must prevail. the question therefore is: if a law or a rule brings despair, grief, sorrow (opposite of joy/happiness) to the vast majority of the people (80% ++ if the opinion polls are to be believed), then, if we profess to be a democratic state, should not that particular law, go, be dumped and scrapped instead of the person affected by it?
be proud of bangladesh
i am cent percent satisfied with the performance of bangladesh cricket team in the world cup 2011. just take a look; we have won three matches out of six. we have beaten england, ireland and netherlands. some people talk about the shameful defeats against south africa and the west indies. in 1992 world cup, pakistan team scored only 76 runs (against england). but afterwards they took the trophy! to me, the only point bangladesh should think about is sensible batting. my request to bcb, please make sporting wicket, not slow wicket. bangladeshi pace bowlers are also good and our batsmen are good in fast and sporting wicket.
we are grateful
i am writing from pakistan. i thank all bangladeshi cricket fans for supporting pakistan cricket team during the quarter-final match. i wish one day bangladesh would play a match in pakistan, and we would wave bangladeshi flags in support of our guest team in a future cricket world cup. we would like to convey our message of love and peace to our brothers and sisters in bangladesh.

we stand by you, japan
our sincere condolences go to the people and government of japan. in particular to the bereaved families who lost their near and dear ones during the natural calamity of unprecedented magnitude. this is a very difficult time for the people of japan. to add to the misery, nuclear plant blasts sent another wave of profound shock to the japanese people. some of the areas where earthquake and tsunami hit are known to me personally. japanese are resilient, diligent and extremely positive-minded people who will overcome these appalling catastrophes. and japan is a tested friend of ours and always stands by us through thick and thin. at this time of great disaster, we would like to assure our japanese friends that our continuous prayers and heartfelt sympathies are with them.

wrath of the government
it has become clear why our prime minister and her government stood against prof yunus and grameen bank. after the rejection of yunus' writ petition in the court against bangladesh bank's order to remove yunus from his office, attorney general mahbub-e alam made it clear that if anyone was supposed to get a nobel peace prize in bangladesh it should have been either sheikh hasina or shantu larma. the government though failed to give attention to the country's serious problems such as power crisis, gas crisis, water crisis, population explosion, traffic jam, price hike of daily commodities and many other issues; it was able to remove prof yunus from grameen bank not considering its long-term effect not only in the country but throughout the world.
govt. and opposition should work together
this is the 40th year of our independence. we want to be more optimistic and confident that our country will go ahead towards economic development, peace, prosperity, and self-sufficiency. we want the commitment of change to turn into reality. our last year's list of achievements is considerable.
