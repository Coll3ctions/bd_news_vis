sluggish adp implementation
from july to october of the current fiscal year, only 13 percent of the annual development plan (adp) has been implemented, indicating a two percent increase from the level recorded in the first quarter of the last fiscal. but this is only notional; for, even this tiny increase seems worked off by the whittled down size of the current adp itself. the size is 3.39 percent lower than that of the last fiscal year's original adp.

a good move spoiled
i want to draw the attention of the people responsible for the brand new viewer participatory live programme on rtv aired at 9:45pm on november 27, 2008 called 'jibone jibone anaea" concerning drug issues sponsored by many important stakeholders of the country. i surely think the time and intention of the programme was absolutely contemporary with the fact that over 45,00,000 youths are affected by drug dependency in bangladesh. especially, for people like us who in some way or the other are connected to the cruel effects of drug dependency - it is a sign of hope that ngos, multinationals and even national organisations are coming forward to assist the experts in the field to contain the national drug problem. once the sponsors agree upon buying expensive slots of air time to sensitise the masses on any issue, the responsible people could explore more before commencing such a programme. the programme started with a video clip (poorly made to the context of the programme) portraying a true story of an unfortunate death of a boy, focusing on the interviews of the dead boy's sister and father who witnessed the boy killing himself. the story immediately made the viewers anguished and terrified. and surprisingly there was no rescue! the facilitator talking with the experts even stood in the way while they tried to uncover the story and direct the viewers to a point from where they could see the light of hope. in the cases of drug dependency, denial of the problem is a common stage of mind for the victims as well as for the caregivers that leads to severe consequences. we tend to hide our dear ones from the bad name just as he/she does. a sensitisation programme on drug awareness programme with such a story will only make people even more nervous and force them into a deeper shell of denial.
indian visa
this is in response to dr. sn mamoon's letter in your daily, dated 30/11/08. like myself there would be hundreds who would agree with him on the sufferings that the people have to go through, only to get a visa, the high officials of the embassy have no clue as to what goes on outside. the rude behaviour doesn't remain confined to the “police”, “brokers” and “guards” but goes on to the counter people.
bsf atrocities
how could a drunk soldier of the bsf of india intrude at late night inside another country with his arms and go on a shooting spree, killing three innocent members of two families, while injuring 10 others, rendering two families destitute?
wrong information
your staff correspondent's incisive report on the false date of birth declaration by a top leader published on 1st. december has to be dealt with impartially by the election commission. as stated from school records, and confirmed by the controller of examinations of the secondary and higher secondary education board the date of birth is september 5, 1947 and not august15, 1947 as given in the declaration. under the ec rules, the nomination paper should be rejected if it contains wrong information.
talk show experts
i was very upset listening to a few so called "civil society" members on the issue of lifting the state of emergency. they are telling us that the ordinary people of bangladesh will feel more comfortable if the election is held under the state of emergency. on our behalf, would you, sir, kindly ask the same people whether they like the old british rule, ayub-yahya rule, martial law or semi martial law for bangladesh ? they might be confused; but the answer might be: they would prefer the "old british rule". i am pretty sure these elite group of people might find my observation ridiculous and irrelevant; as i consider their comment about the state of emergency harmful, undemocratic and unpatriotic. these gentlemen are misusing their name and fame (?) guided by strong political choice never made public, but can easily be assumed by their acts and deeds. they are perhaps arguing for a permanent system of "state of emergency". their main political choices are a. upazila election, b. national caretaker government, c. the much needed “national security council”, and finally a referendum on their political agenda; alternatively, the party coming to power must be of their choice and preference.

where's our obama?
if obama will ever live up to the level of expectation he is coming in with remains to be seen. but, there is no doubt that he has awakened the better spirit of most americans if not that of most around the world. i cannot help but wonder how it would be to have a bangladeshi version of obama to lead our desperate nation out of the misery we just cannot seem to shake. like many i thought the time may have arrived for bangladesh to leave behind the politics and politicians of the past and move in a better direction where good leaders will take reign of the country; but like a recurring nightmare we are back to square one again. the country is set to elect one of the two “incompetents” again. why? is it really true that people get the leaders they deserve? what do we have to do to deserve our obama?

cell phone menace
now mobile phone has reached every corner of the country. we are getting the facilities offered by this remarkable modern device. it is advancing our life. it is making easier to communicate with each other. however, problem is created when some people misuse this blessing of science. some boys, who are so much curious to collect the girls' cell-phone numbers, have turned it into a device for annoying others. their idea is to impress the girls and develop a so-called relation through the mobile phone. the boys often create serious problems for the girls in the name of developing friendship.
meeting of the two
defying the incomprehensible and unrealistic ego, sk. hasina wajed and begum haleda zia, who have long been known to be the inhabitants of two opposite poles, came face to face and exchanged greetings. this apparently positive attitude could well be the ginning of a new political culture in this country. they should pledge to continue a healthy elationship based on respect and tolerance for each other and show signs of political and mental maturity. these virtues have remained unfamiliar to them. the dagger's end rel-ationship between the top leadership has not only distanced the two political parties but has also created animosity, hatred and intolerance among the field level workers and ordinary supporters as well. if this good neighbourly gesture between mrs. wajed and mrs. zia is confined to exchange of greetings and sharing of home made delicacies alone, i don't think any remarkable qualitative change is going to happen regarding democratisation of political system of this country.

business ethics
today world business is the most important topic. like every other activity, business too has it's own ethics and rules, which should to be followed honestly. tempted by the desire of gleaning fat profit, businessmen often indulge in nefarious activities like adulteration, hoarding, black-marketing, smuggling etc which are very detrimental to the economy. adulteration is a threat to public health. hoarding obstructs the smooth and steady growth of the economy. black-marketing causes inflation, deprives the government of substantial monetary resources that could be used for social welfare. smuggling is another anti-social activity that drains away the country's resources and hinders economic growth. the businessmen community should follow business ethics. view the page international

watchmen
a complex, multi-layered mystery adventure, "watchmen" is set in an alternate 1985 america in which costumed superheroes are part of the fabric of everyday society, and the “doomsday clock” -- which charts the usa's tension with the soviet union -- is permanently set at five minutes to midnight. when one of his former colleagues is murdered, the washed up but no less determined masked vigilante rorschach sets out to uncover a plot to kill and discredit all past and present superheroes. as he reconnects with his former crime-fighting legion -- a ragtag group of retired superheroes, only one of whom has true powers -- rorschach glimpses a wide-ranging and disturbing conspiracy with links to their shared past and catastrophic consequences for the future. their mission is to watch over humanity...but who is watching the watchmen? view the page op-ed
what is at stake
i would like to highlight our accomplishments in one area, the economy. this happens to be the area of most concern to the largest majority of our people. the one economic achievement that impacted the greatest proportion of our population was our extremely successful control of inflation. even through the asian financial crisis of the late 90s we kept inflation at a steady 1.59%. the price of rice stayed at tk. 12-15 per kilo. for only the second time in bangladesh's history we produced a surplus of grain and were even able to export a significant amount. can you guess when we were self-sufficient in grain production for the first time? it was under the previous awami league government of my grandfather, bongobondhu. not only could the bnp government not match this the first time they were in power, but when they returned to power they promptly turned our surplus into a deficit, resulting in increasing prices once again.
recrossing the stream
heraclitus once observed that no man crosses the same stream twice, because the stream has changed, and so has the man. in bangladesh, a transition from civilianised military rule is about to come to an end just as the stream of representative democracy through elections is beginning to gather strength. as it grows into a broadening river, and then become a torrent, the bangladesh nationalist party would cross and recross it, striving to alter its course and, at each stage, being itself subtly altered in its goals and vision.
beginning of a dream
act upon your dream. today, in bangladesh there is a sense of utter hopelessness and uncertainty for reasons we all know. none of us can say for sure what lies ahead for us. there is a sense that there is nothing we can do as citizens to change the course of our fate.
weighing the odds
in early september, dark despair was coursing through the core of the bnp. from the top brass to the rank and file, there was a hardening awareness that to go to elections in barely two months time would be to court disaster. for some, the talk was no longer defeat, but outright annihilation. a boycott was in serious play.
looking forward 
election for the ninth parliament is almost knocking at the door. all political party activities are with an eye towards election at the moment. election manifesto or future programs of political parties have created lots of curiosity and interest especially among the conscious citizens. at the same time these are also under critical scrutiny of the people. here i present some of the programs that the jatiya party pledges to put in place, if it is part of the government after the upcoming elections.
