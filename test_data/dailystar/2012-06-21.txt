industrial unrest in ashulia
we are hopeful that the statement made by state minister for labour and industry can deliver on the promise to have factories in the troubled ashulia industrial humming again after saturday next. the bgmea and bkmea ordered all factories to shut down on june 11 for an indefinite period until the government took constructive steps to ensure the security in the industrial zone and bring those responsible for vandalism in some industrial units to book. needless to say that the estimated $10million lost every day by the readymade garments (rmg) factories and tens of thousands of workers being unemployedin the area is not at all welcome news. though the legality of the shutdown by owners has been challenged in the high court, there is no guarantee that violence will not flare up again once factories resume operations.

begum sufia kamal in 1971: the poet at war
in our adolescence we had not taken begum sufia kamal's poetry very seriously. after all, we were the children of the sixties. our literary sensibilities were framed by pound and eliot, plath and pasternak, ginsberg and neruda, bishnu dey and jibanananda das, subhas mukhopadhay and faiz ahmed faiz, shamsur rahman and al mahmud. we had little patience for the orderly meters, the lilting cadences, and the over-wrought rhymes that marked the poetry of our earlier generations. farrookh ahmed, ahsan habib, golam mostafa, jasimuddin, and others essentially followed the same poetic concerns and conventions, though ahmed was more overtly islamic, and jasimuddin had carved out his niche in folkish pastoralism. we would often dismiss them as "versifiers" rather than as poets.
