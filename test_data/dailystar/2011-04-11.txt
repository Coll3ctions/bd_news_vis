horoscopes, no good!
horoscopes are now widely published in the columns of newspapers every day. people who predict how lucky one will be, based on whatever methodology, and doesn't make sense. and the prophet (pbuh) said, "whoever went to a fortune-teller and asked him about some matter (i.e. of the unseen) and believed him, would have his prayer rejected for forty days."

interest rates of saving certificates
officials, pensioners, small businessmen and others purchase govt. saving certificates as a safe saving instrument, because they do not have the ability to bear big risk. until a few years back the interest rates of saving certificates were quite attractive for this group of people. but in recent years, persistent pressure from the dhaka stock exchange and chittagong stock exchange led the govt. to reduce the interest rates of saving certificates substantially in the name of boosting capital market. as a result, small savers rushed to the capital market but recent bubble there made them paupers. so, the govt. should give priority to the interest of small savers rather than the interest of the members of dse and cse.

we are very saddened by the news of the removal of prof yunus by the present government. what are we showing to the world by this action? we are telling the world that we have not yet overcome our petty party politics, where even the supreme court is highly biased and always acts in favour of the prime minister. please do not let this happen. we, the bangladeshi americans feel that we have been betrayed by the politicians and so-called educated people of bangladesh. some of our colleagues at work asked me why dr. yunus was removed from the bank which he established to help the poor people of bangladesh. i could not answer them clearly.
displaying qur'an
i loved the article by mr. mahfuz anam, published on 6th of april, 2011. i feel it would have been better if the prime minister spoke out about the issues highlighted in that article. islam condemns violence, and qur'an is not something to display during protests. i think this has happened for the first time that the qur'an has been used during protests. furthermore, there are many people who have not even read qur'an, but when it comes to protesting and condemning others, they will do it gladly. recently, there was one youth who was protesting the injustice to muslims, and he was using slangs. i wish i could ask him if using slang was allowed in islam. i hope muslims set their priorities straight practice what you preach!
the last tiger
it is heartening that a tiger rescue service (star magazine, 18 mar 11) has been initiated. trs needs all the encouragement and funds to protect the 400+ tigers remaining. the report incorrectly stated that the last wild tiger, sundarbans apart, was killed in bhawal madhupur in the 40s. in the winter of 1961-62, while proceeding up a steep slope in dense jungle at about 8 am to my timber extraction site from my camp about 8 miles upstream of chema jhiri in bandarbans, i suddenly became aware of a strange silence prevailing all around. i stood still at one end of the narrow path. suddenly a large tiger silently emerged from the undergrowth on to the path at the other end (maybe 20 yards away), stopped and for an eternity, we looked at each other. then it disappeared.
