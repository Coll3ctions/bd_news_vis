a new spectre haunting the americans
america's second new president of this millennium barack obama already has got popularity, for his naive approaches different from that of the last president, in the muslim world. last year move for building mosque at ground zero is another step in this process. president obama defended the right of the muslims to build a 13 storey cultural center and a mosque to be named cordoba house. this decision raised the wave of condemnation; flurry of loath from mass people across the us. in protests americans depicted their view points regarding the issue with racial; anti-islamic beliefs. one placard had - 'mosques breed radical islam, radical islam breeds terrorists' and below that 'not all muslims are terrorists but all terrorists are muslims'. in fact the reactions from americans on these issues are the indicator of their mindset on the question of islam or the role of the us in middle east. surely we didn't forget that though mr. g. w. bush invaded afghanistan in 2001 and iraq in 2003 he didn't loose his presidentship. he was reelected by those americans. hence, it can be assumed that events had been taken place for last few years by the us government in middle east and by americans within the us has a common trait or a common tendency of islamophobia. do they want to suppress muslims or islam in forms they find? are the americans islamophobic?

the ekushey boi mela is that annual experience that must seep into your being. it is the same with the hay-on-wye festival that you wish you could be part of every may in britain. there is then the kolkata book fair that many of us would not want to miss, given that kolkata remains a symbol of bengali intellectual attainment on both sides of the political frontier. here in dhaka, you could safely venture to suggest, the ekushey book fair has increasingly been turning into a defining aspect of life in this free republic of bangladesh. yes, there is yet that certain feeling that reading is a habit fast dying out in this country. and yet as you push through those crowds at bangla academy (this year the stalls have spilled over on to the road, to our intense happiness), you feel that sure sense of elation coursing through you, all in the knowledge that bengalis do read. ah, but if they don't or have lately stayed away from books, they are reinventing themselves. hardly anyone walks away from the ekushey boi mela without a book or two.
