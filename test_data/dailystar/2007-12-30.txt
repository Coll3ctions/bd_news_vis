... and now confusion over how she died?
tragedy is being reduced to the ludicrous. the assassination of benazir bhutto is shocking enough with ramifications not only for pakistan but also for the region as a whole. but now the pakistan government comes up with the questionable theory that the former prime minister died not from any gunshot wounds or bomb explosion but from hitting her head on the levers of the sunroof on her vehicle. a successful assassination has taken place, with three shots being fired at her before her assailant blew himself up. for the islamabad authorities now to inform people that a hit on her head as she ducked killed her is not only bizarre but looks like a clear attempt to evade responsibility over their failure to ensure security for the ppp leader. what about all the eye-witness accounts, report by attending doctors, etc.

possible aftermath of the elections
there is little doubt that mankind's evolutionary journey for the most optimum ideological system of governance in the "universalisation of western liberal democracy" as the end point of history is yet to be arrived at. the inequity one sees, particularly in the least developed countries like bangladesh, in people battered by poverty created by both man and nature, lends credence to some scholars' economistic (capitalism versus socialism) theory of democratic development whereby "the developmental principle of democracy is vitiated by the extractive principle of capitalism."

rules and regulations
formation of the regulatory reform commission (rrc) and the idea of circulation of drafted rules & regulations for public opinion (source: the daily star, 14-12-07) is certainly a praiseworthy measure. it could make us, general citizens, conscious and protected from unexplained harassment-- the harassment we faced in the past due to absent or hidden public rules and regulations.
university teachers
despite all hope for a "honourable" solution of the recent du incidents, the issue seems to be getting into a “black hole”. as an ordinary citizen we would once again request the government not to take any steps which would lead them to a point of no-return. that would only further destabilise the overall situation prevailing in the country including the present quest for democracy.
our education system
the education system of our country, after 36 years of independence, still remains the same. only the grading system has been introduced and every year a large number of students pass their ssc and hsc examinations acquiring golden gpa-5. but still the main problem in this case is that the books published by the national curriculum & text book boar cannot be compared with the international standards. the syllabuses prescribed by the board which direct the students to do their studies in a planned way are mostly not practical. and majority of bangla-medium students can't even speak english fluently, despite their knowledge of grammar and the introduction of fm method, communicative english and such other processes. in addition to this, the english books of primary level truly lack in quality and standard. most of the ssc examinees memorise the essays, paragraphs, letters etc. from which they surely get one in the examination and they can easily pass without the ability to write freely in english.

reforms and election
the political history of the south asian subcontinent is fairly old and eventful. in fact, formal organisational politics in south asia started with the formation of the indian congress in 1885. the muslims of india emerged as a separate political entity with the formation of muslim league about a hundred years back. it is, indeed, a shame for our politicians that we failed to provide truly democratic politics to our people despite having a long political past. the political bankruptcy that we now encounter is the legacy of negligence, disregard, and the feudalistic attitude of our leaders over the years. view the page star city
