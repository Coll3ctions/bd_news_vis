unending 'crossfire' deaths
the latest report by ain-o-salish kendra makes dismal reading. in the past three months, according to the report, as many as thirty individuals have died in so-called crossfire incidents in the country while twenty five others died in police custody. by any standard of morality as well as legality, these incidents are appalling in nature. they fly in the face of the government's claims that no 'crossfire' deaths have occurred in all the time since it took office in january 2009. now contrast that with a recent ministerial comment to the effect that crossfire killings have seeped into the system and it will take time for such killings to be brought to an end. such contradictory positions are disturbing.

bizarre cricket mania
cricket fans in the subcontinent have increased the pressure on players and coaches, which makes them anxious and stressed. the result is there for all to see. the people of the subcontinent should not forget that their teams too entered the tournament as underdogs years ago. why should they raise a hue and cry when other teams outplay theirs? the hysterical outburst at bangladesh's defeat to west indies exposes our self-centred expectations. if our players do not perform, we denounce them. but one thing is for certain this bizarre cricket mania is the result of the unreasonable media hype. it has made us so crazy that we have lost the ability to accept defeats. it was saddening to see fans attack the house of bangladesh captain. do the people ever lift a finger against erring government officials or politicians who are involved in scandals?
william and kate to protect bengal tigers
it is inspiring to learn that a portion of the charitable gift fund to be raised on the occasion of the royal wedding of prince william and kate middleton will be spent on the conservation of bengal tigers of the sundarbans. this gesture would definitely help stop the poaching of tigers, elephants and other endangered animals and ensure their protection and conservation.the number of tigers in the sundarbans and elsewhere in the world has decreased alarmingly due to the human activities including cutting of forests. an indonesian proverb makes the point clear as it states:

ricky, the man
ricky ponting has always been a man of character. he is often criticised for his harsh behaviour, but for the responsibility this man has been carrying through for last eight years with great determination and sheer success, he has to keep an attitude that no ordinary man bears. he is a captain with the ability to win a match from any condition. winning consecutive world cup title was no small achievement. the opponent captains often misunderstand him. but in my opinion he is simply a man who has self believe and competes hard on the field.

psc is wasting time
psc is taking a long course of time to recruit the bcs cadres. in fact, many brilliant students leave this field because of lengthy procedure. tight civil administration plays a pivotal role for the continuous development of a country. for instance, if we look at the most developed countries like usa, uk, japan, germany, etc., we can say that the rigid base of democracy in those countries is the outcome of efficient civil administrations. the politicians can't do whatever they like rather opinions of mass people are taken into account in those countries. to minimise the course of time for accomplishing the total procedures of bcs exams the present govt. should act promptly.
make yunus the next president
the leader of the opposition in parliament expressed deep shock and concern at the way the nobel laureate has been humiliated by the regime in power. since then i have been wondering as to how his honour and dignity could be restored. it is indeed a matter of serious disgrace. to speak the truth, many a people throughout the globe know bangladesh because of dr. yunus. the regime in power has gone in full swing to nail him down in all possible ways. as an ordinary citizen of the country, may i propose the leader of the opposition, to offer him the presidency of the country if they come to power next time. hopefully, this shall bring glory both to the party and the country.

faces of facebook
one of the most revolutionary inventions of this decade has been facebook -- the enormously popular and addictive social website that has consumed the lives of so many. an interesting feature of facebook, founded by harvard dropout mark zuckerberg in 2004, is its ability to suck people into a virtual world of their illusionary selves recreated with glamorous photographs, racy video clips, and punchy self descriptions. facebook can thus easily transform the introvert into a flamboyant online persona!
throes of volatility

democracy and dogma in the middle east
there are many among us who, at the first mention of religion and politics, wiggle their forefingers and shake their heads and tell us that the two should never mix. religion is a matter of faith, they assert, and politics -- well, politics requires crafty calculations. religion is a matter of rules, but in politics, anything goes and everything's negotiable.
on the right side of history
forty years ago, the then eastern "wing: of pakistan was fighting for the same ideals people from countries in the middle east are fighting for today. the fight was for freedom -- the freedom to democratically choose their government, the right to hear their own voice and the desire to shape their destiny. like all great fights, the fight began in the hearts of ordinary people, eventually boiling over into the streets. just as those in east pakistan, facing genocide may have wondered why the world stood in silence and why no one came to their support, those in the middle east may be asking us the same questions today. throughout history, those with courage stood on the right side of history, while the silent majority opted for the easier option and watched with inaction. bangladeshis need to stand in support with the people of the middle east, especially given its own history from just 40 years ago. by standing with the people of the middle east, history will judge bangladeshis to be on the right side of history.
transcending the current conflicts in the microfinance sector in bangladesh
the backlash against microfinance
in spite of the great success of microfinance institutions (mfis) in bangladesh in providing financial access to over 20 million poor households, and that too through financially sustainable methodologies, the reaction here in bangladesh, very interestingly, has been extremely ambivalent. while many celebrate the global focus bangladesh receives in being one of the pioneering countries in promoting financial access, others, especially many policy makers and academics, see it as exploitative (through charging high interest rates and employing coercive repayment strategies) and ineffective (in improving client conditions and reducing poverty). in fact there has recently been a renewed spate of criticism, based often on flimsy evidence. this stems on the one hand from an over selling of microfinance by advocates, and on the other a failure of opponents to truly understand poor people and their financial lives coupled with a limited vision on how best to facilitate a democratisation of the financial sector.
