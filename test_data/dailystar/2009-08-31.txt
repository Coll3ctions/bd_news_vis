invitations farce?
in a political environment as in bangladesh, where politicians from opposite camps never see eye to eye, where the leaders of the two major parties never meet even by accident, where straightjacket mindset is the cause of the apparently unbreachable wall of mistrust between the two, many saw in the iftar invitations the possibilities of sheikh hasina and khaleda zia meeting; and which would have been a good opportunity for breaking the ice between the two. at the end what turned out was invitation farce. the two iftar parties were held in close proximity without either being represented in the other party.
