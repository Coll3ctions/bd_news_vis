cocktail blast case handling
immediately after the explosion in the chief justice's official residence compound on thursday night, home minister shahara khatun made what we believe to have been not only a premature, but also an utterly irresponsible remark. to a suggestion if she thought the attack was in anyway related to 'eviction' of the opposition leader from mainul hossain road residence, the minister apparently took the bait saying, "in that case, the attacker wouldn't escape punishment".
a planet circling a dying star
creation never ceases. and however much one would like to think that the birth and growth of the universe occurred at a particular point in time, that indeed the stars and the planets have taken a certain form and substance and have settled in their ordained places, there is yet a lot that keeps happening beyond the world we inhabit. news that a planet has been glimpsed on the outer rim of the milky way, one that appears to be orbiting a dying star, is one of those reports from outer space that keep rekindling our interest in what has regularly been happening along the cosmic patterns and through varied activities taking place all over the universe. view the page sports

balance of environment
as a green and a playground of beauties, bangladesh was once every coveted place for the tourists. they used to come here and be charmed by its colourful landscapes which was like a dream to them. numerous rivers, canals, marshy lands, boundless green fields and birds of different kinds are symbols of beauty as well as nature's way of balancing the environment. but irresponsible decisions of some ambitious people are destroying its beauty and environment. in the name of development they are constructing multi-storied buildings, markets and factories by earth-filling rivers, canals and ponds. many such projects in the capital, and indeed all over bangladesh, are going on without impediment. due to this the country is loosing croplands; as a result our food production is also decreasing by the day. loss of wetland is also causing unemployment to the fishermen. such harmful projects must be stopped forthwith, and the government should take immediate steps in this regard.
importance of overbridge
reluctance to use foot over bridge by the pedestrians is one of the important causes of road accidents. they cross the road in front of moving vehicles and consequently fall victims of fatal accidents. even then they are not keen to use the foot over bridge. there are many over bridges in dhaka city under the possession of hawkers and beggars. for example, we can mention the mouchak, newmarket, uttara azampur and mirpur foot over bridges.
