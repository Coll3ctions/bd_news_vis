prices sky-rocketing
it will not be an overstatement to say that the unchecked rise of prices of daily necessities has gone beyond the tolerance level of everyone, not to speak of the poor and the middle class consumers. the reasons remain inexplicable since no theory can satisfactorily explain the quantum leap in prices of essentials that is occurring on a daily basis. it proves right the thesis, which many economists put forward, that economic phenomenon taking place in bangladesh can seldom be explained by economic theories.

connected by an umbilical cord
if modernity is described as freeing man from tradition that would effectively mean wrenching human beings from the tranquility of communal life and bestowing upon him or her traits of individualism, then the question can be asked whether it would not mean alienation, in marxian term, and whether it is at all possible to acquire modernity as individuals are (barring exceptions) irretrievably connected with one another by family, social, national and international bonds.

tigers fail again
as usual the tigers went down meekly in the test series. once again our batsmen showed how untrained they are to play in the longer version of the game. almost all of them chased the balls outside the off stump; they stood still on the crease and regularly fished at the wide balls. there was absolutely no footwork, i think they need to improve a lot with their footwork. shot selection was also very poor. it seems they can't score runs in singles and couples which is inarguably the most vital thing to build up an innings. there is also a tendency among them to lose their patience after crossing the twenty mark as we've seen them throw their wickets away after reaching the mid twenties or thirties instead of going for a big score. i've also observed when the tigers go on defence they do nothing other than blocking the ball. thus the scoreboard comes to a halt, as a result pressure mounts on the batters. to ease things up they need to be more resourceful in defensive batting, they need to find the gaps and keep the scoreboard ticking steadily. we haven't forgotten that south africa is a very strong team consisting of many top ranking players. i think if the south african batsmen can score double hundreds ours should be able to score fifties if not hundreds.
migrant workers
a couple of news reports and writings on labour migration has drawn my attention. i am referring to the following two.

private university
they say bangladesh is a poverty stricken country. they say that nearly ninety percent of the population cannot have even two decent meals daily. now, there is a lot more to what they said, but let's concentrate on just a few for the moment. some say that basic education is the road to better life, which others agree to and decide to modify and say that basic education is the core of our business, and we will not let go any opportunity to earn the cash that will move us one step closer to being bill gates!!
ekushey and our progress
the blood-stained 21st february, now recognized as the international mother language day, is the recognition of all languages and cultures of the universe in order to preserve, celebrate and foster the world heritage, especially those on the verge of extinction due to the assault of the all enveloping western culture, branded as satellite culture.
solar power plant
i am rather disappointed to learn from a news report published in ds on february 11,2008 that the solar power plant installed by the power development board (pdb) at bagachola village under barkal upazila in rangamati at a cost of tk.8 lakh is virtually of no use because of lack of proper management. the report further said that about tk.4 lakh is being spent for salary of 29 staffs engaged for the maintenance of the solar projects.
a banker's job
looking into banking, one must first consider the advantages and the disadvantages of this particular career, and then decide whether the job will suit his or her individual needs. in general, a career in the banking industry seems extremely hard and very time consuming, and from time to time, has had me contemplating whether or not to major in finance. the type of work demanded is very diverse and seems very interesting, with very high compensation for individual performance. with that in mind, choosing to go into the banking industry could be very rewarding.
public university
i am proud to be a student of a public university. when i go home, my friends, relatives and others appreciate me. it was my dream to admit myself in a public university and i succeeded. but it is a university without a library, without quality education and without quality teachers. and there is no accommodation facility for the students. yes, it is our jagannath university.
education sector
the war on corruption that the government has been waging for over a year seems to have stalled. while some of the notorious political touts are in jail, elimination or reduction of corruption in some important public sectors is not apparent. for decades, the image of public universities has gone down because of corruption and irregularities in the administration.
