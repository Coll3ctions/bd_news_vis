train ride home . . .
i am thirteen years old, wearing a mid-length cotton flower dress of bright purple and blue, and matching strapped summer sandals and standing on the platform of kamalapur railway station in dacca. i will be a short distance passenger in an upcoming train. i am with my cousin waiting for the north-bound morning express train that will take us from dacca to ghorasal, our destination. i am going to be away for an entire month, for this is my summer vacation. i am going home. dacca is a transitory entity for me because there i attend an all girls' school, the very best at the time. the school's setting is ideal for learning, tucked away in a residential area with rows of shaal, piyal and krishnachura trees. i live with my eldest brother and his family farther down in a one-story big white house with a high black iron gate. the road across from the house is lined with kamini trees on both sides. most mornings i arrive at school with my brother in his office car, a white land rover. i feel happy going to school in a car. at school i occupy a double desk with the first girl and there i always have a novel on my lap. i read when the teacher isn't looking and often daydream and count the days to escape this city of smell, stench of human sweat and everything unfamiliar. i long for the smell of fresh country air and the sweet smell of my rose bush that i planted with my own tiny hands. in this city there is no sense of belonging. i would daydream of my vacation days so that i could escape to a place where the heart is. the last few days before school is over, i can hardly concentrate on schoolwork because in my mind i am already half way to the railway station. a week before my departure, my mid-size brown leather suitcase would be already packed and locked, filled with all the souvenirs and little gifts. i would gather or buy presents by saving from my monthly pocket money for my childhood girl friends who were eagerly waiting for my arrival as well.

a perspective on the tipaimukh issue . . .
nazmul alam, a retired senior bureaucrat, and m. abul kashem mozumder, professor and chair, department of public administration, jahangirnagar university, spell out their intent for writing tipaimukh and beyond in my paraphrased version: espousing conciliation, rather than confrontation, in crisis management, rejecting the notion of the construction of large dams because they might turn out to be economic, environmental and geopolitical liabilities, urging consultation, and still more consultation, for solving contentious issues like tipaimukh, and for doing away with the “rhetoric of mass meetings/utopian ideas of long march on any critical issues” because they are confrontational in nature and, consequently, inimical to the more rational device of consultation. granted that mao zedong's long march (1934-35) or, a little earlier, of mahatma gandhi's march to the sea to collect salt, were probably more suited to the era and in their particular contexts, one could also reasonably contend that, even in this age of information superhighway and communication revolution, mass protests might yield results that no amount of consultation would be able to. however, the authors' urging for resorting to continual discourse for coming to a viable and amicable solution over a complex problem is well taken.
