whither safety of the common man?
hardly had a day passed in the last several weeks without reports appearing in the media of incidents of people falling victims to attacks by criminals. the worrisome aspect is that these killings resulted from petty matters that should have been solved in a more urbane manner. only the other day two businessmen were killed because of disputes emerging out, ostensibly, of unfulfilled obligation of one party or the other. it seems that resorting to violence and killing have become the preferred arbiter of disputes.
local government autonomy
the chief election commissioner (cec) has talked about freeing the local government system from the direct influence of the members of parliaments (mps). we understand, the main objective behind the move is to allow the system to become autonomous so that it can run its own affairs with greater efficiency. in this regard, a fresh law has already been drafted by the government, which would empower a chairman of the upazila parishad to plan and carry out development activities, without looking upto the local mp. it may be mentioned here that earlier the commission on strengthening local government system had recommended for non-interference of the mps.

large-scale arrests are not helpful
in view of the large-scale arrests made by bangladesh police in recent times, it would be worthwhile to recollect that various constitutional rights in the nature of human rights of individual suspects come under the direct handling of police in all stages of crime investigation -- from arrest to imprisonment. in a country like bangladesh, where stricter penal laws have to be enacted to curb the terrorist menace and other criminal mischief -- to be enforced by the police not trained to a necessary level -- there is always likelihood of abuse of powers by the police in negation of the individual's rights.
can't we check the decline of dhaka city?
ill-conceived policies of the past that still continue have created nightmarish conditions in our cities. worst affected is the dhaka city that grapples with oversized population, scanty land space compared to heavy exodus from rural outbacks, noxious emissions and toxic effluents from big and small factories coupled with recurrent thrust of natural disasters like flood, and storms. compounding the crisis resulting from the deterioration of physical environment is the unceasing wave of terrorism, violence and crime committed in the streets even in broad day light because of lax governance and weak policing.
achieving food security and becoming food surplus
dedicated planning and timely supports can make bangladesh food-surplus and ensure food security for its population. this year's net food grain shortage is only 0.1 mil. ton against a total demand of 26 mil. tons (despite 1.8 mil. tons standing crops damage by back-to-back floods and sidr). bangladesh produced 24.3 mil. tons of food grains in 1999-2000 matching the requirements of the then 130 mil. population and since then it is on the fringe of self-sufficiency. presently, bangladesh has 8.29 mil. ha. of cultivable land and about 145.6 mil. population. each year, the country is loosing about 1 percent of its cultivable lands to non-agricultural uses while its popualtion is increasing by about 2 mil. a yearly incremental production of 0.35 mil. ton in addition to 2 mil. tons average deficit is required for food grains self-sufficiency. view the page urban

the fni militias operated from their hideouts at datule, located north of kafe. the militias were causing so much of tension and difficulties for the bangladeshi camps as well as for the hema refugees that they had to be stopped. a raid on the fni camp at datule was ordered from the sector hq at bunia. bangladeshi troops carried out the operations on the fni camps and could capture about thirty militias with their weapons and ammunitions. however, most of the militia, about four hundred of them, could escape with their arsenals. they took shelter in the hill of ndriki, further north.

economic diplomacy as a strategy of foreign policy

the operation, codenamed “azada wosa” or “be free”
the operation, codenamed “azada wosa” or “be free” in pashtun, has great tactical importance for the occupation forces. the 2,300 troops of the 24th marine expeditionary unit, which only arrived in afghanistan seven weeks ago to reinforce the nato-commanded international security assistance force (isaf), were hurled last week into a major assault on insurgent strongholds near the town of garmser in helmand province. the guerillas in that area are mostly supporters of the taliban islamic fundamentalist movement, which was overthrown by the 2001 us invasion.
the myth of 'wea pons of peace'
celebrations attending the tenth anniversary of pokhran ii were unsurprisingly muted. this projected india as a responsible nuclear power, while having internal political utility of denying credit to the current opposition party for tests conducted in its earlier tenure at the helm. the commentary attending the anniversary, however, has generally been along two lines. the first is on how nuclearization has contributed to india's security while the second is on how india is lagging behind in relation to its adversaries. along the latter direction, there is even motivated talk of a 'missile gap' opening up with pakistan!

greatness put through a twister?
how do you define greatness? and exactly how many fields can a study of greatness cover? the answers to these questions will likely be as intricate as the queries themselves. but when media organisations such as the bengali service of the british broadcasting service undertake a programme to assess the contributions of bengali men and women and so arrive at an understanding of what greatness is all about, the effort should be considered rather encouraging. on second thought, however, history is never a matter of individuals coming by popular acclaim. and greatness is not to be assessed through the opinions of radio listeners, for the chances are that a very large number of these listeners are too close to their times to be able to focus on events of the past. and so they are quite likely to miss out on some significant cogs in the wheels of moving time.

travels down the pathways of the soul
the prophet is a novella the reader can complete reading within a short span of time. it is comprised of 115 pages only. and yet the wisdom and the insights that the reader gains from this book can seldom be achieved in a whole lifetime. kahlil gibran was born in lebanon and was a poet, philosopher and an artist. the book, a spiritual reincarnation with twenty-six poetic essays, is a pure treasure grove. the reader only has dig into it to come out feeling that he or she has found the ultimate light of life. it is a book that grips your soul from the first page to the last and shakes your senses awake.
mundane thoughts prattled out
maybe the line of beauty is not an appropriate title for this book. maybe 'the line of ennui' would make a better substitute. there isn't one aspect of the book which can be discussed, enviously, and yet it's the 2004 man booker prize winner the deceptive praise that lures readers into the trap of purchasing this book.
