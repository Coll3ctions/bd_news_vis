stop turag encroachers
the grabbers have become desperate in their ravenous greed to take hold of as much of the land as possible from the different rivers surrounding the capital city. it has again become glaringly evident from the way they have given a damn about the high court (hc) verdict of june 24 last as well as government warnings to that effect against encroachments on the rivers surrounding the capital city.
commandeering land in sitakunda
it makes disconcerting reading because the incident militates against values and the social principles we have always held dear. news reports relating to what the son of a ruling party lawmaker has been doing in sitakunda --- he and his associates have simply laid claim to land belonging to four ship-breaking yards along the coast --- are once more proof of the impunity with which the powerful disregard the law. as if recent reports of intimidation and grabbing of property in various parts of the country were not enough, this latest incident of a commandeering of land can only push us again into asking questions neither we nor anyone else can be comfortable with. suffice it to say for now that what the lawmaker's child has done is a clear and unabashed violation of not only the law but of moral principles as well.

shakib al hasan, the world-beater
having been inexplicably ignored at the icc cricket awards last week, the smile returned to shakib al hasan's lips yesterday as the bangladesh all-rounder was named by respected cricket monthly the wisden cricketer - - as the best test player of the year.
the truth will out
when shakib al hasan was announced as wisden cricket magazine's test player of the year, yours truly made a mental note not to label this a 'richly deserved honour'. however, without that phrase you would find yourself strangely speechless. less than a week ago, an article in these pages discussed that it was a damned shame that shakib was not awarded the international player of the year award along with the odi player of the year accolade at the international cricket council (icc) cricket awards 2009. now however, we can celebrate possibly his greatest achievement yet. the truth of the matter is that the icc is an organisation that may be the governing body of world cricket, yet the people who run it and those who select the awards all have their own agendas. people outside the confines of their dubai offices have just as much talent, intellect and cricketing knowledge and as such their agendas are not entirely commercial. thinking freely without the fear of lalit modi and the colonial cricket boards, the most reputed cricket magazine in the world proved to a global audience once again that the truth will out.

swine flu vaccine
american authorities are much concerned about the possible outbreak of swine flu in the coming winter. the assuring news is that a vaccine for swine flu is almost ready for inoculation. a number of pharmaceutical companies are working on swine flu vaccine. the us food and drug administration has given novaritis and sanofi-aventis the green signal to start producing their vaccine strains. the centres for disease control and prevention (cdc) has also prepared guidelines indicating five key populations that should be vaccinated against the swine flu (h1n1) virus. but doubts have also been generated concerning the side effects of the swine flu vaccine. some in-line experts have expressed fear that the vaccine might weaken the receiver's immune system and even cause brain damage. as medical case history reveals, in 1976, nearly 40 million people were inoculated with then produced swine flu vaccine but the side effects were of high magnitude which claimed a number of lives and caused huge damage to those who got inoculated. the us government had to pay millions of dollars in liability claims. true, the present vaccine has been said to be safe and with less side effects. let's hope for the best result.
daytime saving
in mid july, this year, our usual time was advanced by an hour on the plea of availing daylight to complete day's routine work in govt. offices and in various organisations. how funny is the suggestion for our country, where, even in winter days, we have plenty of daylight ! electricity is not only consumed for light but there are fans, air conditioning and many other electrical gadgets! electricity is consumed not only in offices and workplaces, but there are millions of private residential houses, and round the clock functioning industries !
decentralise governance
it is easier to solve dhaka's multifarious problems by switching the current political philosophy or approach to the mode of governance of overcrowded bangladesh (density of population is one of the highest in the world: nearing 1,000 persons per sq km).
low-grade teachers
it has been reported that a probe body headed by a former justice has been formed to look into the irregularities in the appointment of teachers and officials in the public universities during the period of previous bnp-jamaat led government. the quality of university education in bangladesh has gone down which has been revealed in a recent international survey on world university ranking. bangladesh universities are far behind others. this is because of the appointment of low-grade teachers in public universities. induction of substandard teachers started mainly in the 1980s and it gained momentum in the disguise of so called democratic governance after 1990. both the bnp and the awami league governments have tarnished the image of university by appointing a huge number of low-grade teachers. so only a probe into the bnp-jamaat led government will not bring credit to the government. for the sake of quality education in public universities, all irregularities during both the regimes should be probed.
load shedding and exams
almost two months ago, i appeared in exams in a renowned public college of chittagong under the national university. just then, i faced a bizarre situation. first and foremost, the awful atmosphere of the exam hall. though hundreds of candidates were taking the exams, there was no special arrangement for instant power supply. as a result, frequent power outages made the hall atmosphere intolerably hot. furthermore, the exams were taken in a room without good natural light. secondly, the invigilators did not seem to be dutiful. they did not appear to be helpful either.
directive misunderstood!
yesterday the pm asked the communications minister to ease the traffic jam in dhaka city. the pm sent this instruction from the dhanmondi al office. this (5 oct) morning i could not come to school on time due to a huge new traffic jam on mirpur road because traffic police blocked/fenced the road # 6 yesterday (as a result there was no movement of vehicles between west - east - west. i think without knowing the consequences, the traffic police took this action.
gross error
i went through my grand daughter's textbook "social studies and bangladesh." in page 6 of the above book, part-iii while defining the oceans it is stated that the indian ocean surrounds the north pole and like the north pole it is always frozen throughout the year. the book was first published in september, 2001 and the fourth reprint was in july 2006. if i assume it is a printing error, question arises why was it not corrected in subsequent reprints?
action, not assurance
while addressing a gathering of expatriate bangladeshis in new york recently, prime minister sheikh hasina assured the countrymen saying that her government would not do anything that harms the interest of the country. it is understood that a democratically elected government in all circumstances is oath bound to safeguard its country's interests.
pm's us trip
the year 1601 chronicles the birth of the lofty “buland darwaja” to commemorate the conquest of gujarat by the great akbar. no - it was no fun-filled trip flanked by a dear sister or spearheaded by an expatriate it-expert son. yes, he had his minions, but he knew their exact nature. the trip was incarnadine with real jostling and he really did own. thus this majestic sandstone gate stands for something real.
gandhi, palestine and peace
while responding to ashikur rahman's letter on "mahatma gandhi" mahmood elahi from ottawa writes in ds (5th oct):
ogpc's objectives
recently we see with sorrow that, the leftists of bangladesh have shifted from their position to nationalism which indicates that they are also affected by the globalisation or they couldn't escape the effect of globalisation. they are now trying to protect the interest of the neighbouring countries behind the banner of the oil, gas protection committee subconsciously. opposing the model psc doesn't mean the cancellation of the psc. the ogpc is presenting false information to the people about the 80% export option and trying to hide the impossibility of the export option. so far we know the govt., for the first time, brought the energy company under the tax net by imposing 40% corporate tax.
undue pomp
austerity is of prime importance for this country at the moment, and a little care would lead us to a stronger and better economy. unfortunately, the intellectuals in the talk shows on television have never spoken about this (i am not sure as i might have missed some).
no more cash for biman
our corrupt national airline , bangladesh biman, is asking for guarantee from the government so that banks will start lending it money for buying new aircrafts (ds, october 4). what it all means is that biman will not repay a single penny of the loans and in the end our poor people will have to foot the bill of hundreds of millions of dollars.
dismal failure
i do not know how to define the apathy and attitude of the cabinet ministers with exception of only a few. the energy state minister has no clue or idea about the concept, merits and demerits of the dst. he has said that it is running well, why do we need to put back the clock? he seemed to be talking about the closing hours of shops and big business centre, which might have saved some energy. surprisingly, nobody, nobody in the government has yet produced any concrete and scientific results of energy saving by the dst. either they do not have any technical capacity to measure the same or they are happy with the earlier closer of the shops.
