rivers and regional cooperation
regional water sharing and management are today a critical factor in relations between and among states. and nowhere is it more pronounced than in south asia, where the problem of a sharing of common rivers has often undermined the prospects of bilateral as well as multilateral cooperation. in turn, this absence of cooperation has led to bitterness or mistrust at the political level, to a point where bilateral ties have remained static. but such conditions are today in clear need of reversal owing specifically to the newer and bigger issues thrown up by climate change. the emphasis that has been placed on the global environment in the past decade, if not more, now serves as a warning that unless the spirit of regional cooperation comes into play everywhere and especially in south asia, it will be the common future of the peoples of the various countries involved that will suffer.

traffic jam
let us have a look at the main causes of traffic jam at a glance:
depressing news
i have to brace myself before opening newspapers or turning on the television or radio, knowing very well that disappointing news is waiting there. in the november 4, 2010 issue of the daily star, there is quite a number of such news. road crashes kill 9, 60 hurt in cop-student clash in city, bsf kills 1, man kills wife in city, ju journo assaulted by bcl men, agitators besiege brta office, abductors kill 4-year-old boy, muggers stab trader to death. the situation is worsening day by day, and there is no improvement. to tackle the situation law-enforcing agents must fan out all over the country and remain vigil all the time. criminals must get exemplary punishment, in no circumstances should they be allowed to get away.
predatory lendings
as the obama administration rejects a foreclosure moratorium and austerity protests grip europe, nobel prize-winning economist joseph stiglitz backs calls for a foreclosure moratorium and says opponents of a new government stimulus "don't understand basic economics."
writer and the altruistic politician
in her recent remarks, noted indian writer arundhati roy stated, "i pity a nation that needs to jail those who ask for justice." her statement is in particular challenging the recent outcry of some politicians who demand that she must be brought to justice for sedition.
plastered with signboards
once upon a time, dhaka was known as the city of mosques. now it can well be known as the “city of signboards”. they come in all shapes and sizes, black 'n white/coloured, as banners, leaflets, stencils and huge hoardings, costing from a couple of takas to elaborate affairs costing lacs with their own lighting/scaffolding. they do not bother if they are a eye-sore, obstruct view and traffic or a nuisance for those who wish to keep their walls etc clean. who is there to protest/protect?
community e-centre
with the help of community e-centre the door of information technology will be open for marginalized and hard to reach area's people. the govt. has taken it as a challenge, which is a part of digitalisation of bangladesh. of late, the planning commission took a project of tk. 598 crore to fulfil the dream of digital bangladesh.
road built for self destruction
road no. 8 in gulshan 1, for about 100 meters for the main avenue towards the best was badly damaged. recently gulshan municipality had it rebuilt. the top layer was of 2 to 30 inch thick concrete. the concreting was done throughout the day on 30th october. however, no arrangements were made to cure the concrete, and the concrete cast, was not kept wet. without curing the concrete road surface will crumble within the next few months.
good leaders
according to promoth chowdhury, a renowned writer of the bengali literature, “reading book is one of the best habits of human beings." i am sure people around the world who love to read books would agree with the statement.
childcare homes
we are working parents. my wife is a teacher of a school run by an ngo for the underprivileged children. i am a teacher of a private university. my university is not very far from my house, but i have to start very early in the morning because of traffic jam. no body is there to take care of my 6-year-old daughter tahiti when we are not in home. a governess stays with my daughter after she returns from her school. but she cannot manage to come every day.
an appeal
a good number of students of monipur high school go to attend their classes from ahmad nagar, east monipur and janata housing of mirpur, using a connecting road at popular housing-1, barabagh. at the entrance of this road there is a welding shop. in the welding shop most of the workers are young and they do their works in the middle of the road creating a barricade to the passengers. they even tease the school going girls.
a new trend
we all know from our daily experiences that the public buses plying on different routes of dhaka city are not enough for carrying all the commuters. a new trend has developed among the bus drivers. during office time all local buses declare themselves as sitting service buses and raise the fare. the helplessness of the people at that time is beyond description.
