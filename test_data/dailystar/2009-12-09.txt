copenhagen conference is an opportunity
the sense of urgency which characterises the world climate conference in copenhagen says it all. never before has the international community been exposed to the kind of risks it now faces because of the increasing deterioration in global climate conditions. on the first day of the conference, where as many as 192 nations are taking part and which will be joined later by heads of government and state, these risks were highlighted. perhaps yvo de boers, the un climate chief, put it in perspective when he noted that the time for formal statements is over, that indeed the moment is here and now for governments across the world to take concrete action. a major component of such action must be a deal that will have the world's rich and emerging economies promise to curb their greenhouse gas emissions.

wind and solar power
i am writing with reference to the piece "nuclear generator" by engineer shafi ahmed (dec. 1).
launch disasters
i refer to various letters, articles, comments etc., on this tragic matter from home and abroad. this and practically all other ills of our hapless society can be traced to the relentless force of 'population pressure' on our resources and psyche. in our country human life seems to the cheapest commodity and this accords with the laws of economics that the value of any commodity is dependent on its 'relative scarcity'. successive governments in bangladesh have failed to curb the explosion of population as a priority, often misguidedly believing that a large population is a source of economic strength. so people are what we now have in utmost abundance on every square foot of soil or water surface of bangladesh, and that is why according to the economic principle it is now the cheapest commodity. it is no wonder people are dying on the roads, the rivers, of malnutrition and ill health, and as victims of criminal gangs, unbridled corruption, extortion, etc.
the mangrove forests
the sundarbans is one of the most beautiful and largest mangrove forests in bangladesh and it is the largest remaining tract of mangrove forests in the world. the forest covers 10,000km of which about 6,000 are in bangladesh. it became inscribed as a unesco world heritage site in 1997. royal bengal tiger as well as numerous fauna including different species of birds, spotted deer, crocodiles and snakes etc are found here. but the bad news is that the sundarbans has a population of over 4 million and they are spoiling its beauty. the population pressure resulted in half of this eco-region's mangrove forests cut down to supply the fuel wood. other natural resources are also extracted from these forests by this large population. the sundarbans play an important role in the economy of the south-western region of bangladesh as well as in the national economy. now it is contesting to be a part of the seven wonders of the world.
between chaos and confusion!
failure of the traffic light based automated system of traffic management was reported in the front page of most dailies on november 23. this is nothing but the natural result of most drivers' normal response to usual traffic management system, where hand signals by traffic policemen supersedes traffic lights! drivers are used to manual traffic control, so even with the red light they will go on driving! they naturally wait for the whistle and hand signal before stopping! this is what they have been used to at all times.
mugging on the rise
a mugging story on a busy road of the dhaka city is basically a glaring evidence of poor law and order situation in our country, especially in dhaka.
climate change and we
one of the uk's best known scientists, professor james lovelock, says only a catastrophe will prompt the world to tackle the threat of climate change seriously. he also said: in late 1930 when i was a student we knew that war was imminent, but there was no clear idea of what to do about it. we think that something unpleasant may soon happen but we are as confused over what to do about it as we were in 1938. our response so far is just an attempt to appease.
rich are always right
i am not at all religious, but even i was flabbergasted seeing the distorted mentality of people. the other day i was coming back home from dhanmondi when i saw a bus sporting a nice advertisement on its back. the advertisement informed consumers about the chance to get a free butcher for the upcoming eid if they answered a very clever question.
cox's bazar
we can and we build the mega sea beach from cox's bazar to teknaf as asia's greatest tourist attraction. if tajmahal is asia's most beautiful monument and people from all over the world flock to agra, why does the most panoramic and longest sea beach of cox's bazar of bangladesh fail to quench the thirst of the people all over the globe?
corporate governance
corporate governance has become a buzzword in the corporate world, especially when the latest global financial crisis originated in the u.s.a. due to poor governance of financial institutions. therefore, recently corporate governance which replicates a mechanism to mitigate the conflict of interests among the stakeholders of a corporation, has also received increased attention from our regulatory bodies.
historic verdict
after the historic supreme court verdict on the killing of sheikh mujib many people have claimed that it's a glorious triumph of the rule of law in bangladesh. however, we must not forget that this verdict was made possible because its facilitation was one of the foremost priorities of the ruling party. the family members of the incumbent prime minister were the direct victims of the brutal massacre of 1975. obviously, no one can possibly condone the killers of his/her family members and as the most powerful person of the nation she was firmly determined to bring the killers to justice.
poisoning of the pm?
well, in the careless utterances (or mutterings) of many of our great leaders vagaries abound. i would have given the whole episode a rather farcical pass. but the fact that the question was raised by the personal physician (i suppose he is competent and more of a doctor than a politician) of a sitting pm, it becomes an issue of national importance and of national security. this needs to be delved further, and if true, proper medical and legal intervention is in order.
gender equality
women have basically achieved parity in participation in most areas of undergraduate and coursework postgraduate study. however, there are still some areas such as engineering and architecture where women are under represented. again, there are fewer women these days undertaking post graduate study. this is partly due to financial restraints and less funding options to undertake this level of study. we feel more emphasis is required to make all careers at all levels of education more accessible to women. girls in general have excellent completion rates and results at junior and senior high school level. view the page international
