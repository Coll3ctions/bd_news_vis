so, the awami league killed bangabandhu?
the acting secretary general of the bangladesh nationalist party has of late been giving us much food for thought. a few days ago, when he and his party should have come forth with a clear, outright condemnation of the recent attempt to remove the awami league-led government through one more murderous coup d' etat, he remained charmingly vague about what position the bnp had on the issue. now, that would be all right for a lot of people. but then, do not forget that there are all those cynics spread all over the place. and they will not soon forget the demand made by the bnp some weeks ago for a disbanding of the international crimes tribunal now busy trying to bring the war criminals of 1971 to justice. that was a wrong, almost suicidal move for the party. here you have a party which says nothing about the three million who died in the war of liberation, of the intellectuals led away to a gory end by the death squads of the jamaat-e-islami on the eve of victory, but which comes out strongly in defence of the very men who were part of that murder machine along with the pakistan army forty years ago.
the art of the jostle
which of the two is more difficult to deal with in the political style of south asia: affection or anger? in physical terms, the first. the principal motif of any display of popular support is the jostle. whether it is yousaf gilani on his way to the supreme court in islamabad, or mulayam singh yadav scrambling towards the legislature in lucknow, supporters feel entitled to test the body warmth of their leader by getting as close to him as possible.

china-bangladesh relations: contemporary convergence
the relationship between bangladesh and china dates back centuries. historical records show that there were three silk roads that connected primeval china with the indian aubcontinent. the southern silk route was a bridge between the eastern part of bengal (today's bangladesh) and the middle kingdom. war and other conflicts in the region, particularly during and after world war ii, disrupted the sino-bengal historical ties and connectivity.
samson chowdhury: icon of a non-marxian capitalist
samson chowdhury lived an enviable life. he died an enviable death: a glorious one indeed, at the mature age of 86. he left behind his wife, children and grand-children besides thousands of friends and well-wishers to mourn his death. he was a venerable man, a half-legend in his lifetime, morphed into a full legend after his death. a favourite icon of his time he carried all before him by his presence, drive and elegance. it seems death has imparted additional lustre to his living self. paying homage to him is a pleasure, we all enjoy it.
