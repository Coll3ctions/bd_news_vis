what of the photograph made out of nothing? what about painting with light? is it photography? surely if we can paint with light we can paint with dreams, create the morning mist or the afternoon glow. is it fake? hardly. whatever else may be false in this tenuous existence of ours, imagination is not. all that we value, that we strive to uphold, all that gives us strength, has been made of dreams, and we must dream on. if pixels be the vehicle that realises our dreams, be it so.
