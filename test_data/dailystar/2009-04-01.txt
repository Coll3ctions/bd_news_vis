textbook crisis
every year we face a textbook crisis. students do not get new books on time due to an artificial crisis. i would put forward a suggestion which may solve the problem. introducing online version of books alongside the traditional textbooks can be a good idea. internet is now a very powerful means of communication. during the ssc and hsc results, we saw a large number of students in front of computer. the number of the users of internet is increasing gradually. certainly a section of students and guardians will be benefited and it will also reduce the huge demand of textbooks at the beginning of a new session. besides there will hardly be any mistakes in online versions of books, as any kinds of inclusion and deletion of the texts can be done quickly, which is not possible in the printed textbooks.

replace plastic bottles
in recent years plastic bottles are being extensively used as container for drinking water, edible oils and beverages. water stored in plastic bottles risks becoming contaminated from plastic by-products, like bisphenol. a (bpa) and phthalate. as these substances leach from the plastic, the water and beverage remain no longer safe. glass doesn't have this problem. it is a fact that (bpa), a common plastic binder found in many polycarbonate bottles, is making its way into our bodies. seven hundred studies have been conducted regarding the ill effects pf bpa. the containers that it is found in are made of hard, clear polycarbonate plastic. the highest risk group is babies because their bodies are developing and their cells are being programmed. this programming that a baby's body undergoes is a very sensitive process. this is why it is advisable to switch to plastic baby bottles without bpa in them or use glass baby bottles. studies show that exposure to low levels of bpa during pregnancy, infancy and early childhood may affect normal development and "sensitivity to onset of disease later in life, most particularly the potential for mammary and prostate cancer."
economic recession
world economic recession is now knocking at our door. as bangladesh is not an isolated island, so it is obvious that recession will hit us. this is just like a financial sidr. albeit its effect in short term is not visible but in the long run it will affect us very seriously. already remittance has gone down and migrant workers are coming back. many us and uk citizens of bangladesh origin have already lost their jobs. export of our rmg is going down and obviously export orders have also decreased. none can say how long this situation will linger. the policy makers of bangladesh should contemplate the likely scenario.
