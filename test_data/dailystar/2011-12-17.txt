mainamati
my imagination runs away the moment i enter the immaculately restored shalban bihar in mainamati. this was once a self-contained buddhist monastery where, a thousand years ago, monks lived, studied and prayed. its square shape - sides measuring 169 metres - was surrounded by a wall 3 metres thick with only one entrance. the monks lived in 115 tiny rooms laid out along the square's edges; they prayed at a central temple. standing on top of the temple's remains, i could see all these and more.

go for real democratic values
sworn democrats have cogent reasons to worry under the prevailing socio-political circumstances wherein mainstream politicians are not on talking terms, not to speak of engaging in meaningful dialogue to resolve contentious issues. while such issues are more than one, we are witnessing increasingly vituperative deliberations from partisan platform. the innuendos and the clearly disparaging remarks do not bode well for our fledgling democracy.
a fresh poll needed
there is not a shred of doubt that the manmohan singh government would have fallen last week if it had persisted in going ahead with foreign direct investment (fdi) in retail. the opposition came together and the government was reduced to 206 in the 545-member house. a similar fate can confront the government if it does not improve upon the diluted bill to set up the institution of ombudsman (lokpal) to deal with corruption. once they span their differences, the government can face the same situation as it did on fdi. behind-the-scenes efforts have not stopped to bring down the government. permutations and combinations are being worked out and it looks difficult for the government to last the full term up to may, 2014. the threat has already affected the functioning of government. decisions are taking long time and there is a paralysis in the administration. it looks as if it is the momentum which is keeping it going.

climate finance: the gordian knot in the puzzle
climate finance is the most crucial issue in the climate negotiations. the basic principles of climate finance, such as `new and additional,' `adequate,' `predictable,' etc. are agreed upon by the parties. but these principles are far from being operational. basically, there are three aspects to this issue: a) supply side, b) demand side and c) governance of finance, which combines the two.
act locally and push globally
bangladesh which has been made of billions of tons alluvial soil from himalaya on indo-gangetic lowland is now faced with the fallout from climate change and natural disasters induced from it. the gravity of the problem is so high that it calls for action from our part in a synchronised way without any more dillydallying. with our disaster prone geography coupled with low economic strength, inadequate infrastructure, low level of social development, lack of institutional capacity, and higher dependency on natural resource base, we are increasingly being left at the mercy of nature. view the page literature

bread and jam
doe, a deer, a female deer/ ray, a drop of golden sun/… / tea, a drink with jam and breada very old time favourite song of our childhood from the most popular julie andrews movie the sound of music. as old a time as when we used to play on the street in quiet afternoons where the only sound was the chirping of children which would soon be followed by birds and finally by the tranquillity of the end of any ordinary day. ti (tea) is the seventh note of an octave which is used as a drink in the song for the children to make them familiar with the most common form of breakfast food around the world. but truly bread and jam have different meanings. for most people in the world jam is a spread to have on toasted or not-toasted bread, rolls, cakes, etc. to cater for every craving tongue it is made of all exotic fruits like strawberry, cherry, plum, even from carrots. jam can also mean congestion or blockages of substances. similarly, bread is a phrase that is very widely used in english to mean earning for living, not just a mere food item. even in bengali we refer to the same idea as 'rooti-rooji' to mean bread winning or bread earning, that is, means of subsistence. like breakfast mix 'bread and jam' for the world it is an inseparable mix for lives in dhaka.

recalibrating bangladesh-myanmar relation
the relation between bangladesh and myanmar officially began on january 13, 1972, the date on which myanmar recognised bangladesh as a sovereign state. however, the relation between these two close neighbours has never been smooth and has undergone frequent ups and downs over the last 40 years on a few issues. both countries have not been able to build a pragmatic relationship with each other despite having a lot of potentials. myanmar being closed to the outside world for more than 50 years shows few distinct patterns of behaviour in developing effective bilateral relations with bangladesh. these are: myanmar capitalised bangladesh's geographical vulnerability, being remained under the umbrella of china was reluctant to count her small neighbour, being always stubborn in their attitude and behavior to solve the disputes and more inclined towards india and china. as such bangladesh was discouraged and lost interest to charter a course to bring myanmar into a negotiation table for developing meaningful relation with her. on the contrary, india and china have taken the full advantage of myanmar's isolation and developed a deep relationship with her.
indo-gulf cooperation: an option or a must?
it is a fact: india's booming economy and population will result in a substantial increase in its needs in terms of energy resources and global partners. many countries around the globe are recognising india's rising power and are working to strengthen their economic, political and social ties with her. partnering with india has been increasingly getting presence in the agendas of many arab states especially the gulf countries, but not as a priority. in spite of this increasing awareness of the importance of india as a strong future ally and partner, arab states are still not fully engaging india through building strong and reliable relations especially on the front of public diplomacy. the current efforts mainly revolve around trying to agree on and sign bilateral trade and energy agreements. diplomacy between the gulf countries and india has remained at the government to government level, not really reaching the public.

spraying life with charm
professor abdullah abu sayeed needs no introduction. while most young people may know him as an academician and founder of a wonderful institution, bishwa sahitya kendra, some of them also know how popular a tv host he was. and they know that because their elders have told them how they used to remain glued to their television sets to see abdullah abu sayeed's programmes in the 1960s and 1970s. this book of his ---amar uposthapak jibon---is a story of those magical days of his life as a television presenter.
the cure for dandruff
a woman without a man, says gloria steinem, is like a fish without a bicycle. that sounds rather strange, even bizarre, until you realise the wit in that statement. and wit is something we have been doing without, much to our surprise, for quite a while now. when was the last time you heard someone among the glamorous and the glitzy come up with a wisecrack? there is ronald reagan, with his 'honey, i forgot to duck' comment to his wife moments after the assassination attempt on him in march 1981. there was john f. kennedy, who regaled newsmen on his visit to france in 1961 with the remark, 'gentlemen, i am the man who accompanied jacqueline kennedy to paris.' rack your brains and you just might recover some of the gems of humour you may have lost over the years.
crisp prose laced with subtle wit
when the man booker prize for literature for 2011 was finally announced and the earlier short listed name of english novelist and short story writer julian barnes was flashed on tv screens and computer monitors through the internet, i wasn't quite surprised. julian barnes is, no doubt, one of the most distinguished writers of the present-day world, and his works have already been translated into nearly thirty languages, although bengali, unfortunately. doesn't appear to be one of those.
