plight of rice growers
the harvest of boro paddy is under way in the country with expectations of bumper production of about 2 crore tons. in estimations by different agencies, it has been shown that the cost of production of per kg rice would be tk 12-13 . but the price of rice in the local market is about tk 400 per 40 kg. so, the govt. has fixed the price at tk 14 per kg of un-husked rice and tk 22 per kg of husked rice to give the farmers a better price. the govt. has also set the target to buy 12 lakh tons of rice from the local market during this season. now the question is what impact it will have, while the farmers will have to sell a major portion of rice in the market.
swine flu
the health ministry has made a timely move to prevent the deadly swine flu now sweeping across the us and mexico from entering bangladesh. similar measures were taken earlier too when epidemic such as bird flu was threatening this part of the world. however, that threat passed over with no cases reported in bangladesh.
politics and public interest
i would like to draw the attention of the government and the media to two very urgent and important issues of public interest. one is related to primary farmers and the second one to swine flu. during the last two days we watched some disturbing protests of the farmers, though non violent but very far reaching impact bearing. farmers were seen with placards for full price of procurement of rice and paddy and asking for farm gate procurement from the growers, eliminating the middlemen. they also protested against the import policy of the government on powder milk, which has eventually affected the prices of home grown milk by the processing companies.
population boom
in our country, about 1,100 people live in each square kilometre. the population is at present more than one hundred and fifty million. it is growing rapidly. this alarming growth of population is leading bangladesh to endless miseries and sufferings. to face this dreadful situation, different measures have already been adopted. but practically no tangible result has been achieved. in order to get rid of this situation:
english medium schools
on may 1 bbc aired a programme focusing on the english medium schools. the programme shows that there is no particular curriculum for the existing english medium schools in our country. the principal in every school is all in all. the principal selects the syllabus for the students of his /her school. so, the students in different schools learn different things. there is another concern that in some schools the authorities teach geography of europe, instead of bangladesh.
tagore's birth anniversary
rabindranath tagore's 148th birth anniversary is being celebrated with full fervour in bangladesh, west bengal and other places abroad where the bengali diaspora now extends. there will be a lot of justifiable encomia and tributes for this great poet and personage of bengal. i would like to say a few words about why i think that after gitajanli and the nobel prize (1913), by the 1920s there was a distinct cooling off regarding tagore in english literary circles.
commonwealth
once the sun did not set in the vast british empire. not only our sub-continent, the present superpower mighty america was also under british rule. they directly conquered many countries, they would enter in the guise of traders or preachers but at last they became the emperors of those countries. but as nobody can hold power forever, the british lost their supreme power and thus many independent countries were born .
traffic jams
nowadays, there is nobody in dhaka city who isn't a victim of traffic jam. we, the common people of dhaka, are frustrated with this evil thing. it is difficult to avoid traffic jams. but we don't know why the law enforcers cannot enforce the traffic rules in the street. as a resident of dhanmondi area, we are unfortunately familiar with illegal parking beside the roads & footpaths. though dhanmondi has wide lanes, parked cars make the lanes narrow. even we don't have any space in the footpaths as these are used as the parking space. continuous blaring of automobile horns is putting pressure on our nerves.
fire fighters' safety
i watched with horror as i saw fire fighters fighting to douse the fire at mohakhali petrol pump on may 04. i was equally shocked a few days ago to see the fire fighters fighting to put off the blazes at bashundhara shopping mall.
real victims
although the blazing sun and the scorching heat are the recent hot topic as they have broken the records of 14 years. simultaneously, the lack of adequate water and the frequent power supply cuts have aggravated the whole situation, bringing more turmoil to the life of people. but still we forget about the real victims, rickshaw-pullers as they suffer in every season. many have no house and so live on footpaths and a large number of people are found in the slums. not only in the hot season, they are affected in rainy season also as they bathe in rainwater and the wind of winter freezes them, as they have no warm clothes to face the situation. still they fight many storms and other natural disasters and the very next day they get to work as they live hand to mouth. they rickshaw-pullers lead a simple life. of course festivals like eid, pahela baishakh etc are nothing special for them as they have to ferry people to different amusement parks and other places.
test of strength?
some bengali newspapers have carried out a news item under the headline "aaj awami league o bnp er shakti parikkha", meaning "today there will a test of strength between the awami league and the bnp".
a suggestion
hundred days of honeymoon is over. the government of sheikh hasina has passed the acid test of bdr carnage. due to better management and worldwide price fall essentials have become cheaper, a bumper boro production will ease the situation even more. load management of power proved beneficial to irrigation. with welcome rain life has also returned to some normalcy. these are all good signs of better governance. but there are definitely some sore points which need to be addressed in no time. law and order is one such sector where the police and other law enforcing agencies seem to be moving without a sense of direction. the administration is infested with the past government's people who are out to foil the good endeavours of the government. political, youth and student activists of the ruling party are in total disarray, searching for proper direction.
govt and power generation
to express his keenness on his schemes for electrification, lenin, the russian leader used to say that “electricity plus soviets equal socialism” and to materialize his thinking, he soon started a huge scheme for electrification of the rural areas, and works for setting up mighty electric plants were initiated soon after his taking over the authority of his country. coming back to our own country, it was only because of the promise made by the awami league to make revolutionary programmes for electrification of the country that the younger generation went en-masse to vote for them. unfortunately, the awami league has not yet been able to show that its promises will be translated into reality. the leaders of the awami league should not forget the fact that the younger generation of this country have no sentimental attachment for the awami league and their voting for the party is nothing but the manifestation of their frustration with the bnp.

poetry in the pain of ecstasy
rabindranath tagore is at the core of your being. the bengali in him approximates the bengali in you. as you recite his poetry or sing his songs, you remain aware of certain inalienable truths. and they are pretty simple ones as well. the bard speaks to you through the turnings in the seasons. in your turn, you speak to him, absorb his sentiments as it were. the result is a harmonious whole.

standing at the foot of the snow-capped mountains of the himalayas, rabi felt an overpowering sense of freedom. this was the first time in his young life that he had ventured outside the protected confines of his princely home and was amidst the natural surrounding he loved. he was only 11 then. strangely enough, this would also be one of those treasured periods of time he would get to spend with his father maharshi devendranath. rabi, in his later life, would call his childhood a period of 'servocracy' since he had grown up more under the tutelage of family servants than his parents. this trip to shantiniketan and the himalayas with his father was, therefore, all the more special to him.
more adaptations of tagore's works needed
for over a century, to bengalis everywhere, rabindranath tagore has remained a source of inspiration, as bright as the north star, touching all sections of literature and experimenting with almost every art form. each era has its own way of explaining the works of tagore. his plays are still staged regularly by theatre troupes in our country. both plays written by tagore and adaptations of his works, along with several hugely popular dance dramas, serve as elemental theatrical resources. talented theatre personality khaled khan recently spoke to the daily star on how he views tagore's work and its significance in the contemporary theatrical context.

a summit for concord
six months ago our nation witnessed a rare spectacle that generated some hope that politics of concord and cohesion will probably replace politics of confrontation and conceit. yes, i am referring to the brief exchange of pleasantries between begum zia and sheikh hasina at a function in dhaka cantonment to celebrate the armed forces day on november 22, 2008. one thought it was a thaw in the cold and estranged relationship between the two top leaders that kept them incommunicado to each other for 17 years.
is nepal going back to instability?
the developments in nepal stemming from the resignation of prime minister pushpa kamal dahal have not come as a surprise, even though the sequence of events may appear to be somewhat dramatic. a simmering tension was brewing between the coalition government of the maoist prime minister, who goes by the nom-de-guerre "prachanda," and the powerful army on a variety of issues, including the absorption of former maoist guerrillas into the army, ever since the maoists emerged as a force to reckon with in running the government.
what are the government's priorities?
it must be said that the government is to yet embark on any of the critical issues of public interest facing the nation with any degree of seriousness or urgency. so far the ruling party has been busy in petty squabbles and infighting. besides it is also busy in further "consolidating" its power base. god alone knows why? is there any real need for it? view the page startech
setting new dimension to outsourcing
for a country to move forward in this fast changing world there should be a proper balance between its imports and exports. while essential products like crude oil and fruits have to be imported at a high price, this also means that export oriented businesses like the garments sector and the shrimp and tea industry have to earn the foreign currency to compensate that.
