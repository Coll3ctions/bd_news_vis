our cricket and our shame
bangladesh has crashed out of the world twenty20 in nottingham. it was wiped out by a resolute ireland, raising questions about what could have contributed to bangladesh's embarrassment. the answers to those questions, as far as we are concerned, are not difficult to find. a defeat as shameful as the one our cricketers have just earned for themselves appears to have become the norm for our cricket. where this particular match against ireland is concerned, the sheer cavalier manner in which our players carried themselves during the course of the game makes us wonder if they were at all serious about what they were doing. not a bit of worry seemed to be there and no hint came of a need for a change in strategy once the wickets began to fall rapidly.
of ministerial explanations
being disingenuous is often a disturbing part of political behaviour. in this past week, the very enterprising and the very dynamic tanzim ahmed sohel taj has given us reason to think he could have been a little more frank with us. he has informed us that in the past five months, which means since the awami league-led grand alliance government assumed office, there have been no extra-judicial killings in the country. that is pretty upsetting, for the minister of state for home affairs knows only too well that what he says is quite a deviation from the truth. of course, he has gone to great lengths to distinguish between extra-judicial killings and deaths in crossfire. he has the right to explain matters in his own way. we have the right to disagree with him. the truth right now, though, is this: the killing of two students of dhaka polytechnic by the rapid action battalion is yet too fresh to be forgotten, unless the minister would like to believe that fast-enveloping amnesia is what we the people suffer from these days.

obama's speech
us president barrack obama's recent speech in cairo university was, on the whole, received positively by muslims across the world. in his speech, he has said that he seeks a “new beginning” with muslims around the world, based on “mutual interest and mutual respect.” he further said, “america and islam are not exclusive, and need not be in competition. instead, they overlap, and share common principles of justice and progress; tolerance and the dignity of all human beings.” all this clearly indicates that obama wants to remove the sense of hatred and mistrust that muslims across the world had developed for the us administration, during george bush's eight years, and find common ground between the us and muslims. he has also said that the suffering of the palestinians, over the years, is “intolerable.”

good initiative
without any hesitation, i would like to express my feelings about the initiative you have taken jointly with channel i to improve the conditions of the rivers surrounding the dhaka city. the pictures are unique to let common people know the real situation of the capital city. i believe this initiative will be supported by 99% people of the city. everybody wants to tell the same thing, but they don't have the voice to let the decision makers know the situation. the conditions of the rivers are precarious.
frustrated people
the mp of mirpur area has lodged a gd with the police station as he has received threats from extortionists demanding a big amount of money. this is the case of a ruling party mp! so, how general people are spending their days need not be explained. during the caretaker government's period, people were happy as the extortionists were on the run. but with the coming of the political government, the number of cases is going up and up and in the meantime a good number of people have lost their lives.
ground reality
unless we follow the instructions which we deliver to the voters, they will not care to follow those. this is perhaps the reason why incidents of vandalism, snatching, robbery, land grabbing, hijacking, car-jacking etc are not declining.
road grabbing
i congratulate the daily star for their endeavour to create public awareness about the adverse affects of encroachment on rivers surrounding dhaka. however, i want to raise the issue of encroaching on the roads. garage owners and rickshaw owners are occupying the roads, creating traffic jam in dhaka city and, on the other hand, car owners also park their cars on the roads, creating the same problem.
not the right course
we have seen a report published in the national dailies some days ago that the prime minister called a meeting with the ambassadors of the developed countries to seek financial help to make the dead river garai navigable by excavating.
waste management
as the amount of waste is growing rapidly and polluting the environment, the time has come to think about it very seriously. we cannot altogether get rid of waste, but proper management can certainly reduce it.
saving our rivers
i would like to thank you for your outstanding contribution towards the above.
climate change
the impacts of sidr are till visible in the costal belt, particularly in the districts of patuakhali, bagerhat, pirojpur, barguna, and part of shatkhira. a number of national and international ngos and other organisations have been still working with the local administration to mitigate the sufferings of victims through implementation of income generation projects, health and nutrition schemes, rehabilitation of roads and infrastructure etc.
dying rivers
thanks to channel i and the daily star for the programmes on the rivers around the city. we will be eagerly waiting to watch next episodes, although i was quite sceptical about the objective of the programme. nevertheless, this has been able to generate public awareness. it is well anticipated that these episodes would point fingers at the government to initiate measures to mitigate the sufferings of people made public through these programmes.
rajuk's plots
i am an expatriate who applied for the rajuk lottery for plots. little did i know what i was getting myself into. of course, the deadline for submitting the applications was december 2008, and ended up to be postponed quite a bit, finally settling in end of april 2009. as an applicant, and as a person who has made quite a significant payment of us $3500, i do believe that it is my right to know when the lottery will be held. is it going to be any time soon? or have the bigwigs still not decided on which of them (and of course, their friends and families) will actually get the plots, and how to pretend that the lottery is actually going to be fair? i guess that is why they needed the deadline to be extended: somebody's shala (brother-in-law) hadn't turned in the application yet. the lottery just can't take place, now, can it?
learning english
almost all students of our country have apathy towards english language as they do not venture to learn it from an early age. this foreign language creates a phobia among the students because they are not encouraged by their elders and surroundings to learn it from their infancy. so, students of our country are lagging behind and their elementary knowledge is poor. besides, our prevailing educational system is not satisfactorily updated. the system can still produce clerks , nothing else.
prohibitive prices
if you are a routine bazaar goer, you will feel the real pinch while buying either fish or vegetables. none of the very ordinary fish like puti, tengra, telapia etc could you buy for less than tk 200 per kg. and to mention the frail 'batashi' , it sells above tk 300 per kg! whereas these are the fish that the middle and lower middle class people could live on with the fringe of their limited income. we have no headache about other variety of fish usually bought by the rich from mega shops. who is there to look into this kind of rip-off by fish sellers? the old saying, 'mache bhate bangalee' that had some semblance until the recent past is now totally a stale and sour word to swallow.
