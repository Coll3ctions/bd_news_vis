turmoil in the rmg sector
workers' violence is becoming a threat to the stability and normal working environment in the garment sector. last sunday's violence in the readymade garment (rmg) units at ashulia and jamgarah areas on the outskirts of the capital city has again caused panic among the owners of the factories so much so that, according to reports, production has been suspended in 25 factories. this is certainly bad news for the entire garment sector at a time when it is already reeling from the supply-order shortage from the recession-hit international market. the international factors apart, gas supply constraint is another factor that has forced many garment units in chittagong to shut down.

captive power generation
the bss report published by many dailies on 8th july on the matter relating to reduction of renewal fee by berc for captive power plants is a positive step in the right direction, and a welcome move. since most captive power plants are sized to the individual power needs of the user, setting a flat rate is rather unfair. a possible solution could be a minimum fee of say tk. 2500 calculated say at tk100 per kw of generator rating. this will be different for each unit, based on its own generation capacity required.

bangladeshi politicians
many politicians say or pass many comments against their rival politicians which do not deserve answers. the educated and well-groomed politicians are cautious in making comments on national issues. ours is a new democracy and our politicians are also new in politics, naturally all of them are not well groomed. their background and entry into politics are mostly a picked-up process except those who entered through some political process and long struggles. modification is underway and hopefully in the next decade there will be much qualitative changes in the behaviours of our politicians. secondly, our politicians are tight-leaped because they are regulated by their party policies and have no freedom to express their opinions. in spite of all the restrictions and regulatory systems, we can see some dynamic politicians who speak wisely and cautiously saving their own dignity and acceptability. especially, the top leaders of all political parties have some sense of individuality and that is why we expect changes in future political culture in bangladesh.

rights of women
we keep reading in the papers over and over again about men beating up and murdering their wives, pouring acid down the throats of their own children. we read about how women and children working as servants get tortured by their employers. just the other day there was an article about how a man tied up his wife and locked her up in a medieval manner. it's really sad to see that in this day and age bangladesh is still not yet a civilised nation. i am really surprised that our honourable prime minister, being a woman herself, does not seem to be sensitive enough towards all such issues. i believe that stern action should be taken against the culprits. acid should not be available so easily in the market. i would also like to urge the women of bangladesh to stand up for their rights and not give in to their husbands so easily. men who hit women are cowards and thrive on the fear they create.
