criminals targeting cars
as many as 159 incidents of carjacking were recorded by the police over the last three months. and all these incidents occurred in the capital. one is certainly surprised at the figures. the bigger truth, however, is that the figures could be higher. be that as it may, the fact that such incidents have been going up in frequency points to the dismal state of law and order not just in dhaka but elsewhere in the country as well. it is clear that organized gangs of criminals are at work and indulge in their acts in various ways. sometimes they simply pounce on individuals in cars cruising on the road; sometimes they shadow a car before finding an opportune moment to terrorise the driver into parting with the keys. in many instances, car robbers have acted violently, leaving drivers wounded from attacks with sharp weapons. view the page sports

ramna park-a lost delight
we are all aware that lead-laced toxic fume all over dhaka city is a serious challenge to quality life. like numerous city dwellers, i, as a part of daily chores, visit the ramna park for a little respite. but, i am deeply saddened to note that olden days' pastoral and pristine beauty of the premier park in recent years has greatly disappeared:
share market scam

our currency notes
recently, bangladesh bank has requested all concerned to refrain from writing on currency notes (taka) as it causes financial loss to its bearer and damages it. we need to make people aware about this. but it is a matter of great regret that the major damages are often caused by the banks. bb provides notes tied with steel string punching holes through the notes. other banks also put seal and stick levels with gum on the notes. i hope bb would take proper steps to save our currency notes.
stinky water of wasa
dhaka is a city of numerous problems and miseries. it is also one of the most polluted cities around the world. both the authorities and the dwellers are to be blamed for this nuisance. the outbreak of numerous problems with numerous dimensions is a day to day phenomenon of dhaka city. the city residents are now getting stinky water. the water supplied by wasa is so stinky that one can hardly call it water! a few days ago, a leading daily reported that the water reservoir of wasa was being used for garbage disposal! drinking such water leads to serious health crises. the authorities must be sincere enough in ensuring safe water supply.
we want peace now
i have learnt from bbc that afghan president hamid karzai said : "again and again, for years and every day we have said that the war on terror is not in afghan villages, not in afghan houses of the poor and oppressed…...the war against terrorism is in its sources, in its financial sources, its sanctuaries, in its training bases, not in afghanistan. it was proven that we were right.”
internet facilities in rural areas
the number of internet users is increasing day by day in both urban and rural areas. many companies are giving their services so that people can enjoy using internet. but we need better service from these operators. majority of the people are living in rural areas and are deprived of internet facilities. enabling the rural people to access internet can empower them to bring themselves out of poverty.
lack of social etiquette
a few days ago, i participated in a national seminar on occupational safety, health and environment. at that seminar, i felt so disturbed due to frequent ringing of cell phones. it was so surprising that someone was talking over cell phone in the seminar room. we are used to spitting here and there even on a neat and clean floor. we are very reluctant to say 'thank you', 'you are most welcome' and 'i am sorry'. we walk making sound in a place which needs silence most. we do not want to stand in a queue for getting or doing something because we always are so busy. in fact, standing in a queue is more or less humiliating to most of us. these manners do not work in our country.
our affluent leaders
we feel excited and elated when we see that our 'big' and even 'semi-big' political leaders are affluent enough to go to renowned foreign hospitals and clinics for medical treatment! it seems that medical establishments, competence and facilities which our leaders have developed so far in bangladesh are meant only for the poor multitude, not for themselves! of course, to our leaders money is no problem! our big leaders have big pockets! our leaders fly to london, bangkok or singapore as we, poor dhakaites, take a stroll across gulshan or banani! and for them there is the 'perennial' source of forex lying with bb! certainly, our leaders' lives are far more precious than the lives of the poor masses! if they do not remain healthy and stout, then who will rescue us?

of nsu, graduation and the president
this letter is in response to the letter titled 'convocation day can never be sad.' i totally agree, i never used the word sad to describe the graduation; i, however, go on to call the graduation at nsu extremely disappointing judging by its shambolic organization. universities abroad host their convocations on campus, however, i don't think they leave the parents waiting to sweat for over an hour and run so ridiculously late on time. and i am also pretty sure arrangements are made so they sit where they can actually see the programme they are attending!
what's law got to do with it?
unarmed-yet-dead, osama bin laden could've made a valuable informant in fighting terrorism. however, president obama's dramatic announcement of a 'kill' order shows little or no intent of 'capture'. as the us pr machine prays for elation to wash away questions, the attorney general has assured legitimacy of the kill.
