cross-border atrocities
bangladesh achieved independence with the help and assistance of india in 1971. india sheltered and fed millions of our people during the nine months' war of independence. the war began against the background of a massacre of the unarmed bengali civilian population unheard of in history. unfortunately, the victims of the carnage were but the citizens of a state (the then pakistan) whose integrity the murderous army was supposed to protect.
alarming road accidents
there is not a single day that we pass without reading the news of road accidents in the newspapers. such news make us extremely sad and it is unbearable to read the description of the accidents. almost all the accidents are caused due to reckless and unskilled driving, bending of traffic signals as well as negligence and impatience of the drivers.
health care delivery in bangladesh
that health care delivery in bangladesh is in need of a major overhaul. the poor continue to die of preventable diseases, and infant and maternal mortality rates in bangladesh are very high. a recent study by the donor agencies once again emphasises the fact that the funds and schemes meant for the poor in bangladesh do not always reach them. evidence shows that health services are primarily accessed by the better off people rather than the poor.
need for a primary school
the government expressed its wish to establish primary schools in all the villages of bangladesh. but there are many villages in the country which have no primary school. the chondipur village of shadullapur at gaibandha is an example of such villages. most of the people in this village are very poor and illiterate. they do not bother about their children's education. only a few of them are interested in educating their children, but they do not have any scope to do that because they do not have a primary school in the village. so i urge the education ministry to establish a primary school in this village as soon as possible.
people of bangladesh demand ctg

roads should be widened
i was wondering who are to blame for the unusual rate of death on the roads. it is clear that most accidents occur due to bad road conditions, unfit vehicles and untrained driving. we think government has a great deal to do in these cases. we must immediately work out a long term plan to build a smooth and wide road network. to ease the burden on roads, we must develop the railway, waterway and airway sectors. a strong visionary leadership and accountability is needed for the smooth execution of that plan. i think money will not be a problem if we just have a good mindset. everything is first created in the mind. so the government must now decide whether they will waste national wealth on unproductive and reactive pursuits or for the good of the general people. time is running out very fast. people are angry enough to break the wall of fear and come onto the streets like uncontrolled deluge to wash away the stagnation.
the daily star's role appreciated
i would like to thank the authority of the daily star for expressing the 'apology' with an extra importance by publishing it on the front page of january 18, 2012. i appreciate your courage to refuse the money for that advertisement on ethical ground. when i first saw your front page article on 'doreen tower' (dec 10, 2011), i wanted to thank you for your fearless journalism. i wanted to take the opportunity to disclose to the people the fact that the owner of this doreen tower was the same person who has done the 'landscaping with a colourful fountain' on the public road!
