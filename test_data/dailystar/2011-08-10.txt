death metal, defined as “extreme subgenre of heavy metal”, still has more of a cult following than being mainstream. distorted guitar tunes, thrashing riffs, blast-beat, double-time drumming and the growling or croaking vocals with mostly unintelligible syllables are the signature traits of death metal. if one takes metallica and megadeth as standards of heavy metal, he/she can safely assume that death metal bands are even thrashier and more violent sounding -- often showing more technical prowess. some bands belonging to this subgenre with a considerably large, head-banging group of fans include: morbidangel, cannibal corpse, obituary and others. view the page op-ed
