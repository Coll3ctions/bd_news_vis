long holidays, empty classrooms
the thought that children in bangladesh spend less time in school than children in other saarc nations is dispiriting. with the state of overall education being a live public issue for the past many years, this latest bit of information only reveals what should have been obvious to all and why action on it should have been taken earlier. we cannot but begin doing that by noting the scarce or non-existent classroom interaction between teachers and pupils at present. and that is precisely where the problems begin. with such a staggering number of holidays, 137 days to be exact (apart from unscheduled ones owing to political agitation, natural calamities and the like), such interaction can only be wishful thinking. whatever classroom engagement there is at present is abysmally low and does not even come up to regional standards.
arbitrary newsprint price hike
the impetuous raising of price of newsprint by local manufacturers goes down as a bad example of market manipulation in absence of any competition. clearly, the manufacturer has cashed in on its hold on the monopoly market. the cost of newsprint accounts for 50 percent of the total cost of production of a newspaper; therefore, the price hike has actually struck at the core of the industry. we fail to understand when the previously imposed 30 percent duty on imported newsprint has been drastically reduced by the government, why must the local manufacturers take such arbitrary decision on grounds that are not justifiable. we protest the move with the strongest of words.
it is never too late
crime and punishment have attracted the attention of the people from the dawn of history. while in the earlier years punishment was more connected with scriptures, the advent of modernism gave rise to the recognition by humanity that it is responsible for law, both political and moral, and, by extension, the state of the world. even the constitution of the nuremberg tribunal was criticised on the grounds that without law to fit the cases the tribunal would essentially pronounce ex-post facto political judgment.
a bali diary
the rich are different from you and me; they have the same airport. the first casualty of globalisation is identity. every airport in the developed, or wannabe-developed, world looks the same: a confusion of corridors, conveyer belts, junk shops and a profusion of winding queues at immigration. you can recognise a nation from the look in the queues. there is faintly hidden arrogance on the faces of officials in receiving countries, and barely-disguised relief in the manner of passengers chasing some better horizon than their native land can provide. delhi is somewhere in the middle, there is both ebb and flow.
nepal elections: a great event
nepal is set for the landmark elections on april 10, with all eyes set on the voting that comes following a phase of uncertainty and instability, promising a new chapter for the nation. contending parties have great stakes in the polls, and the balloting has special significance -- rather than just producing victors and vanished. the election atmosphere has already been marred by an acrimonious climate, and violence has raised fears. however, just ahead of the voting, things by and large still look conducive for a credible election. the electioneering has reached a crescendo, with all keeping their fingers crossed about the shape of things to come. view the page sports

students and our history
student politics and ''weapon'' politics in universities and other teaching institutions are not the same thing. so banning student politics may not be healthy for the nation at all. in the last few months a number of so-called intellectuals and non-intellectuals have written, arguing against student politics. the reality is that when big boys ''and big girls'' have failed to understand our politics and economics, it is the students who have shown them the way through theory and practice. there is definitely no question of using weapons, but why should student politics be banned to degrade intellectual and creative ideas? the same point applies in the case of teachers' politics as well.

mobile phone manners
those of us who recall the pre-mobile phone days will remember that it was quite something to have a telephone at home. people who did not would approach their neighbours if they needed to make calls. some people would put their phones in boxes with secure locks on them. nowadays anybody can have a mobile phone. but the self-important feeling of having a phone still remains. we are so much conscious of our phones and pay so much attention to them that it makes us forget simple manners and our respect for others. we see important people at important meetings stop or disturb the proceedings by answering calls on their mobile phones. with heads lowered they whisper unimportant things while keeping others waiting.

ostrich mentality?
i am an expatriate indian muslim working in bangladesh for the last two years. everyday i read articles about conditions on bangladesh, especially about its worsening power and water situation and how nothing is being done to bring about a change in the situation.
in response...
i am writing in response to the letter (april 2, 2008) from dan rees.
our 1971, our allies
i thank syed badrul ahsan for his article, “our 1971, our allies and our truths” (the daily star, april 4). i completely agree with him that we cannot deny the valuable contributions of the indians during our liberation war. and hence the government, in inviting the indian generals recently, has shown a great gesture. we cannot forget that in that time of distress, horror and unimaginable plight, it was the indians who provided us with the necessary support. had it not been for their help, we may have had to endure greater ordeal.
greasing the palm
much is being said and done (?) about reducing the levels of graft-- an epidemic in bangladesh! definitely resisting graft is our moral fight, as reported by your satkhira correspondent on 23rd march.
it is our shame!
it is certainly a matter of shame. women in bangladesh are not safe, though it is the 21st century. a report in a national daily on march 27, 2008 revealed that taslima, who had been violated by a mill owner, died in hospital. if we look deeper, we can see that some very common factors have fuelled this incident.
water and washing cars
as good citizens of dhaka, we all believe in a healthy environment, but often we sacrifice this by using too much water to keep our cars clean. of course, we all want to have clean cars. however, do we realise that keeping our cars clean means using up a great deal of water? even though cars get dirty quickly in dhaka, if we save water, we will have more to use for households and businesses and maintain a green environment. we propose that the dhaka city authorities enact a law relating to people washing their cars only one day in a week. but you might say, “i want my car clean for a fancy occasion." you can plan your week to wash your car on the day of the event so it is clean the day you go to the special occasion. even though windows may get dusty often, you can use your window wipers to clean them without wasting extra water.
trees on rooftops
we know that trees are the elements which produce oxygen (o2) and at the same time absorb carbon dioxide (co2). they thus balance the o2 and co2 in the environment, which is very important for human beings and animals as well. but in dhaka city, the number of plants and trees is coming down to zero gradually. we need o2 but we live in co2. so, i suggest that we grow plants and small and medium sized trees on every roof in dhaka irrespective of whether they are privately or government-owned. i also propose that we make it compulsory. at first people should be motivated. after that, perhaps from 1 january 2009, some penalty may be imposed on those who ignore the matter. a minimum number of trees must be grown as per space available on the roof of a building. in this way we can get some more o2. without o2 we cannot but die. view the page international
