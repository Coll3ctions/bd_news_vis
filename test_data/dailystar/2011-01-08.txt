“o villain, villain, smiling, damned villain! my tables----meet it is i set it down/that one may smile, and smile, and be a villain!” hamlet, after his first visit with the ghost of his father, portrays how a villain may look like. as we move on to read shakespeare, we are faced with evil characters as half of life is naturally in the hands of evil people because, in the bard's own words,“ the web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together”. the predicament of human life lies in his inability to delve deep into the human psyche, the bard clarifies, “as there is no art to find the mind's construction in the face”, we have to put up with all, men and women, good or bad because “readiness is all” and “some innocents escape not the thunderbolt”.

serious issues, considered thoughts
“from ethnic and linguistic points of view, bangladesh is one of the most extraordinarily homogeneous countries in the world. yet politically she is so deeply divided that according to the assessment of failed state index, she is poised on the precipice of state collapse. with a fragile resource base, centuries of exploitation by alien rulers and recurrence of devastating natural calamities, she was dubbed as an 'international basket case' and a 'test case for development'. yet in last three decades, she succeeded in doubling her per capita income in real terms and in graduating from low human development to medium development category. these positive developments took place against a backdrop of rapid erosion in governance.” thus does akbar ali khan, in the curiously titled friendly fires, humpty dumpty disorder, and other essays summarize the paradox that bangladesh appears to people who take more than a cursory interest in that country. he explains the significance of his title in the preface, and the reader will comprehend its relevance.
stories out of a tale of freedom
revolutions make history. and yet, in more instances than we would care to remember, history becomes the first casualty at the hands of those who try recapturing it in their analytical formulations. in bangladesh, certainly the product of a revolution brought about by a concatenation of seismic events stretching particularly from the mid 1960s and going all the way up to the end of 1971, history or an interpretation of it has remained an intrinsic part of the national consciousness. despite our misgivings that along the way (and that was after the rightward lurch the country took in august 1975) bangladesh's history took a battering at the hands of those who followed bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman to power, the historical narrative has remained pretty much in place. but, yes, there have been the efforts at an embellishing of it, with sometimes clear, deliberate moves being made to minimize the role of those who were pivotal in the struggle for liberation. and, of course, following august 1975, the brazenness with which history was sought to be diluted was to lead in time to crises of critical proportions. the price is still being paid by the nation.
love among the mughals
out of a brothel, perfumed desirably and trailing a mysterious bloodline, an 'overly pretty' traveler reaches the magnificent court of mughal emperor akbar. despite his foolish choice to wear a coat of coloured leather lozenges in the heat of fatehpur sikri, the traveler wittily introduces himself as 'mogor dell'amore', the mughal of love. as akbar falls prey to his silvered tongue, the yellow-haired traveler starts to relate a story of love which can 'make his fortune or else cost him his life.'
