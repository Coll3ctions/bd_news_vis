noise pollution
noise pollution is one of the emerging threats to health. the ill effects of acute and chronic effects of noise are though well known to doctors and scientists, people of bangladesh are largely ignorant about it. we not only damage our health but also many pregnant women, aged persons and children are badly affected by it. increasing noise level in public places from various sources, industrial activities, construction, generator sets, loud speakers, public address systems, music systems, vehicular horns and other mechanical devices have deleterious effects on human health and the psychological well being of the people.
wretched mothers
a ds report entitled 'love lost, yet it goes on' was published on 15th february, 2009 which reflected the agony of a wretched mother who is confined to bed and kept under treatment. her progenies don't inquire about her and left her in a miserable state. i would like to thank ds for publishing such news and making us aware of those hapless persons who are neglected by their sons or daughters in the final stages of their lives. it is a common feature in bangladesh that parents don't have any individual dream and all the expectations centre on the welfare of their progenies. but in many cases, people are reluctant to provide mental support to their parents and also to pay attention to their medical needs in their old age. it corroborates that nothing can be more demonic than man and nothing can be nobler than man.

law and order
i am so much concerned about the law and order situation that has deteriorated after the political government's coming to power. i am really frustrated to see the return of things that we almost forgot during the caretaker government's regime. almost every day we get news of murder, hijack, roadblock, brawls etc. i don't know what is going on all over the country. i don't know why the administration became slack after the formation of a political government. i think the government should take immediate steps to find out the reasons behind this laxity. if the previous caretaker government could make it happen, what's the problem of a political government?
what is going on?
when i went to live in road 33, gulshan 2, in 2007, i was very impressed by the development of the lakeside pathway which extended right up to the bridge at kamal attaturk avenue. it was an enchanting walk. all human life was there a real glimpse of what i believe is the real bangladesh - rich and poor, young and old, enjoying the beauty of the scenery. i took lots of photos.
underground railway for dhaka

politically motivated cases!
the reports carried by the dailies of 18 feb. 09 said that the present government was going to drop cases lodged against some leaders, activists and supporters of their rival parties by the last alliance government which were reportedly framed purely on political motivation. the government has already moved ahead on the issue and constituted committees to examine merits of those cases. most of the people will support and welcome the move because people believe that none should suffer for not doing any wrong and only wrong doers should face trial and get punishments.

the boy was too short. his friends laughed at him and he felt very unhappy. then the mother of the boy started feeding her son a particular brand of powder milk. miraculously, the short-statured boy became taller than his friends and the boys began to call him "bhaia".
local government and mps
a fundamental question is, why do we need members of parliament ? the answer seems quite simple. since our population is very large and they can not represent themselves in state governance, they require to elect somebody to act as their attorneys in the 'jatiya sangshad'. so, the only job of an mp is to look after the interests of the populace. but the field realities are quite different from their assigned job descriptions. we find that the public representatives are more interested in cars, jeeps, land plots and other perks.
smelly wasa water
i am a resident of shantinagar/nayapaltan locality of dhaka city. for over a month or more, we have been experiencing the worst kind of water quality supplied by dhaka wasa; the stench and sewer-like smell make it impossible to drink and all kinds of boiling or filtering would fail to get rid of the stench. food prepared with the water itself becomes smelly. i am not sure of the risk of health hazard as it was not tested but if bad smell is any indication of health risk, this water would score a perfect 10 in that scale. view the page international
