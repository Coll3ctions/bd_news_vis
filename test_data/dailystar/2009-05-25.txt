the plight of returnee migrant workers
the loss of jobs which bangladeshi workers have recently faced abroad against a backdrop of global recession is not only a matter of concern to the victims but to the country as well. the pain comes from the fact that these poor bangladeshi migrant workers have been making their way back home in heart-rending circumstances. and once home, they have found themselves in graver difficulties because of all the loans and the interest on those loans they have to pay back. with not a dime in hand, the future for these workers seems bleak.
invasive polybags all around
despite a ban on the manufacturing and use of polythene bags, unscrupulous traders have been marketing substantial quantities of the banned items openly violating the law. the influx of polythene shopping bags in the recent years makes one wonder whether the traders enjoyed some kind of protection from certain quarters in the environmental administration as well as law enforcing agencies. the ban was imposed in 2002 to save our environment from the onslaught of the non-biodegradable material that found their way to city drains and storm sewers, thereby blocking normal flow of waste water. polybags have also clogged river and canal beds, threatening normal breeding of life forms in water.

poverty and vision-2021
our population is predominantly rural, with about 85 per cent of the 135 million people living in rural areas. for their livelihoods rural people depend mainly on the land, which is both fertile and extremely vulnerable. most of the country is made up of flood plain, and while the alluvial soil provides good arable land, large areas are at risk because of frequent floods and cyclones, which take lives and destroy crops, livestock and property.
nazrul's indomitable spirit
nazrul's incomparable writings, in a very short spell, established him as a genius in the arena of bengali literature.
indian democracy
success of indian democracy stands in stark contrast to the bloodlettings taking place in other nominal south asian democracies -- pakistan and sri lanka. these nominally democratic countries have failed to bring peace and prosperity to their people because of their propensity to resort to violence for political change. india's success in running a relatively violence-free democratic process has been mainly due to mahatma gandhi and his legacy of non-violence.
bottled water
i was very surprised when i saw a report on mineral water on channel i on 4th april. the water in the mineral water bottle was completely un-purified. some wicked businessmen put their company sticker on the bottle, capped and supplied these bottles to many hotels, restaurants, collages, offices, food shops etc. those companies had no bsti approval. they filled water directly from the tube well.
senior citizens' woes
please allow me to begin by asking " who cares for the has beens? yes, today's 'has beens' were yesterday's major players keeping the country's wheels of economy and government moving. come tomorrow, today's young turks will become tomorrow's 'has beens' and so on as the wheel of time turns. the common factor, however, in both stages of one's life is that he is not relieved from the duty of paying taxes till he is stowed in. thereby, he continues to retain the life membership of the taxpayers' club.
reports on bdr carnage

praiseworthy decision
undoubtedly, teachers are the torchbearers of the nation. but they are very much neglected here.
cng run vehicles
this may sound funny, insane to many, but i suggest the government ban cng driven vehicles as the government is so concerned about security and terrorism. funny but it is true that when a car enters a hotel, hospital or the secretariat, one will notice that a group of people in uniforms will ask you to open the trunk of the car and will certainly look under the car for some sort of explosives or guns/ammunition, i don't know what else. these so-called checks not only delay the entry but also help the congested traffic to clog up at the back. by searching the trunk and the bottom of the car what have they found so far is a question to me and to many others who often face this unnecessary so-called security checks. the security personnel don't bother to look inside the car or the bags kept in the trunk or the seats which are the most likely place of carrying explosives. also, they never ever check the front where the engine is located. they will check and let you go like the sunrise and the sunset factor.
indian elections
indian people voted decisively in their national election. they voted for stability, secularism and good governance. they rejected extremism and sought development including nuclear co-operation. in this election indian muslims returned back to the oldest secular party and voted for it. in reality indian voters have shown their political maturity. rahul gandhi in his protracted effort of ascendancy to national leadership is crowned with remarkable success. he made definite headway in hostile uttar pradesh politics. by appreciating the opposition led state government he created an atmosphere of political tolerance. in this election indians have witnessed the grooming of their future leadership.

early marriage
after completing my ssc exams, i went to my native village to meet my relatives and maternal grand parents. by the way one of my cousins took her ssc this year. though she lives in a village, she is very talented. moreover, her aim is to become a doctor. but it should be noted here that her parents are not educated. so, they are no longer eager to send their daughter to college.
us and israel
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu is not the ruler of israel. he is the president of the united states! the president of the united states could break israel in a day. if they'd stopped sending all that money and all those arms to israel, israel would have long ago been overcome.
