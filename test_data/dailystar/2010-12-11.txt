disentangling the fear factor
democratic and freedom-loving citizens of bangladesh would be disappointed and shocked to read the cover story of the weekly star of 3rd december with regard to the fear factor. the report says that torture and death in custody are becoming institutionalized strategies leaving society scarred and terrorized. it very ominously comments that successive governments have tacitly given law enforcement officers the freedom to arrest anyone indiscriminately, sometimes a license to kill if necessary.

literature and the reader
how are readers affected by literature? apart from how writers look at literature and language, how does genius treat language? what do words do to us, and what can we do to words? what are the effects of technology on language? can lowbrow readers offer their views on literature? or is it 'like corpses looking for an undertaker', as ronald coase has remarked. he is the nobel prize winner for economics in 1991, and one who never had any formal education in this discipline.

the state of israel: conflict of faith & the future
once again, so-called middle east peace process has been reoriented by yet another us president barak hussain obama. he struggled for the middle part of his name while campaigning for the election. that bitterness may have had some impact in his later foreign policy decisions on middle east. as the days progressed, we became very clear that the rhetoric of a young, enthusiastic presidential candidate would end up in nowhere and nothing could change the big brother's foreign policy direction. the root strength of netanyahu's adamant and arrogant position on settlement issue lies where- need not a further explanation. reality is- nobody can fix the ever complex middle east conflict unless everybody concerned goes back to the old days and apprehend the origin of the crisis.

recently, a team of bangladesh army participated in a joint training exercise with the indian army in jorhat of assam. this is for the first time that military forces of the two neighbouring countries have done so. in the very recent past, six members of bangladesh army, including two officers, participated in a mountaineering expedition. those were the events that offered both the countries opportunities to interact with each other and benefit from the experience thus gained.

awakening those sleeping thoughts
the “zahir” is a mystical force that draws a man, humbles him to the last bone. it is an incredible force that leaves a man sleepless, steals his peace of mind and has him chasing it to the end. to the protagonist of this book, his wife is the “zahir” to whom he gives his life time. the wife of a famous writer disappears one morning from their home in paris. the writer is arrested on suspicion of having done away with his wife. he is bailed out by his friends but the police and the public still hint at his involvement in the disappearance of his wife. leaving the public to muse on their own suspicions the writer takes the unknown roads to find his wife. the story is the remarkable account of the writer's search for his wife through the dark mysteries that seem to pursue all roads that lead to her. an intriguing love story is weaved into the saga; the story of undying love of a husband for his wife.
