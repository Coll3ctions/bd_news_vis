maximum and minimum temperatures are measured using thermometers mounted inside a wooden box with slits, called stevenson's screen, which is generally kept facing north. the maximum thermometer is mercury-in-glass - as the temperature rises, the mercury expands and moves freely up a constriction in the thermometer. when air temperature drops, the constriction prevents the mercury from flowing back due to higher pressure, and gives the maximum reading. the minimum thermometer is alcohol-in-glass and is kept horizontally inside the box.
