khaleda lands in sub-jail
a dhaka court yesterday sent bnp chairperson khaleda zia to jail and placed her younger son arafat rahman koko on a seven-day remand a couple of hours after they were arrested on graft charges at their cantonment residence.
the mandate that khaleda zia wasted
seldom did an elected leader, especially in parliamentary democracy, receive the type of popular mandate as khaleda zia did in 2001. in fact she is the only leader who got elected as prime minister twice (we are not counting the controversial election of february '96) in our country's history. of the 15 years of our unbroken succession of elected governments she was in power for ten years. in the last election in 2001 her party, the bnp, alone won 194 seats in a parliament of 300 seats. with her allies, her total strength in parliament was 217.
bnp split imminent
a split in bnp now seems only a matter of time as the detained party chairperson khaleda zia expelled its secretary general abdul mannan bhuiyan and joint secretary general ashraf hossain from the party for their alleged conspiracies to break up the organisation.
koko & commission
arafat rahman koko, younger son of former prime minister khaleda zia, amassed huge fortune allegedly by taking huge bribes in exchange for approvals of deals through the use of influence of his family dynasty.

rights activists for fair trial
human rights activists have demanded fairness and transparency in the trial processes of the detained chiefs of the two main political parties.
moments before the arrest
she seemed reluctant to meet her fate. as law enforcers knocked at the door of khaleda zia's house at 5:30am, she appeared on the veranda more than 45 minutes later and asked: "why are you here?"
her letters to bhuiyan, ashraf
bnp chairperson khaleda zia expelled secretary general abdul mannan bhuiyan and joint secretary general ashraf hossain from the party, according to notification letters sent to both the leaders.
arrest proved impartiality of government
law, justice and information adviser mainul hosein yesterday said the arrest of former prime minister khaleda zia has proved the impartiality of the government.
ensure due process of law
the united states and the united kingdom have urged the caretaker government to ensure due process of legal and constitutional rights in dealing with former premier and bnp chairperson khaleda zia, who was arrested along with her youngest son early yesterday.
tense hours
4:40am: four vehicles of the joint forces enter dhaka cantonment through jahangir gate and move towards khaleda zia's shaheed mainul road residence.

khaleda's arrest
the ex-pm's arrest does not come as a surprise. in fact the news of khaleda zia's impending arrest had been in the air for sometime, particularly after the arrest of sheikh hasina. many had been left wondering after july 16, 2007 as to what kept an immediate past pm out of the reach of the law while an ex-pm, whose tenure of office had been long over, was incarcerated.
keeping universities closed is no solution
it is time to reflect on the recent incidents around dhaka university again. we need hardly reiterate our feeling that the violence, which erupted on august 20, 21 and 22 was a matter of deep sorrow for all of us. it should not have happened. but it did, and we are aware of the repercussions that followed. both the student community and the army were affected and, in a broad psychological sense, it was a whole nation that suffered in those few days.

janmastami -- the birth of lord krishna
it has been specifically proclaimed in the "bhagavad gita" by lord krishna himself that he descends to this mundane world at different ages whenever it becomes necessary for protecting the virtuous and the innocent from the atrocities and cruelties of the devilish and the oppressive, for establishing religion in its true glory and sublimity by eliminating the evil. following this unequivocal celestial commitment, lord krishna, as the embodiment of supreme eternal personality, descended to this planet earth on the eighth waning night in bhadra during rohini nakshatra (asterism) posing as the worldly son of devoki and basudev. it is this enchanting descent of lord krishna to the earth that is celebrated as janmastami by the hindus the world over.
hindu philosophy and lord krishna
the hindu culture and tradition is not derived from any one prophet or founder. it has neither a uniform creed nor any organised church. its history and prehistory are ageless. the vedas, which are the scriptures of the hindus, are unique in character. we find in the vedas a great variety of subjects and a great flexibility of doctrines.
priorities and challenges before the government
