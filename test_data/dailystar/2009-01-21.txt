break-in at railway offices
the daring break-in at railway headquarters in dhaka as well as its offices in chittagong is stunning in its scope and dimension. the very fact that 56 rooms at the headquarters in dhaka were left ransacked, along with a theft of documents from the chittagong office, gives every indication of its being an inside job carried out to near perfection by those involved. the question naturally arises, therefore, of what might have motivated the perpetrators of the act. and the answer, in all likelihood, is that the break-in was related to sweeping dirty linen under the rug. important documents, are said to be missing from dhaka and chittagong offices. those engaged in corruption over the years and now feeling the heat quite properly may have organised the raids as a way of removing evidence of their crime.

cultivation of tobacco
the general belief that tobacco is a profitable crop is the principal reason for farmers taking to it. once they begin, the hardship still does not convince farmers to switch to other crops, due both to lack of awareness and knowledge of cultivating other crops and inability to have loans and other services, including assistance in selling the crop. through the aggressive activities of the tobacco companies, a farmer is “coaxed” into tobacco farming simply by watching his neighbour “graduate out of poverty” after cultivating this crop. such a demonstration effect could be achieved for other crops as well.
israel's terrorism
in this ruthless world we repeatedly witness events which are too distressing to be described in words and clichés. even in this enlightened era, sophisticated brutality frequently reigns over the trampled emblem of humanity as the civilized world turns deaf to the desperate calls of the oppressed. the harrowing pictures of the gaza carnage everyday remind us of this unacceptable and yet inescapable axiom. it's easy for political analysts to put responsibilities on several factions while seating in luxury cabins. world leaders, who have been silent for long, are now engaged in formulating complicated reconciliation schemes, instead of taking immediate pragmatic initiatives. the international community is engrossed in its pursuit of the hard facts while concrete actions are needed to end the gloomy misery of a confined race dying hopelessly. i guess today only the innocuous palestinians who are being brutalized mercilessly can sense the concrete 'hard facts'. the hard fact for them is that as the civilized world silently watches they have to count the bloodstained bodies of their infants and endure the merciless zionist butchery.
