early indications from municipal polls
as we write this editorial, the votes are being counted in the 49 municipalities for which elections were held on thursday. while it is yet too early to make any clear assessment or analysis of the overall election results, seeing that a fairly good number of municipal polls yet remain to be decided, we do believe that the rather peaceful manner in which the elections have been held so far says something about democracy in bangladesh. the fact that elections were held without any disturbance in rajshahi and rangpur divisions on wednesday is a tribute to the professionalism demonstrated by the election commission, to the maturity displayed by the political parties and to the democratic character of the voters as a whole. so far the municipal elections have pointed to the sort of democratic behaviour that we have long yearned for in this country. it is our trust that such an attitude on the part of all will be maintained not just in the remaining municipal polls but in future general elections as well.
