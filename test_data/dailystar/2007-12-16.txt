recalling the great victory of 1971
we remember the historic victory the bengali nation achieved on this day in 1971. a recapitulation of it pacquires increased intensity when we recall the many tribulations and the immensity of suffering that went into our national triumph. the emergence of the sovereign state of bangladesh in 1971 was not a run of the mill affair brought about by political negotiations around a table. it was an achievement arising out of a concerted war of national liberation, in which tens of thousands of men and women in the mukti bahini in particular and the people of bangladesh in general put their lives on the line as they sought to send the pakistan occupation army and its local collaborators packing. it was a war forced on us and over the nine months of it 3,000,000 of our fellow bengalis were to die; 200,000 women would be raped by pakistan’s soldiers; 10,000,000 would seek refuge in india and whole villages and towns would be left ravaged. we opted to hit back, to let the enemy know that the country belonged to us and that sooner rather than later his stranglehold on bangladesh would go.
