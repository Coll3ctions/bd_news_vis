database plan for farmers
the plans the government has of introducing a database for farmers should be looked upon as a positive endeavour. that is because of the demands of the times, when modern technology has clearly become a trend in such a significant field as the economy. besides, the fact that bangladesh has traditionally been dependent on its agriculture as the mainstay of its economy makes it critically important that all manner of information regarding its various facets as well as its problems and prospects be kept in view. if the government is serious about developing a full-fledged database for farmers as a step toward providing the agriculture sector with inputs and other services, there are certain points which must be looked at first.

it is utterly disquieting that dhaka, being the capital city of a developing country, has no modern taxicab service for citizens. whatever exists in the name of the service is but a mockery that offers more pain than comfort to the helpless travelers. the dilapidated and ugly looking metal structures on wheels that ply on the city roads with total impunity are mostly run by unscrupulous people who fleece passengers at every opportunity as these vehicles do not have meters or any fixed fare charts. often drivers join gangs of criminals at night to rob lone passengers. these gangs also operate a chain at the airports to force passengers in hiring their vehicles and at a fare determined by them taking advantage of their vulnerability. and it all happens because of an unprecedented lack of monitoring by any designated authority.

the south is another country, in just about every country. no one associates the north of france with holiday, cuisine or luxury. the north of italy wastes its time in production, profits, brand-building, grumbling and fantasies of secession; the south goes to church, forgets to collect the garbage, remembers to collect tourists and has fun. would berlusconi ever build a private palace improved with putin beds and exotic weekend guests in north italy?

month of restraint
holy ramadan, the month of restraint, is coming for the muslims. although there is the practice of “fasting” in all religions, but a month-long fasting associated with other rituals are unique. ramadan fasting, if practiced fulfilling the recommended criteria, will purify the soul and contribute to leading a healthy life. in this connection it is the individual as well as the social responsibility of the muslims to come forward to ensure that the spirit of the holy month of ramadan is maintained to qualify themselves to receive the promised reward from allah, the almighty. let us do away with our traditional practices that contradict the true spirit and teachings of ramadan, e.g. some isolated muslim sections start and end the ramadan fasting a day earlier than the rest of the muslim population of bangladesh. ramadan fasting is to be started and ended on moon sighting. geographically, bangladesh is a tiny county and there is a little time difference between different areas. so, moon-sighting time cannot differ so much that ramadan can start on different days. we should remember that fasting is prohibited on the eid day. so, all muslims must be extremely careful on this matter and the government and the islamic scholars have specific responsibility to bring unity on the issue.

an appeal
mobile phone hijacking and stealing has become very common, especially in city areas. i can hardly find any mobile phone user whose mobile has not been either hijacked or stolen. in the last six months my wife lost three mobile phones and one of them was pick pocketed, one was hijacked and one was stolen. moreover, some criminals threatened a businessman after stealing the phone which caused lot of troubles to us. in this regard, i would like to request the mobile phone companies to make a device so that the real owner of the mobile phone can stop using his or her mobile by informing the secret number to the relevant company after it is lost. mobile companies always advertise their services but ignore one of their most important services for the users.

every day newspapers are full of news like 'declaring the fifth amendment illegal', 'pilkhana carnage', 'criminal killed in shootout with rab',' ctg arms haul', 'acc act to be reviewed',' jesssore udichi blast', 'war tribunal', 'trial of war criminals', 'militants issue' and many other issues like these. legal news very often takes the place of lead news in the newspapers. obviously, in a democratic country application of law is a routine matter. as if our life is immersed in the system of law like that of air around us. we take oxygen from air and likewise we take life support from the legal system.
young ministers
inclusion of a number of young ministers in the cabinet by prime minister sheikh hasina reflects her farsightedness and goodwill to develop future leadership. of course some are of the opinion that in this crucial time of global recession and diplomatic congestion, senior leaders should be given more importance in case of placement and deputation. meanwhile, i believe that the young leadership opted for is appropriate. moreover, those younger members who have been included in the cabinet are well qualified and energetic. here i would like to mention the name of dr. shireen sharmin chowdhury who has recently been included in the cabinet as a state minister and given the responsibility of children and women affairs ministry. she possesses a strong academic background, intellectual ability plus excellent human relation skills.
violation of law
nowadays, it is no use writing letters to the newspaper. it seems the persons responsible are not readers of the newspapers, nor do they bother about the grievances that we general people express through this page. the complaints, sufferings of the people fail to create any impact on their minds.
attention, honourable pm
