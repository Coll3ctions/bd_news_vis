an appallingly bad idea
we are alarmed by the information minister's comment that the government's plans to introduce a law aimed at preventing what it calls yellow journalism. our response is plain, simple and without ambiguity. we believe that if there is yellow journalism in certain instances and if the government means to act against it, there are sufficient existing mechanisms to do it. a new law cannot be the answer to the problem. it will only become a problem by itself. the answer lies in empowering press council and allow it to do its job professionally and independently. certainly there could be news reports which might be false or designed to malign individuals, groups and the government. but those reports can be dealt with by the press council once strong measures are in place to ensure the absolute independence of the body. we suggest that an independent press council is the appropriate body to deal with all matters regarding allegations of bad or motivated journalism. it must be provided with adequate funds, manpower, indeed infrastructure in order to function without fetters of any kind. that is what the government should do and not formulate any new law.
dhaka university's turning 90
eighty-nine years ago on july 01, 1921 the dhaka university was founded fulfilling the long cherished dream of the then population of east bengal. the idea of establishing a university for the relatively unserved section of the bengalees living in the eastern part of greater bengal came to the mind of the imperial rulers after a deputation of high ranking muslim leaders, including sir nawab khwaja salimullah, khan bahadur chowdhury kazimuddin ahmed siddiky, nawab syed nawab ali choudhury and a. k. fazlul huq, met lord hardinge, the then viceroy of india, on january 31, 1912 and expressed their fears that the annulment (of partition of bengal) would retard the educational progress of their community. this highest seat of learning in this agricultural hinterland of greater bengal, in course of time, truly became the centre of intellectual excellence as well as that of political thinking and movement. view the page sports

the great woman
june 19 was the birthday of aung san suu kyi, a living legend. her birthday was observed all over the world with tremendous enthusiasm. the whole world loves her. but where is she? she is under house arrest.
football festival
the whole country has worn a festive look with colours of brazil, argentina and other favourite football playing nations flying on rooftops, bamboo poles, huts, shops and even vehicles. t shirts and stickers of those flags are selling like hot cakes. youngsters have shown their loyalty to the favourite nations by vandalizing vehicles on their failure to watch the games because of load shedding. some buet students blew their future for wc by making the authorities close down the highest seat of education in our country. my wife won't watch any bangladeshi programmes on tv. she prefers refined acting in refined bengali of west bengal to bangladeshi low comic drama serials in local dialects. should i blame my wife? should i point finger to the youngsters for their showing emotional attachment to the countries that have made neatness and transparency their guiding principle? so to make our youngsters proud of our flag that we achieved in return of blood and tears, first we have to ensure good governance characterized by benevolence, austerity, honesty, accountability and diligence on the part of every citizen.
a new vista for agriculture
jute, the golden fibre of bangladesh, once again makes presence in the media as its genetic coding has been decoded by a bangladeshi scientist in collaboration with other aiding agencies. being a deltaic country, bangladesh has to face a number of natural disasters round the year. the avaricious activities of humans on environment also add a new dimension to such kind of calamities. farmers are keeping themselves away from cultivating jute. moreover, the malpractice of jute collection through local agent for government factories at lower rates has worsened the situation to some extent. though we are the second largest producer of this fibre after india, the present situation is not encouraging at all.
what's wrong?
we have bigger problems in the country. so let us not just irritate the football enthusiasts by criticising them pointlessly. during the world cup season people of different cultures become one. it's a phenomenon, not that we can have such phenomenon every day! it brings us all together in a global festival. we dance, sing the same song. at this point of time, there is no difference.
menace
the buses in dhaka city are a great menace.
who is responsible?
the other day i was passing through the mohakhali flyover. traffic was terrible! vehicles were bumper to bumper. on my left was a heavily loaded mini truck. what caught my attention was the way goods were tied up to the body. it was so carelessly tied up that it seemed it might fall down any time and cause an accident. i was thinking what if the goods fell down on a car! i asked the driver why he tied the goods that way. he reluctantly said, “it's perfectly alright. it will never fall down.” i asked what if it fell down. he said, “then it would be an accident. and nobody has control on accident.” then i told him i had taken a photo of his truck. he grinned and said, “i don't care at all.”
private universities
with reference to the editorial published on your newspaper on june 13, 2010 entitled “vat proposal on private universities be withdrawn”, i would like to thank you on behalf of students and guardians, for your positive perception on this issue and producing the write-up.
buet closure
buet, the highest seat of technical education in the country, was closed sine die on such a trifling issue that we cannot but feel worried. it appears that junior students thrashed up their seniors to close the university to facilitate viewing world cup football matches. nothing can be more shameful for this traditional institute. the authorities should take tough actions against the rogue students to keep the buet image high.
bank pay scale
this is the recent news that the nationalised banks i.e. sonali bank limited, janata bank limited & the agrani bank limited, including bangladesh bank, are going to have a separate pay scale. already, the banks have submitted their proposed pay structure to the ministry of finance. i think that this a very good & effective step of the nationalised banks, because the private bank pay structure is much higher than the nationalised banks. there should be a balance. our neighbouring countries like india, pakistan & sri lanka have separate pay scales for the nationalised banks.
land developers
the housing ministry had called a meeting to discuss about the detailed area plan (dap) of rajuk with rehab and bangladesh land developers association (blda). in this meeting, the state minister of housing faced an impolite behaviour of a businessman.
import of used cars
all the countries in the world have made our country a dumping ground of old cars which they do not want to keep in their own country. you must impose immediate ban on the import of used cars.
power generation in sylhet
the present capacity of the running power stations in sylhet zone is about 500 mw including 15 &3 years rental and small ipp. these plants are run by gas and gas is also available there. the present peak hour power demand of sylhet zone is about 250 mw. the balance 250 mw cannot fully be dispatched to other areas where there is shortage of generation due to limitation of transmission facility. as a result, the sylhet zone remains surplus in generation and suffers no load shedding.
al in disarray
it seems that the al is ruining itself. the party has lost focus in every field after the huge election victory. this is characterized by :
health for all
the 1978 declaration of alma-ata described health as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” health is a “fundamental human right.” attainment of the highest possible level of health is a very important world-wide social goal. by 2000, everyone should enjoy “a level of health that will permit them to lead a socially and economically productive life.” achieving this aim would necessitate financial and community expansion. but primary healthcare, “based on practical, scientifically sound and socially acceptable methods and technology” made universally accessible to individuals and families, was supposed to be key to attaining the target. by 2000, there were significant health improvements, with increases in life expectancy in 163 of 184 countries for which data are available (between 1975 and 1995). expenditure on health has also risen, with global spending on health accounting for approximately 8 percent of the world's gross domestic product (gdp). however, there are massive disparities in the health status of rich and poor countries and the goal of “health for all” has clearly not been met.
untrained drivers
we the city dwellers travel by bus. it is part of our daily life. bus is our essential mode of transport as it is the cheapest one. however, day by day buses are getting overcrowded and noisy. the situation has been worsening fast. i need to travel by bus from kakrail to baridhara to attend my office. the drivers and helpers not trained properly.
tragic
recently, a woman reportedly committed suicide in the city's jurain area with two of her young children. it's really regrettable that some children are not safe even in the custody of their parents. i think marital conflicts of adults must not victimize children. the entire incident represents the sickness of the insensitive grown-ups that children endure in our society. i can understand that the woman had to bear the intolerable traumas of a broken relationship and she had to put up with the alleged abuse by her husband and in-laws. i really sympathize with her for her ordeals. however, that doesn't make her awful act of persuading her own children to commit suicide justifiable. she should have had some compassion for her children. she shouldn't have made them the victims of her own misfortune and emotional turmoil. instead, if she had raised her children with resilience, someday her children might have proven to be her ultimate strength in life.
alcohol
if humans want something, they will do anything to get it, it's human nature. it's the same with alcohol---some people drink because they say that some drinks are good for health and some people drink for pleasure. it is a sad fact that an estimated 6.6million children under the age of 18 live in households with at least one alcoholic parent. as a result our future generation will repeat the same thing as we always follow our parents.
