end of the puja season
for the hindu community, as also for people of other faiths, religion is all about the moral base on which we conduct ourselves in the temporal world. when durga succeeded in subduing the sinister mahisashur and thereby reasserted the triumph of good over evil, it was much more than a tale that was being told. since every aspect of religion is a symbolism for life and for the realities beyond life, the observance of durga puja is a reminder of what we must do to regain for ourselves the high moral ground we lose constantly owing to our all too human frailties.

political developments
i think we had quite a number of news reports on the prospect of the election to be held in december 2008. i put them down as i consider them to be very disturbing to get a definite answer whether the election is going to be held on dec 18 as announced. these are:
population boom
the letter "population boom" written by engineer shafi ahmed was published on 22 september'08. it correctly emphasised the successful family planning programme to limit the size of the population. please refer to gen moeen u ahmed's recent article on food security in the country where he touched on the issue of population boom and consequent problems. i think this issue is very important and the nation should consider it seriously.
automobile menace
“why is it that men and women, normally courteous and considerate…should all of a sudden revert to selfish, snarling savages the minute they get behind the wheel of an automobile?” --miller mcclintock.
save trees
deforestation is a word that is understood all over bangladesh. we, the people of madaripur, have no familiarity with deforestation for lack of forests in this area.
time to act
since its birth in 1971 bangladesh has passed through many a tumultuous year to reach today's stage where we are set to see a “reasonably free and fair “election”. i say this because the main data from which the voters exercise their right of franchise--the voter list-- is for the first time a “genuine” one. thanks to the tireless efforts of the personnel of the armed forces and the election commission and their focused approach.
the icl and bcb response
bangladesh cricket has already absorbed a shock after the loss of 14 players.
a letter to mayor
this is my first letter to the mayor of dhaka city corporation, mr. sadeque hossain khoka, also a member of parliament, to draw his kind attention to the terrible traffic congestion from airport station to rajlaxmi complex. i request the mayor to take immediate steps to relieve the people from a daily traffic congestion during daytime, especially on the way to office, and while returning from office from 8:00am to 2:30pm.
"art" reflecting a decaying society
a disgustingly offensive statue, labelled as a work of art, displayed in a gateshead gallery, is indicative of the moral decay of secular britain, and its inability to create a cohesive society that can accommodate people of any religious faith. it is sufficient to say that any muslim who has stumbled across the description or image of it could not but be hurt, offended and outraged.
american presidential election
it is amazing how the american election has gripped the attention of the people of bangladesh. leading newspapers are carrying news, views, and observations about the possible outcome of the election. people are discussing about it everywhere. they get up early to watch the programmes, which are being telecast live on cnn. it is almost like the advertisement on the cnn, “ do not disturb, watching cnn”.
overseas education
in the last four-five years, the number of the consultancy firms for overseas study has increased significantly in the country. but most of them can often be deceptive. what is commonly seen is that at first they compel students to open a file charging a considerable amount of money, which is one kind of cheating. they also manage fake sponsorship for the students which fails to provide support in some cases, it is revealed that the full amount of the tuition fees is not paid to the foreign institutes. consequently, students face great difficulty abroad. they have to repay the unpaid amount for their courses.
why ban cricketers?
ok, some bangladeshi players have joined icl for money. no crime has been committed as far as i can see. what would be so sinful if these players can earn some money by doing things that they do best.
national health policy
a new version of national health policy has been published and is available on website. it contains many elements that can introduce several good things in the health sector. it has a proposal for reactivating bangladesh medical and dental council. actually the medical council of all the civilised countries controls health services much more than the government does. but the irony is that about fifty percent of the doctors serving in government and non government organisations are not registered. the proposed policy also contains the element to control the quality of drugs, that may go against some manufacturers. actually the quality of drugs produced in the country still requires control. it has one unique element to strengthen the referral system and also manpower development.
failed cricket?
since i have expressed my feeling about the "parade of failure" by our national cricket team under the leadership of ashraful, a lot of events have occurred in our failed cricket. the icl issue, action of the board, comments of the cricket lovers in the media, and today we had the opportunity to listen to our captain in his usual style. he seems to have forgotten that he had the responsibility to inform the board and the countryman immediately after he had received a very lucrative offer from the icl which he turned down in the national interest. what a stunt to justify his integrity when his captaincy should be at stake. i think he is suffering from moral crisis which demonstrates that he should not take the responsibility of leading the national team. he is perhaps waiting to hear what he needs to do now.

durga comes to new dhaka
nabami night. soothing fall breeze. around 10:30 pm things should be slowly winding down. approaching the banani ground on kemal ataturk avenue suddenly changes the mood. subtle white fairy lights illuminating the venue, which does not resemble its usual self. the queue moving fast and in an orderly manner through the entrance. the ground has been levelled with bricks and carefully covered. beautiful pillars have shot up; alpana and set by amity kundu (the late artist nitun kundu's daughter) and amit chando, are anything but gaudy -- a spectacular vision.

business syndicates: real or imaginary?

the american anti-intellectual threat
in recent years, the united states has been more a source of global instability than a source of global problem-solving. examples include the war in iraq, launched by the us on false premises, obstructionism on efforts to curb climate change, meager development assistance, and the violation of international treaties such as the geneva conventions. while many factors contributed to america's destabilising actions, a powerful one is anti-intellectualism, exemplified recently by republican vice-presidential nominee sarah palin's surging popularity.
