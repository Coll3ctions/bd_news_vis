the spirit of march 7, 1971
we recall today a moment of seminal significance in the history of our nation. on this day in 1971, as the bengali nation was being made acutely aware of the sinister attempts to deprive it of the mammoth victory it had collectively achieved through the general elections of december 1970, bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman prepared to show us a path out of the woods. and that came through the sheer eloquence of the speech he delivered before a million-strong crowd at the race course (today's suhrawardy udyan). what has come to be known as the march 7 address remains critically important for us because it was a protest against the reluctance of the pakistan military junta to honour the results of the elections through letting a democratic government take over. and it was much more.

bangabandhu soared, and so did we
as bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman rose to speak before the million people gathered at the race course in dhaka, indeed before the seventy five million people of bangladesh, on march 7, 1971, the moment turned electric with excitement. for the preceding few days, reports and rumours had been making the rounds about an impending declaration of independence by the man whose party, the awami league, had secured a clear majority of seats in pakistan's national assembly at the general elections of december 1970.

interplay of harmony and discord
indian prime minister manmohan singh, in a moment of pique, had once famously declared, in reference to bangladesh, that “we can choose our friends, but we cannot choose our neighbours.” how true! bangladesh can, of course, turn the lament around, and that will quite faithfully reflect the roller coaster ride that the state of bilateral relations between dhaka and new delhi has undergone since the substantially smaller neighbour emerged as a sovereign independent country. hemayetuddin, a retired foreign secretary of bangladesh, and currently working as a director general at oic, did two tours of duty on his country's behalf to its very large neighbour, first as a junior diplomat, and then as high commissioner. a neighbourly affair: assignment india is hemayetuddin's account of his, as much as the bangladesh government's, diplomatic engagement with india, a country that obviously fascinates him. there is a liberal dose of personal anecdotes with diverse personalities, but there is also a good deal of bilateral foreign policy issues that serve to highlight the seesaw nature of relations between dhaka and new delhi.
an alcoholic tale, or an exposure of evil
in an alcoholic tale (literally, because the entire gamut of characters of the novel turn to liquor), aravind adiga chooses to expose the evils of indian society stretching from laxmangarh to bangalore via the indian capital new delhi. adiga's journalistic reportage in time magazine (he had been a new delhi correspondent of time for quite a few years) definitely makes its mark in his booker winning debut novel the white tiger . it chronicles the india of the 21st century from the perspective of a lower caste indian, if not from adiga himself. the witty and pungent satire used in the novel are at times didactic and prophetic, leaving it to readers to settle whether they should pay heed to the prophecy of a person coming from the north indian ghetto who likes to introduce himself in a wryly elevated term as “an entrepreneur”.

the schoolboy soldier
