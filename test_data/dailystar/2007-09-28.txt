dhaka's improving corruption image
in the berlin-based transparency international's corruption perception index (cpi) bangladesh has bettered its previous ranking of 3rd most corrupt country to the 7th position. she is clearly breaking out of the cycle of being perceived as the topper in the corruption perception index. this is an inspiring sign. the explicit reason for our corruption perception score remaining at 2 is that this year's index was heavily influenced by data for 2006. as prof muzaffer explains the score could have declined if the positive results achieved between january and july this year did not offset the worsening corruption data of 2006. in a way therefore, there has been a positive effect of the drive against corruption under the interim government.

don't punish them
i fully endorse the views expressed by mr. ahmed ilias in his letter to the editor dated 19 sept, suggesting equal rights to the non-bengalis. on the other hand, the statement made by mr. m. emdad, oxford, uk in his earlier letter is extremely biased & does not conform to the thinking of the modern day democratic & liberal people. at a time when everyone of us in our country is striving for a society free from communalism and racism, we should not be preoccupied with such a notion.

mourinho quits
jose mourinho's sudden exit is a serious setback for english premier league superpower, chelsea. the self-described "chosen one", had certainly played a big role in transforming chelsea into one of the major competitive teams of epl. in fact, under his tenure, chelsea has won two consecutive league titles after 50 years and after a long time, finally, manchester united and arsenal had to face a new rival, a major rival in the form of a new, star-studded chelsea. some might be of the opinion that chelsea has managed to play so well in the recent past due to their star players but even real madrid had a dream squad consisting of players like zidane, ronaldo etc but the spanish giants failed to shine despite having such great players. so, even if a club has star footballers, at the same time a club also needs an able coach, a coach who has the ability to organise the team properly, set appropriate formations and plant useful strategies. mourinho had all these qualities. he had charisma in abundance and his pragmatic approaches helped chelsea climb to the top.
campus life
getting admission in our public universities is almost like wining a lottery ticket. quality education, low cost, prestige and so on are the factors behind this big race for admission. after getting admission comes the question of accommodation in residential halls. campus accommodation is one of the biggest facilities one gets for studying in public universities. but there is a shortage of seats.

charges against hasina
in his advice to the people who are demanding the release of sheikh hasina, mr. aziz ahmed (ds letter, september 19) asked them to demand an open trial to clear her name of all the corruption allegations brought against her. in the process, he has cited the precedence set by a former pm of canada, brian mulroney, to clear his name from an rcmp investigation. although brian mulroney, undoubtedly the most despised pm in canada's history, was not the best epitome of honesty and integrity while he was the pm, it would be worthwhile to cite about a case against mr. mulroney filed as recently as last july. an arms dealer sued mr. mulroney for taking $470,000 from him in 1993 for helping him to set up an arms factory in quebec and a pasta factory in ontario, the commitment allegedly mr. mulroney did not follow through. no, the rcmp did not send 1,000 men squads, some of them with bullet proof vests and dog squads at wee hours of night to arrest the former pm to frame charges against him. neither mr. mulroney nor his lawyer attended the court for hearing on the scheduled date and a default judgment was handed down against him on july 24. mulroney appealed to the superior court and the lower court verdict was set aside on august 3 by a superior court judge indicating that default judgment was egregious and wrong. it was a dispute between two individuals and the crown (state) attorney was not involved in any way.

campus police
recently, a number of letters were published suggesting the use of campus police at du and other public universities to stop campus violence. some suggested the use of highly educated (master's degree holder) cops, since, according to them, it becomes an issue if a less educated cop takes actions against educated students! wait a second, give me a break first of all, how could someone, in his right frame of mind, even think that a master's degree holder would pursue a career as a campus cop, and particularly in a place like du, where, the so called (some, if not most) educated students have a history of beating up cops and vandalising public or private properties, whenever they feel their demands are not met. don't you think it has become students' hobby to burn and destroy vehicles, buildings, or even beat up people (who don't agree with them)? i wonder how could some people think that an educated cop would be able to change this trend among the students. as a former student of du, i saw many times how such fighting started on du campus (some of which eventually led to death and destruction) and in most of those cases, things were always made worse by some 'so called' unruly people ( i was never sure if they were regular students), whose attitude could only be compared with creatures that you see either in the discovery channel or in your city's zoo.
stranded pakistanis
i do not agree with ashraf parvez on the stranded pakistanis issue. these so called pakistanis have been staying in bangladesh since the independence of bangladesh. if not all some of these people have now their second generations staying in bangladesh. those who belong to the second and even third generation are by birth bangladeshis and speak and write bangla very well. these pakistanis may want to go back to pakistan but not everyone wants to migrate. some are doing very well in small businesses and others are earning well using various skills. even the usa or canada does recognise the birth right. tagging everybody under the same label as traitor is not right. for instance, in the uk and usa some muslims were involved in destructive activities, so does it mean the usa and uk will deport all their muslim citizens? it does not make any sense. bangladesh may be an over populated country, but granting bangladeshi citizenship to these stranded pakistanis will not bring any change to its population as these people are already in bangladesh. rather, bangladesh should set an example for other countries granting them the citizenship. these people should be given a choice between pakistan and bangladesh and those who want to stay in bangladesh should be given every right to stay in bangladesh. these people have suffered enough. view the page international

global warming, kyoto protocol and developing countries
in the face of mounting debate on the disastrous effect of greenhouse gases, scientists agree on the other hand that as a natural process the effect makes life on earth possible. this is a process by which various gases act like the glass of a greenhouse, trapping heat near the earth's surface. the greenhouse gases are naturally occurring and include carbon dioxide, methane, water vapour and other trace chemicals. but it is now known that man-made chemicals have caused a massive build-up of greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere. precisely true, human activities are changing and enhancing the greenhouse effect. we are, so to say, thickening the walls of the greenhouse. and those activities that contribute to the build up of these gases include the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, certain agricultural activities and industrial practices. scientists have warned time and again that this sort of profligacy with nature, this wanton destruction of forest wealth will only invite grim and disastrous consequences for us like the colossal deluge we have witnessed in 1988, 1998, 2004 and the most recent one.
