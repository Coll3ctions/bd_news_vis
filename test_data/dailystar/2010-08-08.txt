prices during ramadan
as a matter of fact, prices of certain essentials have been on the rise before the customary consumer concern centred on the month of ramadan set in. the step that the government have taken in the meanwhile relates to fixing prices of edible oil at the factory gate and those of sugar and meats like beef and mutton. the price of bottled soyabean oil has been left unfixed. and, sellers have reportedly made it known that bottled edible oil will be pricey, because its supply to the market has been reduced, presumably by the dealers.
tragedy of a deep social malady
the suicide attempt by a mother in kamalapur area in the city and subsequent deaths of her son and daughter leave us marooned with the question: what psycho-social factors had worked in collusion to push a mother to the path of self-destruction in a manner that was most horrific? we know there is no straight answer to explain the complexity of the situation but social thinkers and researchers ought to find out why there is a sudden increase in the tendency to take one's own life, particularly by married women, that again after killing their own children. by no means it is a healthy sign for a nation that aspires to build a just and peaceful society for every citizen. view the page sports

tuition fees
recently, the private university students and chittagong university students protested against the increased tuition fees. from the very beginning the tuition fees of the private universities were high, but it has become a routine to increase the tuition fees every year. most of the private universities don't even have their own campuses. but the tuition fees are raised regularly.
minimum wages
recently, the government fixed the minimum wage of a garment worker at bdt 3,000 per month. it is an increase of bdt 1500 per month. it looks like very high increment on paper. but would any economic expert give a breakdown of bdt 3000 to prepare a monthly household expenditure for a worker within this fixed amount? i am interested to know how much would be spent on housing, on food, on clothes and other incidental expenses including medical expenses for a single person. i have not included any recreation expenses because those are not for the workers, as they are not considered humans by the owners but parts of machine.
poor patients
some people come to dhaka only to get treatment in dhaka medical college hospital. the number of doctors and nurses is very few compared to the number of patients. hence, the patients are deprived of proper treatment. the beds are always booked and the new patients have to lie on the floor. according to a news channel, the cleaners and other staff replace the doctors at night and carry out operations even. the condition is same in every government hospital. this is the reason why rich people don't go to government hospitals for treatment. many tv channels and many newspapers have tried to show the problems of these hospitals, but still no change has occurred. thus, the poor patients suffer a lot and often die due to lack of care.
violent protests
it is not the right way in which the garment workers are protesting against the declared minimum wages. it is extremely shocking for the whole nation that they vandalised a number of shops and lots of vehicles as part of their protest. protest should never be violent and destructive causing a huge damage to public property. all demonstrators could have gathered in front of the relevant ministry to express their demands.
our identity
in muslim countries like iran, afghanistan, turkey, malaysia, the first name of a citizen is arabic and the last name is based on their own cultural background. for example, the iranian govt took an initiative in 1960s and successfully re-established persian culture in naming. only in bangladesh our names, both first and last, are arabic.
constitution amendment
a staff reporter's front page comments on the subject was published in a local english daily on july 25th, quoting the views of mr. moudud ahmed, which was apparently sensible, logical and fair. however, his proposal about 'equal representation' from the opposition was in that context illogical!
use of nicknames
the letter from one of your readers on july 31 is spot on and quite relevant in our global village. in bangladesh nicknames are fashionably added at the end of a person's name quite regularly. this would not matter if such persons were confined to their native places, as local customs would clarify what is the real name and what is the nickname. but with prosperity most people travel abroad nowadays for business, for jobs, for education, etc and there the problem of family name or last name arises. in all european countries and other places where european civilisation prevails by descent, last name of a person is his/her family name, for example- smith, blair, brown, sarkozy, merkel, putin, etc., showing a family connection by which name his/ her ancestry and their movements can be traced over hundreds of years.
metro rail
dhaka has a population of 13 million. not only that, it is one of the densely populated cities in the world. the traffic congestion of the city is increasing day by day as millions of people are living here, without any proper plan made by the dcc authorities. already the city authorities have taken many initiatives to solve the problem but all the measures have failed. the govt is thinking about introducing elevated expressway, metro rail and many modern facilities. statistics show that the most populated cities in the world have such kinds of advanced modes of communication. but dhaka has no such modern communication system.
changing the constitution
all the recent hue and cry from various people about our constitution, following a landmark verdict from the country's highest court, apparently indicates that they are ignoring a major factor concerning the issue while trying to guess the future outcome, and it is the name of our country. the name of our country itself clearly bears the suggestion on how to solve an issue pertaining to the constitution which is the basis of governance. it is good news that a parliamentary committee of experts has been formed after the court verdict to sort out ways on how to proceed with its suggestion, and at the same time it is unfortunate as the opposition has refused to co-operate with it thinking that the committee itself is going to finalise the changes. it is bemusing why and what makes the opposition think like that. as far as my knowledge is concerned, the constitution of a state dictates the basic fundamental principles by which it is to be governed; and therefore, it is understood that no government can direct its 'director' on how to direct (changes /amendments) simply because it is having a majority in parliament. people of the republic have selected and elected their representatives to form a parliament for planning, organising and running the day to day business affairs of the state, but not to manipulate or reshape the state's basic pillars.
democratic norms
in the last three decades, we have observed the two major political parties making below-the-belt remarks about each other's leader. a political party is defined by others, and defines itself, as much by its ideology as by the leadership it decides to have. it is rather self-serving for any party to insist that its rivals and detractors should not discuss about its leader. a debate about leaders, their flaws and their merits is at the heart of democratic give and take. leaders do bring value addition to their parties. in fact, most of our political parties are increasingly becoming leader-centric.
a pertinent question
the seventh amendment to the constitution, which legitimises hm ershad's takeover of power and the acts under his military rule, could have the same fate as the fifth amendment, said law minister shafique ahmed. the seventh amendment ratified the proclamation of martial law and other regulations, orders and instructions by ershad between march 24, 1982, and november 10, 1986. a writ petition, filed on january 24 this year, challenging the legality of the amendment is pending with the high court. we are yet to know the fate of this writ petition.

new sewerage line needed
the sewerage line of wari residential area is more than half a century old. it has damaged, collapsed, blocked and become inoperative in many places. dirty and stinking water and human excreta overflow the manholes and float on roads, streets, lanes and by-lanes and nearby municipal drains polluting the different localities.
house rent
it appears from the media reports that some people have sought the help of higher courts relating to tenants' grievances against landlords. as a small flat owner, i was earning tk. 5,000/- per month in july 1989 when the highest pay was tk. 6,000/- per month as per the pay commission. today i am getting tk. 18,000/- per month while the highest pay as per govt. scale is around tk. 60,000/- per month. in the above context, what should have been the rent of my flat? on the other hand, the flat can be sold at tk. 50,00,000/- (fifty lakh) and thus i can earn tk. 5,00,000/- (five lakh) comfortably as interest by keeping the money in banks. what should be my choice when i come to look for a good tenant, pay bribe to officials of income tax, wasa, land revenue, dcc etc. etc.
acc
reformulating the anti corruption commission (acc) is a need of the hour. it is indeed one of the pledges of the government made before the last elections. it is really good thinking by the govt that it must protect its civil servants before they are put into trouble. so, before filing any case against the govt servants, the acc should obtain permission from the govt. otherwise, the acc could file cases against innocent officials resulting in their harassment both socially and financially.
sanchay patra
at a time the rate of interest on sanchay patra was 16-22%, the monthly expenditure of a moderate family was tk.15,000/-. now the rate is 10.35-11.25%, when the monthly expenditures of an old individual is over tk.20,000/-. if the sale of sanchay patra is limited only to old ones ( 58 years and above), females, disabled, orphans, the rush of purchase will come down. then the idle and the ill earned money shall go to share market and private enterprises.

on political party reform
