a positive draft
we welcome the draft electoral law of the election commission (ec) for the very reason that it has incorporated many of the hitherto unfulfilled aspirations of the people of the country. the ec made it clear in the draft that if any candidate attempts to hide or give false information about personal records or election expenditure, his/her election results will be cancelled and the seat will be declared vacant. there will be provision for holding re-election for that seat at a later date. the other pertinent point is that political parties will also face cancellation of registration for failing to submit an authentic election expenditure record of the party and individual candidates. here we find the provision of outright cancellation a bit severe, and feel a system of issuing a first warning and then suspension for a specific period could be introduced. if a party failed for the third time to come up with the accounts, ec will then take the final decision regarding cancellation of registration. nevertheless, we strongly hold the view that these are some of the basic tenets without which no credible election can be held.

national security council for bangladesh
i once sat in a high profile meeting when the country had an elected government as a director general in the foreign ministry. those who attended that meeting were the ministers of foreign and home affairs with their respective secretary and top level representatives of civil and military intelligence. security issues were on top of the agenda of that meeting. i was astonished to learn at that meeting that on crucial national security issues, the foreign minister was in total darkness and that intelligence available to the military was unknown to the civil intelligence. at the home ministry, what the secretary knew was not in his minister's knowledge. since that strange meeting, i always felt bangladesh needed a national security council for a professional and transparent way to deal with national security and intelligence issues that are vital for formulating the country's foreign and defense policies.
islam, muslims and terrorism
islam is being invariably associated with terrorism both in media as well as in political circles, especially in western countries. when they hear it being condemned by muslim theologians, it is celebrated as something unusual. it is strange irony of both misunderstanding and motivated propaganda that if a small band of osama's followers give call for jihad, it is taken as authentic islamic call and if it is condemned by mainstream islamic theologians, it is accepted with mixed feelings of celebration and skepticism. the mainstream condemnation of terrorism is somehow not accepted with conviction.

the rise and steady decline of our cinema
although not unprecedented, yet bangladesher cholochitro shilpo assuredly is rather unique in the sense of its being the product of a research work carried out systematically and that in turn attains academic standard as a thesis. the book raises a number of questions, diagnoses the malaise that has been eating into the vitals of our film industry, in particular since the 1980s. once the diagnosis is made correctly, etiology is determined and thus very confidently the writers come up with a prescription to be administered to cure the ills of the disease prevalent in the films that are there.
brick lane observed in great passion
the first question that would possibly pop up in one's mind even before one starts reading salaam brick lane is why tarquin hall wanted to write a book on brick lane. but, then, when you begin reading the book, you will discover the fact that the writer must have felt passionately about the whole of the east end neighbourhood. his salaam brick lane is an honest account of what led tarquin to be in brick lane and what happened once he was there.
depicting the power of the male
zaitoon, a young girl of sixteen, is going to the hilly regions to be married to a “tribal” whom her father has chosen for her. she has been brought up by qasim since the partition of india in 1947. as the british fled the country after ruling for over 200 years, they sowed the seeds of communalism. the muslims and the hindus have since been rivals. there were riots in every part of the subcontinent in order to make it their respective strongholds. no one knew which part would belong to whom even till the last minute while the country was being demographically changed. lahore, a stronghold of the wealthy hindus, was supposed to become part of india. but it went to pakistan. jullander, sikh territory, was allocated to india. qasim flees from jullander; on the same train travel sikander and zohra with their two children from ludhiana. when the train reaches lahore men squatting on both sides torch the train and kill as many people as they can. munni loses her parents and holds on to qasim, who finds solace in holding a child who reminds him of his lost one. after that they live as father and daughter.
the birth and death of a state
the bangla terms 'darshan' and 'darshonic' imply very grave meanings which are related to philosophy and philosophers respectively. the inner meanings of these terms are comparatively clear to students and teachers of philosophy. ordinary men's understanding of them is of course rather different, perhaps even difficult. and yet ordinary people can understand 'darshan' easily when it means 'to look at' or 'to see'. but a 'seer' or 'onlooker' cannot be a 'darshonic' in any sense. the author of the well-known, notable prize-winning book pakistaner janmomrittu darshon has rightly claimed himself as an onlooker of the birth and death of pakistan and also as an expositor of the philosophy of its birth and death in light of the traditional socio-political history of our subcontinent.
