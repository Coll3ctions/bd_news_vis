khaleda as party president for life
the bnp standing committee's decision to make khaleda zia the party president for life is unprecedented in our political history. this is an unmitigated disaster for inner party democracy and a slap in the face of demands for reforms. this is in blatant contradiction to, and fundamentally out of sync, with the aspiration of the people. all democratic persons are outraged and must condemn this move in the strongest possible terms.
horrendous traffic jams
it is stating the obvious that dhaka's traffic system is on the verge of collapse because of inept handling of vehicle flow by the authorities, especially during peak hours. on a daily basis, thousands of vehicles of every description are seen stranded on the roads thus creating a snare of horrendous proportion. the tailback jam not only causes valuable fuel to burn uselessly, it robs people of their precious man-hour, and often claims lives of seriously ill patients.

hsc results
this year's hsc results have broken all previous records with ease both in terms of pass rate and a+ count. on the face of it, it is a very auspicious sign. but if we dig deep into what has happened, we have good reason to be worried. i think the standard of script evaluation has fallen to an all time low. never before did so many students get a+ in english. so a proliferation of a+ in english might lead us to believe that the generation next has got over the perennial vulnerability in english. i tell you the situation is far from being like that. the way they have been handed a good grade (in most cases undeserving) would do much harm to them in the long run. if a student who has got a+ in english fails to speak and write the language with minimum of precision, the system that gave him the highest grade will be devalued. it is not to say all students getting a+ are undeserving. of course, there are some highly deserving candidates. but, i don't think the same thing can be said about the majority of a+ achievers. it is not their fault that they got an a+ gift. perhaps, some powerful short-sighted high-ups are at fault who like to take credit for virtually everything.
war on terror redefined
the ghastly 9/11 is a dark day in history, that witnessed the most inhuman attacks on the humanity at large that led to the destruction of the american twin-tower, and a same kind of attack on the pentagon in 2001.
dynastic image
every year 6th september is observed as defense day in pakistan. this year it brought double rejoicing among the supporters of the ruling people's party as its chairman asif ali zardari has been elected president of the country.
drowning incidents
despite an abundance of coverage in our newspapers on the number of drowning incidents, including the rising number of students drowning in cox's bazar, drowning is still an under-recognised problem in bangladesh.
obama and the future of us
two of my most favourite canadian columnists are dan gardner of the ottawa citizen and margaret wente of the globe and mail. they are among the most analytical minds who should be read in all journalism schools. their comments about u.s. presidential race are extremely interesting.
traffic jam
these types of writings are very much common in the dailies ( just like the traffic jams on the ways and roads!). on 11 september shamim murad suggested timings for the educational institutions and others. i agree with him. however, i want to say something more about the permanent removal of traffic jam from the capital city. for this, the first thing to do is that all the garments factories and other such types of industries should be shifted from dhaka. but will the owners of these industries allow this to happen? yes, they will, if they are assured of the smooth transportation system from their industries to dhaka. i think it is not very easy to launch metro rail service in this unplanned city. again fly-overs are also very much costly and it will not provide a permanent solution. so if transportation system is developed outside dhaka, industrialists will find comparatively cheap labour and will establish new firms outside dhaka. and this disintegration will obviously help the city to remove the overflow of working class. we all have to think about the average speed of dhaka city at present and what it will be in near future. so the authorities should take necessary steps to construct roads and highways connecting the districts with dhaka and ensuring smooth and speedy transportation. is it very much costly?
benevolent leaders
after the french revolution, the concept of benevolent leadership emerged! some of the members of the royal family of france took refuge in the far-away princely states of india for escaping the wrath of the then revolutionary french people.
disgraceful!
the incident that took place on 4 september in natore was really barbaric. the lives of sumaiya, nupur, runa, arpita barua are now almost ruined. what is their fault? the attack that has been launched upon them is sufficient to destroy the country's image. while they were busy in their peaceful meeting for establishing “bangladesh college of physiotherapy”, they were brutally attacked. how could it happen in a civilised country?
my dream government
while the national election is looming with uncertainties, i figured why not just fantasise about a government that i think will win it all. i hope all the readers will join in and share their dream.
same politics, same people
in the western world when there is election defeat, the head of the party resigns & the new leader comes with fresh ideas. in our country, we want some change but it's not coming. still the people are running behind the motorcade of the politicians who betrayed them for so long. most of the time the “chamchas' are running their motorcade. we never think how much money, power & wealth these “chamchas' have.
battle of minds
the mega venture titled 'battles of minds' of 2008 is going to start soon. recently, the british american tobacco bangladesh (bat) & the department of business administration jointly organised a workshop to prepare the contestants of shahjalal university at the 'seminar room' of the department. it was an excellent arrangement.
in response...
the government's initiative to start all the schools at 7.30am is indeed commendable. as a resident of dhanmondi, where most schools (english medium) are located, i would definitely stand up for this new rule. this redirection will certainly help to curtail the horror morning traffic scene in dhanmondi, where the roads are populated mostly with the vehicles of school goers. it is ridiculous that a lot of time and effort are wasted being stuck in traffic early in the morning every weekday.
ropeway to solve traffic jam
ropeway can be designed and established using the high storied buildings in dhaka city. in this process in each area of the city certain multi-storied buildings will be selected and the ropeway will be established in between them. thus the whole city will be covered. this can be very effective to solve the existing traffic jam and transportation problem in the city.
police enquiry
the caretaker government has done an excellent job by separating the judiciary from the executive immediately on assumption of power, which the political governments failed to do even after decades of promises. this is yielding good result.
harassment of female students
the issue is intimidation and teasing of the female students by teaching staff. it is an offence allegedly committed against the innocent girls students who are captivated under the cover of education. if allowed to go unpunished, this might lead to criminal offences in future. view the page international
