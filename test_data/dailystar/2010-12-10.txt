the colliding trains in narsingdi
the head-on collision of two trains, the mahanagar godhuli and chattala express, in narsingdi on wednesday raises the question of how safe railway services are in bangladesh. there is a particular reason why such a question comes up, given that the general feeling has been that compared to other means of public travel, such as bus and launch services, railway journeys have been looked upon as relatively secure. the accident rate in the case of the railways is lower than that in the case of bus and launch journeys. but, of course, we do realise that accidents do happen all the time and in every area. the idea remains, though, that there ought to be as few of them as possible.
saving electricity important
at a moment that the country is facing a crisis of energy and power, it is needless to emphasise that the issue of controlling wastage of power should be one of our main concerns. in this perspective, introduction of the 'national electricity week' which is being observed since december 7 marks the date of commemoration of dhaka's getting its first power connection about a century and a decade ago (1901). this is undoubtedly a very inspiring idea. but the quality of being novel and at the same time inspiring is one thing, while getting the people habituated to saving electricity is another. view the page sports

long-standing problems
our country is faced with three grave and chronic problems:
parking spaces needed
we know that the increased number of vehicles on the roads of the capital is the reason behind severe traffic jam. but parking problem is also a reason that should not be ignored. the vehicles cannot run smoothly on the roads, because the parked vehicles occupy a part of the roads. vehicles are parked on the roads because no designated car-parking spaces are available for them in the city. when various organisations build markets, houses and offices, they forget to set aside car parking spaces! so, people are compelled to park their vehicles on the roads obstructing vehicle movement, which causes severe traffic jam.
trade wars
despite sustained denials by the pentagon, the leaked cables from wikileaks confirm that u.s. military special operations forces have been secretly working with the pakistani military to conduct offensive operations and coordinate drone strikes in the areas near the afghan border.
good programmes on television
i agree with the tone of the letter of sakhawat samir choudhury (29th november). finding good programmes on television is, indeed, difficult moreover, it is perfectly natural to fear that the content of many programmes - and the advertising! - is brainwashing not only the young, but all of us with bad standards and values.
a spectacular sight

al - bnp confrontation
the major parties, al and bnp are sworn enemies; and except for the common platform to remove ershad from the seat of power, these two parties have been at loggerheads at all times. their behaviour with each other is unlike major oppositions in many democracies in the world.
deaths in custody
the recent death of a teenager in police custody has marred the already damaged reputation of our law enforcers. it has been alleged that some officials have demanded bribe in exchange of the release of the youth. the police officials claimed that he was a 'suspected' mugger and was caught with several of his accomplices. what happened next is hard to believe. the court sent the underage 'suspected' mugger on a two-day remand! after two days, the teen ended up in the hospital dead.
musa ibrahim
i work at nokia in finland where my office is like a mini united nations with people from around the world. many, if not all, are snow and skiing aficionados and mount everest conquerors like musa ibrahim are hailed as heroes. when musa conquered the majestic mountain, interest in musa and bangladesh in general rose to a new peak in the office and i was very proud. everyone had seen and read about him in the media and turned to me for more information.

the norad response came late
yippie! norad has spoken at last. last wednesday, late in the afternoon bangladesh time, it released a statement that should clear the smog of doubts hanging over grameen bank and muhammad yunus. the norwegian aid agency has confirmed that there was no embezzlement done by the poor man's banker and his bank, although grameen bank did transfer norwegian fund to grameen kallyan, “breaching agreement.”
cutting off the nose
cutting off the nose to spite the face is an age old adage to describe an action out of pique. albeit metaphorical, this defines a desperate act that would damage oneself more than the source of one's anger. i do not know why, but i am attracted to this proverb by the surreal controversy raised at the highest level of our country over an unproven charge of funds embezzlement against an individual who is an icon of pride and achievement for a nation otherwise known for poverty. truly, i find no answer for this behavior among us unless we accept another expression that some people run after a kite to retrieve a headgear without checking their heads first.
thoughts on human rights
human rights day once again! the declaration of human rights has been translated in about 400 languages. but the mandate has not been translated into action! the situation remains bleak all over the world. the picture with regard to the millennium development goal is brighter, not bright. this speaks a great deal about the sad state of the first ever universal document on human rights. the theme for this year is "human rights defenders who act to end discrimination." this year, one aim is to emphasise the primary responsibility of the governments to enable and protect the role of those who work for human rights.
the wayward city
i keep guessing how many people there are on the teeming roads of dhaka. not those on the cranky buses, slithering three wheelers, the most carefree rickshaws and the sleek cars, but the pedestrians streaming in any direction of their choice and the hawkers defiantly settled on the footpaths and spilling over into the roads with their merchandise, chanting their marketing hymns and describing the aphrodisiac potency in sensuous details. surely, the numbers are bewildering.
in praise of the law
it doesn't take a genius to understand the law, but you do have to be smart. some might call the law a whole set of common sense statements, including a whole spate of things ranging from pronouncements to dictums, accumulated over a span of centuries. that is the case with the english common law that we follow in this country, and that is why many of our lawyers travel to the uk to attain the professional law certification to practice english law, something that i too have done, and become a bar-at-law, or the more respectable appellation barrister-at-law, most commonly known as "barrister." view the page startech
