'crossfire' killings are unacceptable
the latest round of bbc shonglap, as reported in the media, has thrown up some rather interesting as well as intriguing observations. on the one hand, participants on the show as well as part of the audience would like the enactment of a new law to improve law and order rather than a continuation of 'crossfire' methods to dispose of 'criminals.' on the other (and this is where the intriguing bit comes in), there are individuals who seemingly believe that 'crossfires' are an effective way of restoring law and order and ensuring security for citizens. it is this second aspect of the bbc-sponsored dialogue which causes concern. one of the prime reasons behind the voicing of such concerns stems from the views aired by shipping minister shahjahan khan at the dialogue. in his opinion, conventional ways of dealing with criminals have not worked and only 'crossfires' can lead to a restoration of security for people.

erratic share market
the volume and number of transactions in the market of stock exchange is the barometer of the economy of a modern country. although we are a developing country we have two houses ( dhaka and chittagong ) and we see an increasing trend of the people towards this 'paper' market.
population boom
population of bangladesh stands at more than 162 million at present. the country is already bursting at the seams. there is a news item in the daily star that there will be crisis of the basic tools for population control like condoms, oral pills (ocp), injectable contraceptives etc. in the very near future. it is alarming news, and warrants immediate intervention by the government and the donor agencies.
mahatma gandhi's message
re: "mahatma gandhi" by ashikur rahman (sept. 30).
sugar price
sugar price hike is caused by two very simple reasons. first, we are a heavily sugar-deficit nation. secondly, the second biggest exporter of the sweetener in the international market, india, has suffered crop-failure this year resulting in less production of sugar and ban on export sale. meanwhile, in global market sugar price has risen quite sharply. we know in market-economy price of a commodity is solely determined on demand-supply formula, no amount of moral persuasion or punitive threat can hold the pattern in check.

raped girl
nupur, a poor girl, was raped recently in a village in shariatpur district..
taxation rigmarole
needless to say that tax, vat and levy are essential economic factors in the running and development of a nation. however, this indispensable source of economic contribution declines through tax evasions on account of the complicated procedures. apart from aforesaid rationale other causes of non-compliance are lack of awareness, officials' harassments, complicated law, reluctance to disclose income and assets, venal tax officials, nepotism, high compliance cost and political pressure and so forth. tax accounts for 80% of the revenue receipts while remaining 20% is derived from other sources. there are very few citizens who pay their income tax to the government while most of us are evading it due to mainly complicated and inconvenient process, lack of awareness and lack of stringent actions against tax evaders. let us come to the main point: our prime minister has pledged to digitalize bangladesh by 2021 which needs not only the governments' honest all out efforts but also the assistance of its citizens to make the dream come true. there is no doubt that economic strength is the number one requirement to see bangladesh as a digital nation. if the figure of tax evaders keeps growing, then it will remain a dream forever.
scarcity of books
the library facilities on the rajshahi campus of aub are not satisfactory. and the reading room inside the library is not spacious. but when the students are admitted here they are informed by the authorities that course materials will be given by them. but many books, especially english texts, are not available in the library. as a result, in every semester the students of english department are bound to buy a lot of books. these books are very costly.
students and terror
according to the definition of oxford dictionary "terrorism" means 'the use of violent action in order to achieve political aims or to force a government to act'. as per the extroversion of international law, there are different tyres of terrorism viz. international terrorism, national terrorism, communal terrorism, racial terrorism and so forth. but we cannot find any place for “student terrorism” in international law.
drug abuse
drug addiction is increasing at an alarming rate in our country. like all other problems, this problem also has a solution. many developed and developing countries are adopting those ways but in our country, there are no special effects of those steps. we are facing difficulties to solve this problem because of the scarcity of caring drug rehabilitation centers (drc). though we have a small number of drcs, they are not trained enough to manage drug addiction.
bsmmu scene
ten professors and an associate professor of different departments of bangabandhu sheikh mujib medical university (bsmmu), were dismissed for their alleged political affiliation. the registrar of the university said that the decision was taken by the bsmmu syndicate.
role of smes
smes are the driving force behind any growing economy like bangladesh. when the country is suffering from scarcity of investment, the smes are showing great enthusiasm to invest more, though they are facing hurdles due to the fact that the commercial banks and non-bank financial institutions (nbfis) charge high interest rate on loans.
prospects of tourism sector
tourism in bangladesh is a slowly developing foreign currency earner. the country has much to attract international and domestic tourists.
talk shows galore
there is a good saying for a man to be a good person --"hear no evil, speak no evil and see no evil". if we hear no evil, we will be happy, if we speak no evil, we will not harm others and if we see no evil, we will be in peace. in bangladesh almost every hour of the day there are talk shows in private tv channels, sometimes simultaneously. whenever, we tune to a bangladeshi channel, we find a talk show going on. the viewers feel the private channels have no other programmes except ads and talk shows to keep their channels running. we believe, the channel authorities bring in participants from "shushil shomaj" who are experienced, high profile politicians or former high officials.
birth anniversary of pm
the nation in general and the awami league and its front organisations in particular celebrated birth anniversary of prime minister sheikh hasina with due fanfare and enthusiasm. but we are yet to know the actual number of her birth anniversary this year. different tv channels observed her 63rd birth anniversary through news telecast, while the daily star in its 28th september, 2009 issue mentioned it as 62nd birth anniversary. view the page international
