radical shift in stem cell research
ishika's daughter has heart disease, synthia's husband schizophrenia. rifat's neighbor has parkinson's, martin's nephew is traumatized. proper treatment of these life-threatening diseases is subject to extensive medical research. on top of the existing medications to alleviate the conditions, permanent solutions for them are called-for. stem cell research had long been thought as a potential tool to provide a permanent solution to these diseases. however, medical-research insiders now know that embryonic stem (es) cell technology is proving to be a dead end. the alternatives could be adult stem (as) cells which are far more controllable than the es cells, because although es cells have the capacity to differentiate into many types of cells, they face the pitfall of developing uncontrolled cell division phenomenon leading to cancer and also ethical debate of killing human life taking conception as the start of a new life. in contrast to es cells, which are regarded totiopotent, that is, capable of developing into any cell type found in adult organism, the types of stem cells found in adults are either unipotent, (stem cells capable of developing into a single specialized cell type), or pluripotent, stem cells capable of developing into a few closely related cell types. so, the question arose, would it be possible to find out an alternative source of totiopotent or at least totiopotent-like stem cells?

why is mercury forgotten planet?
mercury can claim the title for the "weirdest" planet in the solar system, apart from being the smallest and the innermost. it has the wildest temperature extremes - from 800'c to to 300'c and drifts from being the nearest to being the farthest from the sun. reaching mercury poses significant challenges as the planet orbits close to the sun. hence, it is regarded as the forgotten planet in the solar system.
