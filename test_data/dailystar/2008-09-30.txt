eid-ul-fitr reinforces hope for better future
eid-ul-fitr comes once again with its message of remembrance of the almighty and caring for those who are less privileged than us. with the end of the holy month of ramadan, it becomes our particular responsibility to go for self-assessment on what we have endeavoured to do during the period and what we could yet have done to bind our spirit with the higher calling of faith. ramadan is a testing time for all muslims. in this month, it is questions of how we have fared as a society, of how the gap between rich and poor keeps us pinioned to disappointment that we deal with. ramadan is also a reminder that islam is a religion of peace and abjures all forms of extremism. exploitation of faith for the purpose of attaining ulterior motives is an idea abhorrent to islam. ramadan is also a message about the higher moral quality we need to bring to life and a necessary lesson that life lived on earth is but a preparation for the world hereafter.

eid-ul-fitr
eid" in arabic means "joy" and fitr means "return to normalcy." eid-ul-fitr in is celebrated in the muslim world as a day of joy and happiness, fun and frolic, pleasure and gaiety. but it was an eid-ul-fitr and yet the great caliph omar bin khattab (ra) -- the man whose "walking stick," in the words of emerson, "struck more terror into those who saw it than another man's sword," -- was weeping and trembling like a lamb ready for slaughter.
