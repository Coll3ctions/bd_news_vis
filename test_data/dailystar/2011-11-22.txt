rice that was, and that is
it is nostalgia which rises in the soul when you think back on an era that is not to be again. time was when bangladesh was home to as many as 7,500 varieties of rice, proof of which comes through the preservation of these varieties at the bangladesh rice research institute as also at the gene bank of the international rice research institute (irri) in the philippines. to put it more simply, these varieties of our staple food, known by their poetically fragrant names of banshphul, laxmibilash, dudhbinni, radhakrishna, chinisagar and many others, are, for the most part, exhibits that hark back to a more glorious time in our history. but time, again, has its own ways of dealing with nature, indeed with life itself.

prevention of hiv/aids
we should feel happy that the prevalence of hiv/aids in bangladesh is much less than that of other countries, even some around us. but that does in no way allow us to bask in complacency because like it or not, in spite of the religious and social mores that exercise certain restraint on people's behaviour in our country, existence of other causative factors makes most people above a certain age potentially susceptible to the disease.
corporal punishment in schools
the case of a teacher indiscriminately beating 37 students of class 6 at a school in rampura is appalling. while this particular case has made headlines, corporal punishment remains a common practice at schools and madrasahs in bangladesh, with hundreds of students being subjected to it every year. this is despite a high court ban on corporal punishment at educational institutions last year and a rule earlier this year declaring corporal punishment as constituting a clear violation of children's fundamental rights to life, liberty and freedom from cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. the hc last year also asked the government to show cause why its failure to prevent such incidents -- including through the framing of laws and guidelines; investigate such allegations; and prosecute and punish the perpetrators, should not be deemed a violation of rights guaranteed under the constitution. view the page sports

earth's extreme extinction
it's well known that earth's most severe mass extinction occurred about 250 million years ago. what's not well known is the specific time when the extinctions occurred. a team of researchers from north america and china have published a paper in science which explicitly provides the date and rate of extinction.
translating aristotle
of the writings endorsed to aristotle (384-322 bc), the polished essays and dialogues which he intended for publication have been almost completely lost, with the exception of a few fragments. the great body of aristotle's thought that has come down to us is in the form of "treatise" on various subjects, such as logic, physics, ethics, psychology, biology, and politics. it seems that these treatise began as notes on (or summaries of) aristotle's lectures at the lyceum in athens. he continued to edit and revise them throughout his life, as his views evolved, but never brought them to a state of completion for publication. subsequently they were edited and organized into "books" by his students, and then the whole corpus was transmitted through a series of transcribers, translators, and commentators.

plastic isn't over yet

who invented submarine?
leonardo da vinci (1452-1519) made sketches of a submarine and william bourne, a british mathematician, drew plans for a submarine in 1578. but it was only in 1620 that cornelius van drebbel, a dutch inventor, managed to build a submarine. he wrapped a wooden rowboat tightly in waterproofed leather and had air tubes with floats to the surface to provide oxygen. of course, there were no engines yet, so the oars went through the hull at leather gaskets. he took the first trip with 12 oarsmen in the thames river staying submerged for 3 hours.
