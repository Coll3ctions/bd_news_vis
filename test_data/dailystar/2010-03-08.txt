achieving equal rights
the world is celebrating 100 years of international women's day today, with the theme "equal rights, equal opportunities: progress for all." the positive changes that occurred over the last two centuries all over the world for women in the areas of education, employment, rights and in politics, did not happen spontaneously. generations of women came together and caused these changes to take place. the achievement is not only women's right for education and employment but also to be part of all levels of government and to serve the nation.
stand up for yourselves
i congratulate all the women of our country and the world on the 100th year of international women's day. in 1869, british member of parliament john stuart mill was the first person to call for women's right to vote. on september 19, 1893 new zealand became the first country in the world to give women the right to vote. women in other countries did not enjoy this equality and campaigned for justice for many years.
it happened
it wasn't because of amusement, distraction, attention or even excitement. it happened because it happens everyday, in our minds, in our thoughts, when we walk down streets, buy flowers from little girls in the corners, afternoon sun glistens off our bodies, evening air wants us to speak out, under our showers when we wash off the day we want to scream out words we have locked up inside for hours, days, months, years. it happened because all the expressions built inside had to come out one by one so that they can be celebrated, they are your stories you see? yours and mine.
