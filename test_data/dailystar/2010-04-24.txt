of distorted and derailed investigation
this scribe for quite some time has been venturing, apparently unsuccessfully, to impress upon the prime necessity of conducting credible and unbiased criminal investigation of all cases, particularly the nationally significant ones. as such, the daily star 's editorial premonition (april 16) about the lack of desirable progress in the ramna batamul blast case and other such incidents came as a vindication of the public concern of the unsatisfactory state of affairs in this regard.

urban poverty and environmental degradation: vicious cycle
green' issues are spearheading discussions on resource management, biodiversity and global warming, while the environmental problems known as 'brown agenda' have been neglected for a long time. challenges in addressing and meeting the brown agenda in the cities have acquired prominence among the planning and development professionals around the world. it is well accepted that rapid urbanisation has aggravated problems like sanitation and drainage, solid waste management, degradation of soil and land, uncontrolled emissions from the domestic and industrial activities, street and abode congestions and improper disposal of hazardous waste resulting in poor health of people. cities and towns have been hubs of economic development but how this economic development must be achieved in the first place? do the rapid industrialisation, urbanisation and development of communication network add impetus to economic development at the cost of environment?

writers who borrowed from shakespeare
charles dickens, thomas hardy, somerset maugham, tom stoppard, john steinbeck, aldous huxley, william faulkner, pearl s. buck, agatha christie and many other famous writers have used phrases from shakespeare as titles for their works. many writers throughout the world have been greatly influenced by the works of shakespeare, and as a result, they have quoted him, particularly in the titles they have chosen. “i am not only witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other men” --- falstaff's comment is a clue to knowing that shakespeare's wit inspired others to write and the titles derived from his works reemphasize his greatness over all other writers.
shakespeare was for all time
william shakespeare is the most famous english dramatist and poet. his contemporary and rival playwright ben jonson wrote about him thus: “he was not of an age, but for all time.” stephen greenblatt, the editor of the norton shakespeare, writes, “indeed, so absolute is shakespeare's achievement that he has himself come to seem like great creating nature: the common bond of humankind.”
the legacy of shakespeare
mathew arnold paid the highest tribute to shakespeare when he said in “to shakespeare”, “others abide our question. thou art free.” arnold's absolution of shakespeare gives us a measure of the immense influence the elizabethan bard wields centuries after his death. again shakespeare's unquestionable authority is reinforced when a.b. aldrich heralds in 'king william': “yet 'twas the king of england's kings /the rest with all their pomps and trains / are mouldered, half-remembered things---/'tis he alone that lives and reigns!”

when do we need scaling and polishing?
our teeth become stained over time due to various food and also bacterial action. other than stains, calculus (stones) develops due to food debris in the mouth and the build-up of calculus can cause gum swelling and infection. scaling is done to remove calculus while polishing is to clean stains on tooth. this procedure helps keep the gum-tooth interface clean and healthy thus reducing the possibility of gum disease, swelling and bleeding.

how to govern a nation, briefly . . .
running a government, even if it is an interim one, is serious business. and writing about it is a good deal more, which is probably why not many who have had the chance of administering a government have generally opted to stay silent. in bangladesh, where, constitutionally-ordained caretaker administrations have been the norm in pre-election times since 1990, justice shahabuddin ahmed has clearly not been tempted to recount his experiences as head of the caretaker government following the fall of the ershad regime in december 1990. but, yes, justice latifur rahman, on whose watch the bangladesh nationalist party-jamaat e islami combine triumphed at the october 2001 elections, did have his own story to relate. it did not make much of an impression. as for the future, one will simply need to wait for fakhruddin ahmed to enlighten the nation on the tumultuous times during which he presided over a return to parliamentary government in late 2008. maybe he will come forth with his observations. maybe he will not. it all depends.
taking a peek into a lost era
professor mozaffar hossain, though not a very well acquainted literary figure, has been contributing enormously to the liberal arts in the last decade. a teacher of philosophy, mozaffar hossain's most praiseworthy book has been aro koyekjon socrates that was published in 2008. before that his translation from english into the bangla of marxism and poetry by george thomson, the mayor of casterbridge by thomas hardy and islam by alfred guillaume drew attention of a good part of the literati of the country. his recent book pata ultai, an autobiographical work in nature, is also worth mentioning as a significant work.
light in the dark
spark of light in poverty alleviation and rural development for a quarter century is actually a research report composed by two eminent faculty members of sher-e-bangla agricultural university (sau), dhaka, prof. mohammad hossain bhuiyan and associate prof. dr. md. sekender ali and published on the occasion of 25 years of dipshikha, an international non-formal education, training, and research society for village development. the book contains data-based information with research findings and interpretations about the development activities rendered by dipshikha during its 25 years of dedicated service to its client system, donor agencies and development workers. in 1984, dipshikha took birth as a silent social movement from grassroots level initiated by some self-driven and self-motivated non-elites who ranged from school teachers to local leaders. since its inception dipshikha has been working with the least educated downtrodden people in the field of agriculture, education, health and sanitation, human rights and good governance and has succeeded in attaining significant achievement in the sector of socio-economic development in bangladesh and elsewhere.
