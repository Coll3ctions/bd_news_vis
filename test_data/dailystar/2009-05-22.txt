agriculture and farmers
considering its huge population, bangladesh is a very tiny country. cyclone and other natural calamities prone bangladesh is undoubtedly dependent on agriculture and its farmers. but it is a matter of concern that every year our country is losing 1% of its agricultural land due to increasing housing and other development purposes.
unemployment problem
nowhere in the world is this problem so acute as in our country. thousands of people in this country are now without any job. the bad effect of unemployment is not only confined to the economic field but it also destroys the moral fabric of society.

save ashulia
ashulia lake is a nice place. people love to go there with their friends and families. city dwellers yearn for a place where they can enjoy natural beauty.
death of workers
nowadays, going abroad to work is not a blessing, rather a death trap. every day, we find the death news of migrant workers from abroad. a survey has been made by two or three newspapers that 912 dead bodies have reached the country in recent months. it is alarming news.
queen elizabeth's birthday
“the daily star” in its 14 may issue carried a special supplement marking the birthday of her majesty queen elizabeth ii.
build an overbridge
all of we know that old dhaka is extremely crowded with several types of vehicles. most of the vehicles are not in good shape, sometimes drivers cannot control their vehicles, leading to accidents. to overcome it, the authorities should construct overbridges on busy roads, like tikatuli area just near the rajdhani market. it is quite a busy road, without any speed-breakers.
market manipulators
recently, the same business group responsible for the 1996 dhaka stock market collapse has become very active in the market causing serious concerns for many, particularly small investors. they are trying to take advantage of their close relation with the policy makers by declaring higher dividends for market manipulation. they are so clever in their accounting and finance practices, that our weak sec or regulatory bodies are helpless.
future of acc
it is reported in the newspapers that some powers of anti-corruption commission (acc) are being curtailed and the prime minister is being given the veto power to block or allow any case for prosecution by the acc. this was an old rule which was abolished during the 4-party alliance government. there were reports of widespread misuse by the absolute power until 1/11, and the common people could know about the existence of the acc only after this change. the "picked-men-select" theory was the rule. the findings of corruption cases during the ctg have in fact opened the public eyes. the people could only know that their country had become champion as the "most corrupt nation" in the world but they did not know the scale of corruption that could happen before that time.
cleanliness
clean living is the reflection of a clean society. and for a clean lifestyle we have to do away with all kinds of dirt, muck, filth, mess, stain and dampness from our society. today a rickshaw-puller gave me a dirty ten taka note change which not only mentally let me down but also caused me trouble in passing it to others as everybody wants crispy clean notes for crispy feelings. but mere wishing will not help. we have to work with the government to create a civilized society. for cleaning all ills from society, first we have to start working for cleanliness which may involve cleaning filth, dust and dampness off all our private and public infrastructures and withdrawing all slimy and tattered notes from the market. once the environment is clean and hygienic, people will automatically get rid of narrow-mindedness, greediness etc.
pay hike
recently, the pay commission submitted its report to the finance ministry with recommendation to increase the salary of government employees by 82% on an average. the recommended highest salary is tk.45,000 (fixed) and the lowest basic salary is tk.4,000. other recommendations are: govt. staff will pay income taxes, education allowance for two children & retirement age extended to 60 years.
jmb menace
the speed with which jmb is spreading its evil roots in our country is really disquieting. bangladesh being a poor country is more vulnerable to the proliferation of these obscurantists who recruit the poor religious minded people to serve their interests. though islam strictly prohibits terrorism or militancy and disseminates the message of peace, these poor people are given wrong interpretation of 'jihad' with well-manoeuvred skills of oratory. they are paid regularly and trained well for different units e.g. bomb-making or suicide squads to establish their version of the state and that by killing people!
thanks, minister
recently, our education minister declared that this government would form a separate pay commission for the teacher community of bangladesh. we don't know what will he, personally, be able to do for this derelict community, but this is enough for getting thanks as he has given his plan. we can anticipate such type of consideration from him because he has an extensive background of working with 'education' in bangladesh. generally, our political leaders like to remain far from this sector because this is comparatively less profitable in the business of politics. but till now he is working and this comments prove that he has feelings for this 'backward' group of people.
nuclear power
in a bid to reduce the present energy crisis the government has signed mou with russia for setting up a nuclear energy project in ruppur. similar mous were also singed with the usa & china prior to that. going by the present activities, it is evident that the government is determined to set up a nuclear energy project. my concern is, can bangladesh handle a project like that considering its high risk factors, radioactive waste management, technical know-how and last, but not the least, fund sourcing?
