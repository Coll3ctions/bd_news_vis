pigs are horses, girls are boys, war is peace
as arundhati roy refuses to be known as a 'writer-activist' only because she has been writing political essays since she won the booker prize in 1997 for her debut novel, the god of small things, a formidable writer emerges with an awesome repertoire of ideas, words that are her powerful arsenal and logic that is absolutely irrefutable. to her the term 'writer-activist' is despicable and brings to her mind an image of the 'sofa-bed' which primarily is a sofa, however much it may be transformed into a bed. in the same way, a writer remains fundamentally a writer whether s/he chooses to write fiction or non-fiction, she argues. she moreover reminds us that although her first book is a work of fiction, nevertheless it is no less political than any of her essays. and exactly this is the point that has been missed by some of us.
yet another political history and an afterthought
political history is fascinating because it offers an insight into the genesis of political institutionalization, or the failure to do so, in any particular country. political history, not infrequently, is a bone of contention because that insight might, and often does, take the form of diverse interpretations, which might only partially agree, or be at significant variance, with one another. the fact remains that bangladesh emerged as a sovereign independent nation-state from the province of east bengal, which was subsequently renamed east pakistan. the fact also remains that the interpretation in the context of this emergence is often as diverse as the authors offering the explanation, and is inevitably influenced by new information coming to light. therefore, any new work on political history will, in all probability, not be the final word on the subject, especially since new evidence regarding the emergence will continue to materialize for the foreseeable future.
