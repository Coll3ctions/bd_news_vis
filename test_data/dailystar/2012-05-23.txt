misuse of water resources
there is little doubt in the public mind of the need to do something on the constant attack by unscrupulous business interests on constricting, redirecting and filling up of public water bodies, rivers and canals for profit. in an effort to halt such malpractices, the cabinet has approved a draft bill bangladesh water act, 2012 that promises to put in place a series of checks and balances aimed at halting misuse of said resources. while it is commendable to see that the government has finally taken heed of decades of outcry by affected communities, environmentalists and water experts, it will be interesting to see whether the stringent provisions proposed in the act, such as, five years' imprisonment or a fine of tk. 5 million will actually be enforced with due diligence in reality. reasons for disruption of natural flow of water and pollution are well known, but we often overlook the disastrous effects such wilful trespassing have on the natural state of affairs. whether it is pollution or obstruction of natural flow of water, there is no denying that manmade interventions have helped bring about ecological disaster to entire communities of people who depend on these water resources for their livelihoods. view the page sports

lionel messi, a philanthropist footballer
messi has won the heart of millions by his football magic. he has been nominated best footballer of the year by the fifa three times at a stretch and has pocketed a lot of other international records. my respect and support for messi increased when he extended his helping hands for saving the life of walid kasas, a young footballer of morocco. kasas, a twelve-year-old boy, is suffering from a kind of hormonal problem which requires a long term and expensive treatment. a relative of kasas then made an appeal to messi for financial help to save the helpless boy. messi readily agreed and declared that he would bear the expenditure of his treatment for the next six years so that kasas can bounce back. it is interesting to note that this great footballer messi was also suffering from the same disease in his boyhood. it is fabulous that overcoming this physical hurdle he has become the world's best footballer. may be kasas would also be a great footballer like messi in the future. however, the philanthropic response of messi has drawn our attention. other celebrities and rich people can also learn this great virtue from him and extend their helping hands for humanity. my heartfelt wishes for him. i also pray for kasas' quick recovery.
