misuse of water resources
there is little doubt in the public mind of the need to do something on the constant attack by unscrupulous business interests on constricting, redirecting and filling up of public water bodies, rivers and canals for profit. in an effort to halt such malpractices, the cabinet has approved a draft bill bangladesh water act, 2012 that promises to put in place a series of checks and balances aimed at halting misuse of said resources. while it is commendable to see that the government has finally taken heed of decades of outcry by affected communities, environmentalists and water experts, it will be interesting to see whether the stringent provisions proposed in the act, such as, five years' imprisonment or a fine of tk. 5 million will actually be enforced with due diligence in reality. reasons for disruption of natural flow of water and pollution are well known, but we often overlook the disastrous effects such wilful trespassing have on the natural state of affairs. whether it is pollution or obstruction of natural flow of water, there is no denying that manmade interventions have helped bring about ecological disaster to entire communities of people who depend on these water resources for their livelihoods. view the page sports
