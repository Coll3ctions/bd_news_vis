fresh violence at dhaka university
the death of a student of dhaka university following a fresh spate of violence on the campus only reinforces the case for tough action toward restoring discipline in academia. only a few days ago we had commented on the growing tendency of students towards violence and asked the authorities to do everything that needed to be done to roll back this slide to disorder. unfortunately, the slide has continued, as demonstrated by the violence at du and at institutions like dhaka college, where the simple process of admission has become hostage at the hands of student politics. it is our considered opinion that unless drastic and foolproof steps are taken to restore a normal academic atmosphere on the campuses, things may spiral out of control and leave citizens helpless in the face of it all.
citizens' monitoring of public procurement
the planning minister's frank admission that graft gobbles up 40 to 50 per cent of the public funds allocated against any procurement contract only confirms the public perception on the issue. since public procurement involves about 70 per cent of the expenditures under the annual development programme (adp), the amount of money involved in it is also huge. naturally, unless the rules of procurement are strict and foolproof, one should not be too surprised if a significant sum of the money leaks through into corrupt hands.

global warming and weather
this winter, most countries have had cold waves and harsher winters. also, the ice in himalayan and alps mountain range and high mountains in north america and canada have melted faster than normal. similarly, there has been considerable melting of ice in the artic and antarctic regions. sea passages in the artic and antarctic oceans are now open for navigation, because of this accelerated melting of ice. cargo sea vessels from the north german port of hamburg are now safely sailing through the north west passage, to canada and north us ports, which earlier remained ice bound at this time of the year! this apparent anomaly of the weather may be explained by basic principles of physics.
women's seats in buses

employ beggars
i believe that the government could employ beggars and have them clean up the city. they could collect as many plastic bags and as much trash as possible and turn them in for food, cash or both, depending upon how much rubbish they turn in. this will also keep them busy and do something useful rather than being a menace to motorists on the roads and endangering traffic. there are many beggars, especially women who are not physically disabled, and it's about time they all started doing something useful instead of begging!
is it true?
i was quite shocked to hear a news report . this was given in a channel i newspaper review programme by mr mr chaoudhury. the reaction of a senior journalist was quite legitimate and necessary. the news report is that a bwdb project from the "aila" affected area has been moved from there to bhairab. the news is missing a lot of details, yet i think the reaction of the journalist was quite appropriate.
police clearance for visa
indians need police clearance for saudi visas. at present the indians, who are applying for passport have to get a police clearance certificate in order to get it. the validity of most of the passports is 10 years and during this period a person may commit a crime. it is a good decision to insist upon the certificate for employment visa. this will end the suspicions and will stop the person with criminal records from coming to saudi arabia. however, on the negative side the police department will have to work harder and the normal 4-5 week clearance period will be further delayed.
railway land
as a son of a railway employee, i have been witnessing the encroachment of railway land since my childhood. a vast area of railway all over chittagong is now under the clutches of the greedy occupants. the range of occupants varies from poor slum dwellers and refugees to powerful bigwigs and government bodies. in my childhood it was a common sight for us to see houses and other establishments being bulldozed and overthrown in an attempt to recover railway land and re-encroachment of the land soon afterwards. again, there were, and still are, certain establishments which belonged to the so-called big guns which had always been exempted. the railway is now almost crippled due the massive corruption on the part of its employees to high officials.
“i did not read it”

great advice
once one of the companions of our greatest and dearest rasul hazrat muhammad (pbuh) said to the rasul, ''ya rasulallah! teach me such an act by which i will be able to gain love of both allah and humans.'' our dearest prophet muhammad (pbuh) advised him, ''if you can give up your greed for things belonging to others, people will love you. and, if you can give up your earthly hopes, allah will love you.''
lost harmony
i remembered the time when our small, quaint area was being urbanized. lots of cutting down of trees and dust cloud may be the approved definition for urbanization but to me it is something different. it made the area arid and the harmony with the nature is lost. once there were many charming songs of parrots and magpie robins. now i can hardly see birds, except for crows dominating with their harsh noise.
duty free cars
the last caretaker government had done one good thing it abolished the unjust privilege of the lawmakers of importing duty free cars. i am greatly distressed to see the vile practice being revived again. our perception is that nobody in our country is ever poorer after entering politics. in most cases the aspirants to the jatiyo sangsad spend several millions just to get party nomination.
progoti industries
the progoti industries is an industrial enterprise that belongs to bangladesh steel and engineering corporation (bsec). it assembles motor vehicles. a bangla daily newspaper from dhaka reported recently that it had been suffering from acute working capital shortage. it borrowed inadequate working capital form commercial banks with high interest.
a good system
bangladesh has been experimenting with different forms of government since independence without any remarkable achievement. none of the systems has been able to deliver what this country requires. to achieve any tangible success bangladesh needs to switch over to a failure-proof time tested system. the system that is in vogue in the united states has made america the number one country in the world. this system of governance ensures accountability and responsible leadership.
misuse of corporate culture
like any other thing, bangladeshi traditional work-culture doesn't adopt the western practice of the 'corporate culture' without terrible deformation. while in the west, this working pattern maintains clarity, equality and system, in bangladesh it fuels up the manipulation of the surplus labour force. over the last decade, we have seen a change in the overall working condition of bangladesh. this change, in its turn, is moulding the socio-cultural fabric of our society. both my parents were service-holders; however, when we were younger, we found both of them returning home before four o'clock. consequently, the family did not face the disorientation of loneliness and boredom. but in our present time, most of the corporate offices, banks and even the education institutions have very long working-hours, the minimum of which is perhaps no less then eight -hours. now the point is, some of the banks and offices even make the workers work till late-nights. and the academics return home with the overwhelming workload in the form of preparing questions, checking the scripts. they are not spared. when these people return home, after a day long of exhaustion (adding the never ending traffic-jam), they are, no doubt, not in a mood to spend time with the children and other family members. and without creating enough child-care provision for the small and school-going children, we demand married women to work and maintain a family life. all these exploitation of labour should be brought under control.
