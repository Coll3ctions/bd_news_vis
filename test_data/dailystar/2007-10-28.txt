chittagong's sad tale
do we really understand the meaning of equality and human rights? if we do, then why are the people of chittagong facing the danger of being washed away and thrown into the drains, or falling into manhole and being lost forever during a heavy shower? the reason is lack of proper drainage system. the very well known 'chaktai khal'and a number of other less known khals have been occupied, of course illegally and filled up by sand coming down from the innumerable hills cut down by land grabbers. so long we have been living in a fool's paradise. every year during the rainy season we hear that a sizeable fund has been made available and very soon the 'chaktai khal' will be dredged and the drains from all around the city leading to the 'khal' cleared, which will stop water logging in the city. alas! nothing has been done and the situation has gone from bad to worse. main areas of the city go under water and the ground floor of houses and shops are inundated.
