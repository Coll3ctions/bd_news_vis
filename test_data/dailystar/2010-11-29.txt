protecting and preserving lalbagh fort
the preservation of heritage is an important sign of how a nation takes pride in its history. that being the underlying truth, it is easy to understand the nature of the demand made the other day by the paribesh bachao andolon and bangladesh scouts dhaka district rover regarding measures toward protecting lalbagh fort. it is quite surprising that where the high court directive asking the authorities to ensure a preservation of the fort should have led to speedy and effective action, the demand by the two bodies only shows up once more the laid-back attitude so often adopted by the authorities over issues of public interest. there is no denying that over a long period of time, unauthorized constructions have appeared not only outside the fort, in its immediate vicinity, but inside the fort compound as well. how that has happened is a question which, we suspect, the authorities cannot answer to our satisfaction. all we know is that had the authorities been alert and carrying out their responsibilities, lalbagh fort would not be in the position it finds itself in today.

alter bridge comes back - darker, heavier, stronger
american rock act alter bridge unleashed their third studio production, ab iii, on october 10, in a somewhat break-out from what they are known for. to start with, ab iii could be loosely classified as a concept album, the most striking feature that separates it from it's last two albums one day remains and blackbird. the sound has certainly evolved from the last time you heard them, with more gallop and pounce. one of the most striking metamorphoses that you'll find in the band is if you put it on a scale against creed of 2004. the album is framed around a character "desperately struggling to find their place in a world steeped in doubt and emptiness," in contrary to the other two alter bridge records that focused on “hope and perseverance in the face of adversity." the band's frontman myles kennedy has said that the album "touches on the thoughts and emotions of someone who has come to question everything that was once regarded as an absolute truth" and that it is about "the realization that everything you once believed in might not exist." however, there are tracks in ab iii that touch on other emotions as well.

three women …
three women have lately been making quite a splash, separately and each in her distinctive way. there is the burmese democracy icon aung san suu kyi, whose political convictions and resilient nature have given her a niche that few can dream of attaining. she has just been freed from fifteen years of house arrest. but isn't it a little more than fifteen years? if you set aside the years 1988 and 1989, you will have an idea of how long and how bravely the daughter of aung san has suffered at the hands of a brutal military regime that has not flinched even from shooting protesting monks dead. suu kyi's huge electoral triumph in 1990, had it not been nullified by the junta, would by now have seen her country play a leading world as a democracy, an exercise that would have been of immense benefit to the neighbourhood. but that is of course a sad story.
