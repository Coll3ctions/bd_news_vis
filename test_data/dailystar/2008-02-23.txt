private airlines spreading wings
the national flag carrier, bangladesh biman, nose-diving through years of mismanagement and corruption, its reconstituted incarnation will take a long time in paying dividends. the market size of passengers, estimated to be around tk 3500 crore, is only touched on the fringes by our airlines. in this context, we are heartened to note that the private airlines of bangladesh are growing at par with the global aviation industry's annual growth rate of 7.6 percent. largely operating on the domestic routes with limited fleet strength, the 7-8 percent growth rate is quite a success story. imagine what it could be like if airlines of bangladesh origin could develop adequately to claim a greater share of the aviation market!

meeting our growing demand for energy

anxious time in pakistan
i do not rule out rigging in the pakistan election. my belief is that the seats the pakistan muslim league (quaid), the king's party, and the muttahida qaumi movement have won are far more than their hold or stock in the country suggests. the combined strength of the pakistan people's party (87) and the nawaz sharif's muslim league (66) is far less than their popularity. the two should have got two-thirds majority in the national assembly while they have secured 153.
food price-hike must be contained
at this moment all including professionals, intellectuals, elite, specialists have the same question on their lips: “will the prices of food stuff come down”. simultaneously all seek a consolation by referring to the fact that the present ctg has achieved a lot of successes, so it may be able to contain the price hike of foodstuff, too. the most common doctrine of economics is “when supply goes up in relation to demand, the price decreases and vice versa.” it is not necessary to become an economist to understand this doctrine. it may be mentioned that in mid 2006 the price of sugar was tk 65 per kg, but it came down to tk 25 per kg in the 1st quarter of 2007. it happened so because at that time despite hundreds of tons of sugar lying in the godowns of the local sugar mills, more sugar arrived from india through import or smuggling. this was clearly a game of demand and supply. i believe currently the price hike of foodstuff is also the same game though there may be some hoarding and profiteering motive, but that would be automatically eliminated if the supply goes up substantially. view the page sports

once political workers and those who struggled for freedom began to be captured after the first language movement of 1948, things continued pretty much the same way till 1971. once they put you away, there was no letting you out. only when big pushes were applied did prison doors open. like, for example, the big push of 21st february 1952, the push generated by the jugto front win of the general elections of '54, the ndf of '62, the shove of the 11 points of '69. and then at the beginning of the fight for freedom in 1971 many jail roads became wide city boulevards. during those first days time hung especially heavy. all those who were inside jails would think the whole earth was desolate. when would they awaken and rise, our students? noakhali's peasant leader momtaz miah was a village chairman, got hauled into prison on one of the very first sweeps. he would say, “get the boat on dry land, sailorman, now the tide's at ebb. when the tide's in, it'll lift the boar clear, it'll be that kind of a tide.

(the very first poem on ekushey - titled 'we are here not to weep' - is generally thought to have been written by mahbub-ul-alam chowdhury . it was written on that very day, in chittagong, at 7:00 p.m. - most probably as news of the police killings filtered through to the port city over the wires in that far less communicable time. for quite some time only fragments of the poem survived, and it was only later that the whole poem was found, and subsequently translated by professor kabir chowdhury. while today it may sound very dated - it is impossible to think that such a poem would be written now even if the oppression and the killings were to take place on our streets at present - readers should remember that it is very much a poem written in the heat of the moment, in pure anger and indignation, with multiple references to demands for revenge and hanging of the murderers, as well as reflecting the university culture of that time, with its references to aragon and einstein. it was a far more innocent time.)

between hope and despair
bangladesh has no option but democracy and democracy has no other option but the general election. why then the election, which was about to be held on january 22, 2007, was denied to the people for two long years? why did the people let out a sigh of relief when the designed election was stopped only ten days before the due date? it was a disaster aborted.
the lebanon crisis
lebanon is suffering from domestic political instability. at first it seems that this instability is a result of one side of the conflict, but in reality this conflict situation is related to the positions of the two sides, the sinioran government and the opposition headed by hezbollah. according to the constitution, the current government needs the support of two thirds of the members of parliament plus one in order to form a new government. the sinioran coalition and its associates, mainly jared eldan el hariri, realized that they could not convince two-thirds of the 124 members of parliament since they are trying to go against the constitution by forming a coalition led by hezbollah who currently are only 52 members of parliament. this effectively denies any chance of changing the constitution. however, as a compromise, hezbollah has agreed to appoint chief of staff general mechel suliman as the new president and an agreed upon government of national unity with 10 ministers from hezbollah, 10 ministers from the sinioran faction and 10 ministers who would be appointed by the new president. the sinioran government wants to exclude hezbollah and its christian ally led by general michel on. hezbollah's position is very solid in its rejection of any initiative that supports the sinioran hegemony over lebanon.

tired politicians, dead men and abducted women
it was a quixotic, wrenching break-up of a country that mountbatten and cyril radcliffe brought about in august 1947. there is little question that the last colonial viceroy was a man in a hurry, guided more by thoughts of his place in history than in the inevitability of the partition of india. and radcliffe, having never before set foot in the subcontinent, found it convenient to be ensconced in a room and slice through regions in the punjab and bengal he thought should fall to india or pakistan, as the case might be. the results were horrendous. villages were ruptured and even homes lay in pieces, with part in one country and part in another. just how uncertain and fraught with risks independence would turn out to be was made palpable in august when the chakmas of the chittagong hill tracts, happy in the belief that they were not to be part of muslim pakistan, hoisted the indian tricolour. they would be in for a rude shock. only hours later, they would find themselves herded into pakistan. their sufferings had only begun.

in the glare of the martinets
no one, except a cadet going off to join an alien institution, understands how it feels like going away at a very tender age. no one can imagine what a 12-year-old boy has to go through when he is sent off to a cadet college. no one but a cadet will understand what sort of man he becomes when he experiences all trials and tribulations, happiness and blues when he passes out of a cadet college to face life's real battles. no one, other than he himself, will understand the relationship with his comrades, who are products of the same cadet college.
a bizarre darkness
becoming a literary masterpiece is not this book's professed goals. this is supposed to be precisely what it claims to be: a diary written in a particular circumstance. but like all other good, clear and sincere writing, it transcends the mundane. in the process it turns itself into a compelling read, claiming the attention of anyone interested in knowing about a series of events that shook the nation beginning august 2007. this is a unique glimpse of a sensitive and unbending intellect looking at events from his own perspective, a perspective you can disagree with but cannot ignore.

essays on environment
jafar ahmed chowdhury
botomul
a good collection of essays is here from one who has been seriously involved with the issue. the writer has long been a government official, which position has enabled him to come in contact with matters that have particularly concerned bangladesh. there is a good chance the reader will find the essays stimulating. some of the frills could have been avoided, though.
