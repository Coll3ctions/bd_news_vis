two major religious books, namely, the holy quran and the bible , confirm that the conjugality of man and woman and the process of human procreation set in following the great union of adam and eve. later, as societies evolved and governments grew, union between man and woman was formalised through laws and social conventions. most muslim societies pursue the dictates of the holy quran.
that large american shadow all over
fareed zakaria's work is a masterpiece with great insights into the ever-changing 21st century world. this book is particularly significant when the us is suffering from multiple problems from anti-americanism to unpopular wars in iraq and afghanistan, from disappearing dollars to the most-recent hit of subprime disaster and when the rest of the world is emerging with much more economic capability than the military capability which america enjoyed throughout the 20th century. economic challenges have never been felt so harshly in world history as they are being felt in this 21st century.
the age of decline may have arrived
i couldn't believe it. never in my wildest dreams had i imagined something like this would happen to me. frustrated, anxious, irritable, i paced to-and-fro from shelf to shelf within the confines of our living room like a hungry tiger. taking the narrow steps of our staircase two at a time, i proceeded to feverishly examine the contents of the collection in the upstairs den only to return crestfallen once again. the horrible reality of it all began to sink in.
puzzles and mysteries
anyone who likes thrill and mystery blended into a well told story is certain to be completely immersed in this work by donna tartt. the book holds the reader in suspense with its saga of some students of greek language, their involvement in some ancient rites, a secret society and a mystery topped with a murder.
