our demand
if the present caretaker government fails to run the government properly, bangladesh will be in great danger. over the last thirty-six years, no government was widely accepted by the nation and no one in bangladesh respects our political leaders!

campus violence
since the incident at dhaka university on 20 august 2007, many people are thinking how a trifling matter can lead to a volcanic-eruption like situation that compelled the ctg to impose curfew in the divisional cities to bring it under control. expressing deep regret from the government, withdrawal of army camp from the varsity campus and the beginning of the process of judicial enquiry failed to satisfy the students. so thousands of them came out of the dormitories with sticks and stones and fought with police injuring over 150 people and damaging at least 100 vehicles. even the girl students came out in large numbers with bamboo sticks on their hands.
arrests of teachers
with the detention of a number of university teachers who are alleged to have incited the recent violence on and outside campuses across the country, the notion that teaching is a noble profession is now under dispute among many. with their positions tenured and a performance scrutiny mechanism non-existent, many of these self-styled intellectuals for years have not produced academic papers of some repute, lot of them have routinely affixed signatures on questionable statements, and a great number have been profiting enormously from coaching at private institutions. they, indeed, are modern day smooth operatives, just like politicians, and surely do not invoke the image of their predecessors much respected for dedication in shaping young minds. it is also naive to view them as 'genius' just because they happen to have good academic credentials; they are no more different from others who have opted for different professions and creditably performing in a competitive, unsheltered world. if our former president, prime ministers, and legislators can be questioned, booked, and jailed for their misdeeds, we do not see why the teachers should be immune from questioning for their suspected role in the violence that saw so much destruction. view the page international
