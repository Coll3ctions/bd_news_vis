as we observe victory day . . .
thirty eight years ago, it was an intensity of pride and a justified flow of emotions that brought to us the news that bangladesh stood liberated, that the new nation we had struggled long and hard to build out of the destruction wrought by the enemy had finally arisen on the global map. it was a formidable enemy we defeated in 1971. no fewer than 93,000 of pakistan's soldiers together with their civilian appendages had their comeuppance on 16 december 1971 as the victorious mukti bahini and the allied forces swept into the new nation's capital. nothing could be more poignant than the historic image of the pakistan occupation army, a force that had caused the death of three million bengalis, had raped countless women and had burnt and pillaged in villages and towns across the land, surrendering before the very people it had sought to exterminate or colonise in the nine months of the war.

surrender sites of pakistan army
after long nine months of genocide, rapes, arsons, loots, plunders and a short 13 days' 'war', pakistan army eastern commander lt. general amir abdullah khan niazi ('tiger') surrendered unconditionally on behalf of his 93 thousands war criminals and country at a public ceremony at dhaka ramna race course (now named suhrawardy uddan) to the bangladesh and indian joint command on 16 december 1971. since the end of second world war it is the largest surrender of any army. also, this is one of the fastest surrender in military history.
slow moving rickshaws
transports play an important role in carrying people and goods from one place to another. it may be both speedy and slow transports. rickshaw is one of them and unfortunately it is one of the causes of traffic jam. it causes traffic jam in the narrow lanes in the city area, especially in dhaka city. scooters are also responsible for traffic jam. as a result, traffic jam is a common phenomenon in our city life. it is also so acute in almost all the urban areas of bangladesh. so, to lead a traffic jam-free life rickshaws and scooters should be removed from the towns.
notebooks
one of the obstacles that is seen in the creative education system is guidebook and notebook. the main purpose of creative education system is to enhance creative thinking among the students. this education system mitigates the sole dependence of the students on memorizing. but if the guidebooks and notebooks are published the students are more likely to memorize the answers from those books. the teachers will also prepare question papers from such books. as a result, creativity among the students will not develop. due to the existence of guidebooks and notebooks, the students study the textbooks very little. the students also try to pass through adopting unfair means. realizing the truth, the government took the decision to ban guidebooks and notebooks. but publishers and sellers filed a writ petition against the government order. the high court dismissed it and upheld the order. after that the supreme court stayed the high court verdict following their petition. getting the opportunity they published guidebooks and notebooks.
palm tree plantation
the recent attempt of planting palm trees in different regions of bangladesh by a few individuals and organisations will go futile as the weather and soil condition of our country are not congenial for such plantations and this very fact is known to our experts and the forest department. a real life picture of palm trees bearing very ordinary fruits can be visualized on a trip to sylhet in the forests located by the side of highway which does not contain the material for either soap or edible oil. frequent rainfall all over the year, which is the very basic necessity for the productive growth of palm trees, is absent in our country. as a result, it is unlikely for us to grow palm trees for the production of edible oil.
crowded cities
the country is turning into the land of the rich and the poor. lots of people move to the towns every day leaving of the villages. as a result, the cities are getting crowded. but though they come to town in search of food and work for living, sometimes their dreams are not fulfilled.
attention: apollo hospital
in the past, following consultation, a patient used to get the prescription directly from the doctor at the apollo hospital. patient had the choice either to purchase the medicine from apollo's pharmacy or to buy outside. but now apollo doctors send all prescriptions through their local area network to their pharmacy billing.
winter is here
winter, the second last season & obviously the coldest season sets in again as per the rule of the nature and is greeting us with its little fog at night & dawn as it is the outset yet. we have been getting the indication of winter from the last few days. as a season of pithas it is second to none. different kinds of handmade cakes are made by our women, especially in rural areas to get the full taste of the winter. date juice adds more pleasure to that. besides, lots of colourful guest birds also come to bangladesh with the commencement of winter, as if winter invites the birds to stay for a while (two months). however, the winter of bangladesh is much more comfortable undoubtedly than the winter of other countries as we do not have snow & ice.
triumph of judiciary
the supreme court verdict on bangabandhu murder case has debunked gladstone's adage " justice delayed, justice denied". we had to wait for long 34 years to get justice. many nefarious machinations were taken to scupper the process of the trial. the indemnity ordinance was the first step in this regard. the villainous politicians were very active to save the self-declared killers of bangabandhu that was very unfortunate for our country. ultimately their attempts did not succeed ultimately. the apex court of bangladesh played its due role boldly and responsibly. we cannot but genuflect to the supreme court of bangladesh for its landmark judgement. now, the government should take necessary steps to execute the verdict as soon as possible. besides, it is imperative for the incumbent government to make diplomatic endeavours to extradite the convicts who are hiding in different countries. if the govt. succeeds in bringing back the ringleaders to bangladesh through the diplomatic process, it will be a great victory for the nation. we hope the al led government will leave no stone unturned to materialize the sc verdict for the sake of rule of law.
bad example
it is most unfortunate that still party clout and favouritism take precedence over the 'rule of law' to be equally dispensed with. the waiver of conviction of mr. akbar, son of an al leader, by the president is a glaringly bad example.
launch capsize
it is refreshing to see that the government has decided to take stern actions against those responsible for the recent launch capsize in bhola. if the authorities mean what they say, and are willing to follow through with it without bias or prejudice, it will set a precedence worth following.
firing range in forests
after going through a series of reports on depleting modhupur forests in the daily star, i visited the forest and became frustrated seeing the destroyed forests. but it was another surprising matter for me to see a baf firing range in rasulpur area of the forests. what is the effect of sounds of bombing by aircrafts on the animals of the forests ?
susang durgapur
susang durgapur situated in one of the districts of bangladesh called netrakona is 182 km from dhaka. it is a genuine natural splendour of woodland river & hills where the garos and other tribals reside. one can easily take pleasure in boating in the river, seeing the green bushes around, climbing hills etc. wild elephants at times comes from the jungle. however, going to susang durgapur is bothersome for both the domestic and overseas tourists because of the communication problem in this area. nonetheless, especially during winter, durgapur is crowded with many tourists.
hm ershad
i was surprised when i found the former president hussain mohammad ershad all of a sudden transformed himself from a poet to a columnist. his article 'untold story of grameen bank' gave me new information about the contribution of late general m.a. munim, his wife prof. ayesha akter munim and even a new insight on president ershad.
rickshaw issue
the logic is simple. eliminating rickshaws in dhaka city would mean less people would migrate to dhaka from the rural areas. this would be an effective way of controlling the population of dhaka. this would also mean less crime in dhaka as well as less traffic jam. as far as the rural areas go, the government will have to de-centralize and develop the other cities in bangladesh to create more opportunities for the people. let's all move forward and try to keep up with the rest of the world.
nizami's fatwa
a couple of days earlier, there were news reports in some bangla newspapers on mr. matiur rahman nizami, ameer of jamaat-e- islami. he is reported to have given a fatwa, 'religious ruling' that the present government's initiative to try the war criminals are, in fact, acts of anti-muslim and anti-islamic kind. we do not know wherefrom he brought these rulings of islam for the people of bangladesh, but we do hear the interpretations of the holy quran which rather emphasize severe punishments for rapists, arsonists, killers, unpatriotic citizens and collaborators who work against the motherland. in islam, the people who work against their homeland, support the occupiers and invite the invaders are "non-believers".
babri mosque case
it is so horrible and sad to learn that babri mosque was demolished at the order of top bjp leaders in india, back in 1992. this news was revealed as an indian newspaper was able to publish it on 23 november, 2009, before the liberhan comission was brought to indian parliament.
simply inhuman!
anyone visiting our lower courts both criminal and civil will find number of people including old, disabled, children and some mothers with their infants crowded in the open porch ( veranda) of the courtrooms, anxiously awaiting their turns of hearing inside the court chambers. they have to remain standing for hours. some tired of standing sit on the dirty floors to lessen their fatigue. one can see the pain and frustration on their faces. but they all have assembled there seeking justice. this looks so pathetic and horrible! no one seems to have felt or bothered about this inhuman treatment of people in front of our courts of justice, even after 38 years of our own rule. the scene in front of the courts of women and child repression is even worse, as if the government is teaching them lessons for filing cases. view the page international
