explosions in delhi and quetta
we are deeply distressed at the explosions which have once again claimed innocent lives in india and pakistan. we find hardly any words strong enough to condemn these mindless acts, barbarity which reduces lives to chaos and disfigures the fabric of society. on wednesday, even as indian prime minister manmohan singh was on a visit to bangladesh, a bomb explosion outside the high court in new delhi left 11 people dead and as many as 76 injured. the figures could go higher, as they usually do in such circumstances. on the same day, suicide attacks by the taliban in quetta left 24 people dead and no fewer than 86 others receiving injuries. in the case of the attack in delhi, the notorious huji outfit has reportedly claimed responsibility by e-mail. the explosions in quetta were obviously a retaliatory step by the taliban over the recent arrest of one of its operatives by the frontier corps paramilitary force and indeed occurred at the residence of the deputy chief of the force.

libyan rebels will soon understand
i have never been to libya and have not studied about this country very much. however, i had the opportunity to talk with many people who stayed in libya for a few years. i found that everybody was highly impressed with the leadership of gaddafi. libyan people, who supported the rebels, will soon understand what blunder they have made by removing gaddafi. libya had nothing before gaddafi took charge. gaddafi may not have been elected by the people but he has ensured food, housing, education and medical facilities to all the citizens which most of the governments (even the so-called democratic, but corrupt governments) failed to give. western world needs both libyan blood and oil. they got the first one and will get the oil soon. the world is for mighty people and not for the good people at this moment.

solution to our biggest problem
your article “imagine pm had said the opposite” on august 30 was unjust to the pm. it questions her loyalty to non-performing ministers and is non-appreciative of her overall vision. please note: one minister, who also is also a trade union president, recommends issuance of 25,000 driving licenses to anyone who can differentiate between a cow and a goat. human beings don't count. another one advocates that the malnourished people of bangladesh (except the fat cats) should “eat less”; on the lines of somalia?
