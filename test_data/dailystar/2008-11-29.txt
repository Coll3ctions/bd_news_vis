the first book of a new author*
niranjen sen, secretary of ipta (indian people's theatre association), was in the same jail with me at that time. his brother sachi sen was a publisher, who ran an office called the book world in hastings. street in calcutta. niranjan sen told me that if i ever wanted to publish a book, i should certainly look up his brother. i did indeed, after a little over a year, having come out from jail. he welcomed me with affection. but, needless to say, i could not get back my (old) job, after my release from jail, in spite of a lot of effort. when i was in jail, my wife went to writers' building and approached the then chief minister dr bidhan roy, with a request for a monthly allowance for herself. dr roy said to her: “why have you come for a monthly allowance now? go, and ask your husband to bring about a revolution!” he however did arrange for a monthly allowance of a hundred and fifty rupees for her. but it was stopped after my release from jail. i needed a job desperately. i had to face every day my starving children and wife, and pay a monthly rent of ten rupees for one room with a tiled roof. the landlady was one sukumari, whom we called suku-di. we were not scared of her, but of her childless daughter rambha. rambha was a young woman. she had been married off when she was a child, but her husband, instead of setting up a separate establishment, was living at her mother's house. rambha was quite healthy, and had a certain beauty too. but she was probably infertile, and maybe in frustration, her behaviour was harsh, she was arrogant in her manners, and her language was extremely rude and obscene. she was the only child of her mother. the first question that i faced immediately on coming back from jail was rambha's: “how will they pay rent now? no one can live here without paying.”

kali o kolom - agrahayon 1415 october 2008
the latest copy of kali o kolom, came with the announcement that the journal in partnership with hsbc has instituted two prizes for young poets and writers in order to encourage literary creativity. it is a welcome step, and no doubt will have its intended effect on bengali writers. 30th november 2008 is the centenary birth year of buddhadev bose. accordingly, there are four pieces on bose ( 'krorepatra’ ), accompanied by photographs of bose familiar to bengali readers, by bishwajit ghosh, mahbub sadek, gausur rahman and zakir talukdar. of these, talukdar's article offers a sympathetic defense of bose against his many detractors, pointing to the latter's reluctance to submit to a creed or dogma. zakir ends his piece by quoting some memorable buddhadev lines on the fact that the effect of all art is situational: “on the topic of rosh , nothing can be proved. nothing need be proved. the poem that enchants me on a chaitra -month noon, that same poem is mute on a rain-laden srabon -month night. the writing that could not touch the soul on an idle evening, two lines from that very writing can stop me in my tracks while chasing a tram on a frantic office morning.”

a lock of hair and a brittle cup
in the early 1980s, an exodus of english language teachers from bangladesh to libya provided hope to many others about a brighter future abroad for themselves and their families. hundreds of bengalis, largely men, queued up for interviews at centres in dhaka and quite a good number among them turned out to be the more fortunate ones among the lot. they went off to tripoli and from there to other spots in gaddafiland. fortunate? ah, there's the rub.
odyssey of a politician in the making
barack hussein obama casts a spell on us. he does it here as a writer in dreams from my father , with a very meaningful subtitle, a story of race and inheritance. although it is obvious that the narrative is in line with the travails of the author's discovering and re-discovering his father, nevertheless at the same time it is his finest tribute paid to his wonderful mother who was his friend, philosopher and guide. a burnt offering from a son to his mother when he says in the preface that he sees his mother everyday --- her joy, her capacity for wonder, in his daughters. he does not stop there but adds that "........ what is best in me i owe to her." thus a weeping soul that oftentimes is tired, somewhat baffled; and although it bends somewhat somewhere, it never breaks. there emerges a strong-willed young man, facing an antagonistic society at large and aiming at putting the pieces of his life into one mosaic in order to recognize his own self by tracing his roots that lie thousands of miles away in a village in kenya, in the generally less tempting continent of africa.
maturity above and beyond youthful years
if one would just let one's imagination run loose, her story could just as well have been one's story. mercifully, it is not, and the reader will realize why as s/he comes to the end of a compelling, in patches, disturbing, first novel. zahrah haider is a fifteen-year old british national with bangladeshi roots. and her novel is set in england. it revolves around amelia, a fifteen-year old girl who was born in august, the very month that zahrah was born. like the author, her fictional character enjoys listening to music, and being around pets. that, on the face of it, is as far as the superficial similarities between the author and her principal protagonist go.
