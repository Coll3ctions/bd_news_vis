khaleda's signal can be built up on
for the first time since the ruling al and the opposition bnp locked their horns on caretaker issue, we think, begum zia has indicated a willingness to have talks with the ruling party if the caretaker system were retained. though the prime minister had initially ruled out the retention of ctg 'after the court verdict', lately she has been making repeated overtures to the opposition leader urging her to place her formula for ctg reform on the table. this, she felt, was necessitated by the sc verdict as well as the experience with the abuse of the system in 2007-08.

behind the caretaker controversy
political climate in bangladesh, as of now, is ominously hot. the acrimonious debate centres around the retention or otherwise of the constitutionally incorporated neutral and non-partisan caretaker arrangement that oversees the general election. the apex court while pronouncing on the illegality of the caretaker dispensation has perhaps taken note of the political and administrative reality on ground. it is thus no wonder that while declaring the arrangement prospectively void, it has reportedly recommended the retention of the same for two more general elections.
india and the isi
it's a welcome development that new delhi has found time to hold talks with pakistan in the midst of internal upheavals that the manmohan singh government faces. foreign secretaries of the two countries are meeting later this month at islamabad. they talked to each other during the summit at thimpu, bhutan, in february but apparently found little time to pursue any topic.

cht forests: hidden treasure
forests occupy approximately one-third of earth's land area and contain about 70% of carbon present in living things. forests are a unique economic asset. they are the lungs of our planet and they provide for untapped potential of carbon capture and storage through afforestation, reforestation, and enhanced forest conservation, which is also a major component for climate change mitigation. at the same time, forest is the provider of many other ecosystem services such as freshwater enhancement, soil conservation, biodiversity conservation etc. the convention on biological diversity (cbd) considered forests throughout the world as the basis for more than 5000 products, from aromatic oil distilled leaves to herbal medicines, fuel, food, furniture, and clothing. however, total forestlands of bangladesh are decreasing day by day. as a signatory to cbd, it is mandatory to emphasize on conservation of every forest to enhance sustainable development including massive afforestation programme.
forests: ecological, economic and cultural services
forests and human beings are closely related with each other from the very beginning of the human history. great social value of forests and their many ecological and economic services render significant contribution towards maintaining life conditions on earth. however, forest resources are being depleted at a great pace worldwide causing increased threat for living conditions on this planet. in the face of continuing deforestation (at 5.2 million hectares worldwide per year) the theme of world environment day 2011 “forests: nature at your service” appeared rather challenged. at the juncture of global climate change and rapid deforestation in bangladesh (the annual rate in bangladesh is 3.3 percent which is 0.6 percent in south asia), it is now high time to look back at the ecological, economic and cultural roles played by forests. so that appropriate measures are taken before it is too late. view the page literature
syed manzoorul islam: tales of the post-modern
successful post-modern bengali writers of short stories in bangladesh are few in number. and surely syed manzoorul islam, professor of english at dhaka university, is among those few who have embellished the genre of short story in many ways. in contemporary bengali literature syed manzoorul islam is one of the remarkable pioneers of postmodernism and is equally well-versed in writing on a number of genres, namely short story, essay, novel, literary and art criticism. however, he disagrees with the notion of himself as an author of multifarious genres. he simply considers himself to be a storyteller. the way he relates stories is similar to the way gabriel garcía márquez tells his stories. both move from one point of view to another.
kolkata revisited . . .
i was visiting kolkata after ten long years. it was last december. one of my childhood friends received me at the airport. as he drove down the roads i remembered the times when i would travel with my mother from india to what was then east pakistan. night had fallen and i could hardly recognise the roads that took me to the area i was quite acquainted with --- elliot road in the park circus area. it was the place where i had gone to school. yes, we, my husband i, were going to live with my friends on elliot road, the spot where i spent twelve formative years of my life. it was loreto day school which had opened up my world to the world which beckoned outside. the roads seemed more crowded and pollution had increased. but the sounds and smells were the same that i had known earlier.

russia, iran, and the reset
in addition to improving cooperation on other issues, one of the goals of the obama administration's effort to "reset" russian-american relations was to obtain greater help from moscow with regard to the iranian nuclear issue. in 2010, it appeared that this policy was highly successful. in june 2010, russia joined with the us and most other members of the un security council in imposing increased sanctions on iran for its continued non-cooperation on the nuclear issue. and in september 2010, russian president medvedev announced that moscow would not be shipping the s-300 air defense missile systems to tehran that it had earlier agreed to do. so far in 2011, though, moscow has been backpedaling on iran. president medvedev has reverted to the earlier russian line that there is no proof that tehran seeks to acquire nuclear weapons. foreign minister lavrov has made clear -- repeatedly -- that moscow not only does not support further sanctions against iran, but thinks that the time has come to ease them.

between reality and fantasy
i was not surprised when presented with a printed copy of amiya sadnam chowdury's debut english novella wings as i had earlier had an opportunity to have a glimpse of the typed manuscript. what really surprised me was this young writer's grasp of the english language as it is not his mother tongue, nor was he brought up, as far as i know, in an ambience where this foreign language could be a part of his being. but it's not just the language of the novella that kept me almost glued to its pages. his very attractive art of storytelling pulled me along the pages of the rather slim volume of this novella.
friends in emotional upheaval
something borrowed is now a major motion picture that people are crowding to watch. this is a book for all people who have friends and know that the world can be a lively place when friends are around. the story is about loyalty to friends and about betrayals. rachel and darcy have been friends ever since their childhood. both girls have grown up as neighbors in indiana, usa. they have been best friends throughout their elementary and high school. and now both are in new york and are working; and the great thing is that they are still the best of friends. rachel, the lawyer, is the quiet and steady one and darcy, working for a private firm, is loquacious, the one who can be out partying all the time.
an inquiry into hindu philosophy
three separate long essays on the vedas, the concept of god in hinduism and the philosophy of the gita comprise the book sonaton sonskriti (hindu culture). the title is well enough to make one understand the contents of the book written by subrata bhattacharya, a philanthropic knowledge-seeker of kurigram, bangladesh. the worthy introduction by the noted naturalist dwijen sharma along with lucidity in language and simplicity in presentation have made sonaton sonskriti a good handbook for every reader, irrespective of religious beliefs or inclination.
the sorry end of a nationalist
fifty years after his murder, patrice lumumba continues to inspire spirited passion in asia, africa and latin america. of course, in the days when the soviet union was around, lumumba was accorded immortality through the establishment of a university after him in moscow. on top of everything, men who have waged bitter struggles against western colonialism around the globe have been relentless in their remembrance of the man who became the congo's founding prime minister and who, soon afterwards, was pushed to a death in the most horrible of circumstances.
