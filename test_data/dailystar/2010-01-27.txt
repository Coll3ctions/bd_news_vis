pm's warning against graft, abuse of power
quite frankly, one may have perhaps lost count of the times prime minister sheikh hasina has warned her party colleagues against indulging in corruption, abuse of power and impinging on law of the land. there can be two ways of looking at her exhortative flourish. first, she is probably having to repeat her directives simply to hammer home the hard truth that just as a vigilant electorate enthusiastically enthrones a party in power it can with vengeance unseat it if it delivers mis-governance. there is an element of sagacity here. secondly, her repeated recital of warnings may have been prompted by a self-realisation that her exhortation are yet to have the desired effect. if that is true, it's all the more welcome because of an implied connotation of self-criticism.
ugc report on university education
the annual report submitted to parliament by the university grants commission for the year 2008 is a clear wake up call that needs to be heeded. the ugc informs us that the objectives of higher education are not being met by the nation's public and private universities, barring we would add, some notable exceptions. there is something of the ironic here. when private universities began to be set up in the early 1990s, it was expected that they would not only widen the sphere of education but would also, in a proper spirit of competition, help enhance the quality of it. while some of them may well have met the expectations, the majority have not.
beyond the state of the bonsai
we keep talking about democracy, about building it and strengthening it at the grassroots. that is a fine thing to do, a manifestation of sharpened political sensibilities. every now and then we go back to the anodyne thought of how liberal we as a people have always been, of how democratic aspirations have regularly been an underpinning of our collective societal thought. and while we have been busy with all this, we have seen a whole caravan of undemocratic elements run riot over the years and come to commandeer the state in ways that have outraged the civilised and the sophisticated. beginning with the early years of pakistan and going up to the ershad coup of the early 1980s, we have seen our much vaunted democratic aspirations take a bad mauling, and repeatedly, at the crossroads of time.

bangladesh's image
i was searching in the popular internet search engine google with the key word “bangladesh” for a web result and got scared to find the result. the reason behind my scare was some photos that automatically came with the web result. i again tried many times with the same key word and always found the same web result with same terrible photos. you can also try and i am sure you will be frightened to see the photos if you are a patriotic citizen of this country. no, the photos do not contain any horror content or ghostly things. one photo shows a cop beating a journalist and another depicts a military parade and contains the caption “bangladeshi bdr massacre”. these photos portray a negative image of the country to the world. so these are really painful for any bangladeshi. today, in the age of information technology, if anybody outside bangladesh needs to know about the country at first he or she will go to internet and will find a negative impression of bangladesh. bangladesh might have many problems but certainly this country is a model of communal and religious harmony. we have a glorious past and we are also an example of rising democracy. so why this country is being portrayed in such a negative way. please describe bangladesh in a constructive way. i think google does not show these photos intentionally as it works automatically by using some programming formulas. the authorities of websites containing these pictures are responsible for this fault. they should immediately delete these pictures.
