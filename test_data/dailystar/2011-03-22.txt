torture of domestic workers
we express deep concern over the repeated stories of torture against domestic workers, the latest reported case that of nine-year-old baby in khulna, who was not only underfed but also allegedly beaten by her employers with sticks and electric wires. as is often the case, the child's parents were unable to file a case and baby saved herself the only way she could, by running away. not all domestic workers are as lucky, however. numerous cases have been reported where they have borne inhuman torture, some of them allegedly murdered and others forced to commit suicide. view the page sports

all is not over, i hope
my editor was so saddened by the inglorious exit of the tigers from the cricket world cup that his pen did not move to write the obituary. i am also hurt, rather deeply wounded and intensely perturbed by the last defeat of the team. still i write to tell you that all is not over. the young boys have shown flicker of hope in the four out of six games that they played. it was a calamity against the west indies and a tragedy against the south africans.
lessons from fukushima
on day 1 (march 12), they dismissed it as a minor accident. on day 2, when there was an explosion at the fukushima daiichi nuclear plant, they denied it was an emergency "as described by [the] media." one of them described it as "a well-planned emergency preparedness programme." on day 3, as the crisis worsened, they maintained it would be over soon.
sustainable impacts for the extreme poor
the term "sustainability" is often heard in policy discussions on poverty alleviation. how can we achieve sustainable positive impacts in the lives of the extreme poor; gains that are protected and can be built upon after a poverty alleviation project has ended?
nuclear disaster in japan
japan is in the throes of an epic disaster of a magnitude the world has not seen before. the earthquake of 8.9 magnitude in the richter scale, with the epicentre only a few kilometres away from the fukushima reactors (6 units), was the strongest in living memory in japan. the many aftershocks of 6/6.5 magnitude were considered as minor irritations, whereas in any other place a 6 magnitude earthquake would have been considered a major disaster.

icy gaze into big bang
scientists of the institute for quantum optics and quantum information (iqoqi) in innsbruck, austria, have reached a milestone in the exploration of quantum gas mixtures. in an international first, the research group led by rudolf grimm and florian schreck has succeeded in producing controlled strong interactions between two fermionic elements -- lithium-6 and potassium-40. this model system not only promises to provide new insights into solid-state physics but also shows intriguing analogies to the primordial substance right after the big bang.
how serious is japan nuclear crisis?
as it was almost bound to do at some point, japan's nuclear safety agency has uprated its assessment of the fukushima power station incident from a level four to a level five.
atom smasher a time machine!
in a 'long shot' theory, physicists propose that the world's largest atom smasher could be used as a time machine to send a special kind of matter backward in time.
mind melds with machine
nerve cell tendrils readily thread their way through tiny semiconductor tubes, researchers find, forming a crisscrossed network like vines twining towards the sun. the discovery that offshoots from nascent mouse nerve cells explore the specially designed tubes could lead to tricks for studying nervous system diseases or testing the effects of potential drugs. such a system may even bring researchers closer to brain-computer interfaces that seamlessly integrate artificial limbs or other prosthetic devices.
carnivores that suck up prey
carnivorous bladderworts trap prey with speed that would make a bond villain shudder in gleeful envy.
a nerve cell in three-dimension
for the first time, scientists have reconstructed a three-dimensional circuit of connected cells in the brain's seat of consciousness. their new approach, which involves the use of high-tech microscopes and a supercomputer, offers the unprecedented opportunity to unravel the complex wiring of the brain by navigating through the tangled and dense jungle of cells similar to the way google crawls the web.
how can we foretell earthquake?
china has suffered some terrible earthquakes, and it isn't surprising that china's scientists want to find ways of forecasting them. in 1975, they were successful. they cleared the city of haicheng two hours before a devastating quake and saved the city's population. earthquake forecasting is, however, still inexact; the chinese have failed to predict several earthquakes since 1975, but they have advanced the science of earthquake prediction.
