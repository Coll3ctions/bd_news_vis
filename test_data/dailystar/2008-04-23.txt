bengali women, equal rights and obscurantism
there are questions you need to ask today about the ruckus whipped up by men unhappy about women enjoying the same rights as they, in this country. and the first question that you need to raise, and expect an answer to, relates to the equality enshrined in the nation's constitution for women. obviously, if you hold absolute faith in democracy and everything that gives it a definitive flavour of the modern, you will not deny that bangladesh's women do have a place in the political and social scheme of things. the constitution may have been tampered with in many ways and has, through years of arbitrary government, been rendered emasculated at places. but one truth it has upheld is the esteem in which bengali women are held, and will be held in the times to be. that being so, you go on to the next question.

power crisis
every year, at the beginning of the summer a crisis looms large - power shortage. it has been going on for decades and there is no sign of relief in reality other than some vague statements from our leaders, especially political leaders and sometimes from the bureaucrats in order to please their bosses. but i do not see any real action or policy in place that can solve the problem even in the next 10 years. as a professional engineer working in the power sector, i feel for the people in bangladesh and am worried about the financial impact the crisis is causing (going to be worse in the coming years). it is like a vicious circle, we have to spend more because we do not have enough which drives us to an even poorer level to spend even more. the industries and housing sectors are using expensive generators and we are wasting millions of hard-earned dollars on these equipment and the fuel because we do not have a reliable power system. the production cost of garment sector is higher because they have to use generators and expensive fuel. a reliable power system would lower the production cost of all products and make bangladesh more attractive to the buyers.

brutality at zia
the recent incident at zia in which a british bangladeshi gentleman, barrister rizwan hussain, was brutally beaten up by airport officials for entering a restricted area of the check-in zone of the airport is utterly deplorable and terribly shocking. it is indeed a shameful incident that will scar the nation's reputation, an event that is not just a reflection of zia service standards, but also an insult to the citizens of the country. it is my hope that the government makes it a priority to bring the five culprits, who have resorted to such brutal violence against a fellow countryman, to justice as soon as possible. i hope they will be punished accordingly.
bangabandhu
recently, i read an article on bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman and the first thought that came to mind was the man we saw and heard in the penultimate days of east pakistan and the man who lead the war of independence. there wasn't the information to match the person we knew. bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman was the man who created a nation and proved to the world that one of the most powerful and disciplined military forces couldn't subjugate and suppress the unarmed and impoverished bengali nation. he was the man who stirred the nation out of its slumber, galvanized it and inspired it to turn every home into a fortress, armed with mostly bamboos and antiquated weapons to rise up and free the country from the clutches of subjugation. he was the man who won a landslide victory in the 1970 elections. people reposed in him the huge responsibility of giving them a direction and showing the way to the bliss of freedom. he was given the power to spearhead the revolution. all these i witnessed in my teens in the turbulent years of the late 60s till the early years of the seventies. were all these illusions and mirages? view the page international
