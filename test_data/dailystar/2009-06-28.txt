june 21-june 25, 2009
international markets
the currency market continued to remain highly volatile this week. early on in the week the market was wary over before the fomc meeting and the us debt auctions. euro was also sold on uncertainty before the ecb 1 year refinance operation. the dollar was little changed on thursday, supported after the federal reserve said it would maintain its programme of buying government and mortgage debt while adding it saw signs the effects of the recession were easing. the swiss franc edged up against the euro and the dollar, reversing some losses after the swiss national bank on wednesday was suspected to have sold the franc to curb its strength. the euro pulled back from a two-week high hit on wednesday following solid demand at the european central bank's refinancing tender of one-year lending. analysts said the dollar would be supported as the fed's statement after its policy meeting made no mention of plans to step up quantitative easing, which some market participants had considered to be a downside risk to the dollar. analysts said that ecb's allotment of 442 billion euros in one-year lending to the market on wednesday would flood the market with euro liquidity, which would push down short-term rates and dent the euro. others added that the fact that the ecb is belatedly catching up with quantitative easing measures implemented by other major central banks may put the euro on the back foot. view the page metropolitan
