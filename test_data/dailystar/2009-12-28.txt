on ashura, we recall the sacrifices in karbala
today is a day of mourning for muslims, indeed for all people who believe in the righteousness of a cause, all over the world. the sacrifices through which imam hussein (ra) and his followers saw their lives come to an end on the battlefields of karbala hundreds of years ago were fundamentally proof once again that martyrdom in defence of faith is a supreme act of nobility. the grandson of the holy prophet of islam (peace be upon him) has, through his valour and through his refusal to submit before the brute forces led by yazid, imparted the important lesson that it is the moral responsibility of anyone confronted with gross and manifest injustice to engage in a battle that has as its goal the triumph of good. in karbala, it was patently an epic struggle between good and evil. imam hussein (ra) and his followers, rather than give in to the sinister forces typified by yazid and his gang of usurpers, happily went down the path of supreme sacrifice.

our forests
the letter by dr reza khan with the above title published in your newspaper (ds061209) draws attention to the dire need of bangladesh. if the government and the people of bangladesh want to keep their forests and the biodiversity, it is high time that the government takes responsibility for a quick decision. the political will is the major force to implement such a decision. dr reza khan has been championing this idea of having a separate department for managing the wildlife and other remaining natural forests. if the government and the policy makers take a positive decision the future generation bangladeshis would remember them with gratitude.
us policy
instead of withdrawing armed forces from iraq and afghanistan, the usa has committed yet another mistake with the deployment of 35,000 additional troops in afghanistan.
stop name game
in the context of proposed name change of dhaka international airport, and other measures like portrait removal, signboard removal etc that happens every time a different party comes to power sadly reminds me of the english proverb: "little things please little minds".
rivers
many rivers flow into various parts of our countryside in a zigzag way and these rivers are the main source of livelihood for most of the people here. those who live in the coastal areas have to depend more on the bay.
unjust accusation
a few days ago more than two thousand trees were cut down from our coastal area near sitakundu . we are against this deforestation. we tried our best to save those trees as they saved us from many natural calamities, cyclones etc. we gave our comments to electronic and print media against this crime. but it is matter of great regret that some people in sitakundu area who are opposing deforestation have been accused of cutting trees.
pinak's diplomacy
mr pinak is going to be replaced by rajeet mitter currently india's ambassador to philippines. mr pinak's stint in bangladesh flagrantly displayed the indian mindset about bangladesh. india as a regional power should behave responsibly with its nearest neighbours. but what we see is quite disappointing. its prolonged espionage policy prolonged the fighting in sri lanka. with bangladesh india always behaved like a bullyboy. everyday bsf kill, kidnap and torture bangladeshi nationals at the border areas. sheikh mujib handed over berubari in 1974 but india is yet to transfer the full control of tin bigha to bangladesh. the newly emerged talpatti island is occupied by india and she along with myanmar tried to mobilize troops with a view to exploring minerals at the disputed maritime boundary. india always accuses bangladesh of harbouring jihadists. but it is india that actively patronized and still patronizing shanti bahini to fight for the separation of what is the one tenth of the land of bangladesh,
austerity & benevolence
it came from newspaper reports that a celebrated indian minister travelled in the economy class of the plane while on official visits. the present congress chairperson also did the same thing. then came the news of a young mp who travelled in the general class of the train. when fellow passengers discovered him beside them they became overwhelmed & commented, is not he our leader rahul gandhi? yes, he did what is expected from a dedicated true leaders of the people. let us see what gain is achieved from this deed of austerity. those doing this earned admiration, confidence and trust of the people. the government got money that has been saved which can be spent for other beneficial purposes.
cheats at work
dhaka is the capital of our country and its present population is over 1.5 millions. every day several thousands of people visit the local markets like karwan bazar, new market, moulvibazar, gulshan market, uttara market, shyambazar, narinda market etc to buy their daily necessities. it has been observed that most of the shopkeepers give "less quantity' for each purchase of products. on an average for "each purchase" a minimum of 100 grams to 150 grams is given "less" to purchasers. hence the purchasers are losing something for their purchases. they have no mechanism to "check the weight" at every point of purchase and challenge the shopkeepers.
psychoanalytic therapy
psychoanalytic therapy is a form of treatment, which aims to cure mental disorders by investigating the interaction of conscious and unconscious elements in the mind. it is a special method of any standard medical centre to cure disorder of human mind through using a kind of technique. the classic method of doing this is to get the patient to talk freely, in such a way that the repressed fears and conflicts, which are causing the problems, are brought into the conscious mind and openly faced, rather then remaining “buried” in the unconscious. this practice is based upon specific theories of how mind, the instincts, and sexuality work. through this psychoanalysis therapy one-third portion of mental patient may be able to come back to normal life.
stock market
only recently the prime minister referred to our stock market index in several of her meetings in the usa and felt complacent.
merry christmas!
there are two different opinions regarding the emergence of this world, some people think this world is a tiny part of the logical causal chain which started with the big bang, the others are convinced that it is finally the fault of adam and eve because they did not observe the one holy law of god: "when the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. she also gave some to her husband, who was with her . . ."
nuclear power plants
our brotherly and friendly neighbouring country india recently announced that they had decided to set up five nuclear power plants( a huge scheme) simultaneously. whether india, the rich country where the poorest people live, should or shouldn't set up five nuclear power plants is not the point i would like to emphasize. would they be able to keep things under control? this is a great concern for this part of the world. this is a question of balance of power and peaceful co-existence in south asia.
we are pleased
after what i have read through the daily prothom alo's column dated 09/12/09 regarding copenhagen conference, and, their unflinching support to bangladesh's cause, i can only offer my gratitude to them for not failing the duties and responsibilities to be discharged for the cause of humanity.
bnp's posturing
recently, the bnp held its national council after 16 long years and it is doubtful whether it would have been held at all had it not been a requirement for registration with the election commission. but the result is far from a manifestation of its claim to be a democratic party. at the end of fiery speeches by loyal leaders who were trying to outdo one another in showing their allegiance to the chairperson, they ended up surrendering all powers of electing office bearers of different levels to begum zia, thereby making the party an autocratic one. what can people expect from such a party!
one-child family
i think this will be a positive move towards population control. however, i don't think it will be easy to control the population because both rickshaw pullers and the women who roam around town begging for money can produce children like vending machines.
green brick kiln
thousands of brickfields around dhaka emit a huge quantity of black smoke every day and night and the polluted air just remains there above our head. according to the department of environment (doe), about 30 percent air pollution is caused by brick kilns. this is an important cause behind the rising rate of lethal lung cancer. view the page international
