the pm is being embarrassed by her own party
even if her enemies had tried they couldn't have done a better job of embarrassing sheikh hasina and her barely two-week-old government. first the bangladesh chhatra league (bcl), student wing of awami league (al), and now the party's grassroots leaders, including a cabinet minister and an mp, have done precisely the things that she has promised, and is trying to, totally move away from. their actions have brought blemish upon her and her party's brilliant electoral victory and raised unnecessary doubts in the public mind as to how serious is the al chief's commitment to bring “change” in politics and in governance.

the lost parakeet
alexandrine parakeet, locally known as chandana, is now on the verge of extinction in bangladesh because of loss of habitat, poaching and pesticide use. a flock of eight pairs of the parakeet was recently found at beelbharat village of bhayadanga union in sreebordi of sherpur by dr reza khan. explaining the reasons for their near extinction from bangladesh, prof anwarul islam of zoology department of dhaka university said these birds compete with other hole nesters like barbet and woodpecker. so they are vulnerable to the loss of nesting sites and competition with other nest dwellers. trade in parrot also led to the swift decline in their numbers. but at beelbharat village, these eight pairs have found a safe haven although one of them had been captured as a chick and caged by a resident. these emerald green birds are larger than the common parakeet found elsewhere and have reddish streak on wings, but from a distance they are hard to recognise.

annoyance is not enough
agriculture minister matia chowdhury has informed the nation about prime minister sheikh hasina's annoyance at the behaviour of a minister and a ruling awami league lawmaker at the recent upazila elections. that is as it should be, for no individual holding a responsible position should be allowed to do anything that is unethical and unbecoming of his or her position. what fisheries and livestock minister abdul latif biswas did is unpardonable and so is the behaviour of the young mp from cox's bazar-4. in this regard, the assertion of the prime minister that the election commission is free to take action against these two individuals is welcome and we hope an example is set that will act as a deterrence against similar activities by anyone in future.
congratulations to shakib
we are bit confused! we can't easily tell which one is the cake and which the icing on it. is shakib-al hasan's coming first among the top ten all-rounders in world cricket is the cake, or bangladesh national side's near- consistent performance against world cricketing power sri lanka followed by a convincing odi series win against zimbabwe is. depending upon which is perceived to be truer, the one that is outvoted would obviously be the icing of the cake.

better lives for bangladeshi women
bangladesh's elections were a great achievement: free, fair and even festive, with a massive voter turnout. but, as i return to this remarkable country after four years, what sticks in my mind are the vivid images, flashed across our screens, of women queuing patiently to vote on that chilly december day. of the 82 million bangladeshis that were registered as voters, 41 million were women: hugely impressive for any country. view the page sports

dear mr president obama,
the last two decades have seen the geo-political lines redrawn on a scale not seen since the second world war. the drama is still playing itself out at many war theaters around the world from afghanistan to iraq, from congo to sudan, from abkhazia to chechnya, from east timor to tibet and from assam to kashmir the global village is more akin than ever to a cauldron of suffering humanity fought by warmonger chieftains supported in many cases by the war machines of great powers, the greatest of which is of course the usa.

a new era begins
the world has happily witnessed the historic event of america's 44th president barack hussein obama's assuming the office the other day. the vibrant inauguration programme, the historic presidential speech by the president and the teeming crowds of the people flocking around washington d.c. and beyond marked the occasion to such an extent that people across the world are, as it appears, struggling to find the fitting term to attach to the day --- the day's spirit! it is, as some tend to say, the most important day on this earth in this twenty first century with all its difficult twists and turns, as people across the globe have found a fitting leader with vision and clarity of thoughts and action in the 44th president of the usa.
zionist aggression
smoke rose above the gaza strip as the zionist entity israel continued its assault on the palestinians in the region. schools, mosques and civilian buildings were being subjected to indiscriminate bombing from israeli fighter jets. there are reports that israel had even used unconventional weapons against civilians in gaza. the world was witnessing another severe blow against the principles and values of humanity. yet the international community could do nothing to stop israel from killing innocent civilians. the un security council, the job of which was supposed to ensure global peace and security, miserably failed to condemn israel's disproportionate use of force in gaza.
indigenous peoples' expectations
it is estimated that there are 370 million indigenous peoples in more than 70 countries around the world. they represent over 500 languages and cultures. as per available information here in bangladesh more than 45 indigenous communities can be found. they have been living here from time immemorial. the united state's permanent forum on indigenous issue, an advisory body established by the economic and social council in 2000, has been working with the mandate to address indigenous issues related to economic and social development, education, health and human rights. the un declared an “ indigenous decade” (1995-2005) and called upon all the countries to join hands in preserving and developing the unique cultures, religion and languages of indigenous peoples. many countries came forward but the then government of this country did not support the declaration. rather the government said, “ there are no indigenous peoples in bangladesh.” such an irrational statement shocked the indigenous peoples in the country.
nury vittachi's column
nury vittachi's struggle to break down the barrier of cultural stagnation and indefatigable effort to bring a way of expressing feelings through a humorous but standard way should be appreciated. visiting the website www.vittachi.com i came to know about asia's one of the most widely published writers. his dialogue based columns added a new frame in writing columns. his way of pointing fingers towards problems of our society is really unique. in a column named "we are all robots", he wrote that people can be incredibly stupid. there were some reasons behind pointing finger towards journalists. i think it would be bit better to say, "people (excluding me) can be incredibly stupid. because i have discerned the problem."
cases against hasina
three extortion charges were filed against sheikh hasina in june 2007, which led to her arrest on july 16 that year. those were the grounds for arresting her and detaining her for nearly a year and on parole to date.
obama makes history
barack obama has stepped into the history of america as the first black african-american leader swearing in as the 44th us president. we whole-heartedly congratulate obama as the new american president and leader of the world and would like to remind him of the pledge 'change we need' he made with the people and urge him to follow the true democratic principles in governance and in maintaining foreign policies. reasonably, we hope his pragmatic and efficient leadership will bring about qualitative changes.
obama's silence
obama remained silent during the gaza crisis. barack obama's chances of making a fresh start in us relations with the muslim world, and the middle east in particular, appeared to diminish with each new wave of israeli attacks on palestinian targets in gaza.
an open letter to pm
first of all, i would like to felicitate our honourable pm, sheikh hasina on her taking the leadership of the country. your election manifesto was so forward-looking, innovative and visionary that most of the first-time voters were galvanized to support you and your party. actually, the people of bangladesh were passing through a very crucial time for the last seven years. we wanted a change. the people of bangladesh voted for you with a great hope to shape up their destiny. but will they be able to do that? i strongly hope that you will play your due role in this regard. we want that you do nothing but fulfil your poll pledges. if you fulfil your commitments, we will not have any complaint against you and your government or party. i earnestly implore you to pay attention to the following demands:
arab leaders
it will be in vain for the arab leaders to approach america on the issue of palestine, as israel is a disobedient son of the usa.
where is the change?
the bcl clashes with their rivals in the educational institutions are really unfortunate and unacceptable. the present government has been sworn in power to bring about positive changes. we have been passionately and resonantly waiting to witness the change.
poor decision making
i really wonder when the bcb and its selectors would come to a firm decision on captaincy. this man has all the excuses in the world to explain why bangladesh is failing in the critical situations. he never told us about his own failure as captain, though. his funny comment is, " if we played better; so and so did better, we would have won the game!!” he has failed as captain and is now gradually falling behind his potential as batsman too.
lobbying by teachers
a recent article in your daily titled "hectic lobbying for university posts" (ds jan 21)reflects how politics has deeply entered into the public universities of our country. the report says that some pro-al teachers of different public universities are now trying to get the posts of vc, pro-vc and other important posts by lobbying with the government high-ups. unfortunately though, this has been the usual story of public universities where vcs, pro-vcs etc are appointed on the basis of their partisanship rather than on the basis of teaching experience, seniority and quality.
gulshan-banani bridge
a few days ago a resident of one of the houses around the new tk 32 crore gulshan-banani bridge wrote a long letter in the ds, describing how life for the nearby residents has become intolerable because of the shenanigans of the youth disembarking all around the bridge from expensive cars, who carousel loudly far into the night disturbing the peace of the area while indulging in their expensive “hobbies”- fast cars and faster women, loud music and louder stimulants from bottles and packs.
don't blame cricketers
last friday we all witnessed an epic final which eventually turned into a tragic moment in the short history of bangladesh cricket. after that i heard many people blaming our captain ashraful for this defeat. he was barely getting any kind of support from the people who actually call themselves or act like real supporters. but they don't realize how difficult it is to lead a team which is struggling so much for existence in the international arena. i agree that our team has lost a golden opportunity to win their first tri-nation cup. but people should accept it as a positive thing.
pollution
pollution is the most talked about issue these days. there are many reasons behind pollution of the environment. smoke that comes out from the brickfields is a major reason behind such pollution. from the chimney which is used to burn raw bricks smoke comes out continuously and pollute the environment severely. but we cannot think of modern civilization without bricks. as there is no alternative to burning bricks we should be a bit careful in doing so for our own survival. smoke mixes up with air & pollutes our environment if the chimney is not very tall . a tall chimney can minimize the harmful effect of smoke in the environment. when the chimney is high enough smoke that comes out vanishes in the steam & it can not pollute the environment as it does when the chimney is low. again, in the brickfield there work children aged 10 to 15 years, though it is very risky. it is want of food that compels those children to do hard work while it is time to study & play. the owners of the brickfields are making money, showing no concern for the future of those poor children. view the page international
