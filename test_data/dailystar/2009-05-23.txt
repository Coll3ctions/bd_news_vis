economy and environment under threat
nearly forty years ago in the late sixtys we came across a news item that india was contemplating a river-linking project. the indian river-linking project, regarded as a myth so long, turned a reality when the supreme court of india in 2002 authorized it. there are two components of the project: one, linking fourteen himalayan rivers in northern india and the other connecting sixteen peninsular rivers including the ganges and the brahmaputra. bangladesh has reportedly expressed its grave concern on the potential impacts of the project on both economy and environment of the country. it is apparent that the bulk of the waters for the project will come from the brahmaputra and the ganges, particularly the brahmaputra, dwarfing the combined flow of other peninsular rivers.

walking the walk
the nineteenth century french poet baudelaire coined the term 'flâneur'--meaning a "gentleman stroller of city streets." he derived it from the french masculine noun flâneur, basically meaning a "stroller." in baudelaire's use the flâneur became a character who was something more than a mere stroller, broadened to mean somebody participating in, and portraying, his city. a flâneur played a dual role in city life--simultaneously a part of and apart from--combining sociological, anthropological, literary and historical ideas of the relationship between the individual and the masses.

indian elections and the bangladesh perspective
there is a similarity in the just announced results of the indian elections with bangladesh's on december 29th. the winners in both cases were expected to win but the ultimate results were beyond their most optimistic expectations. in india's case, the congress led united progressive alliance (upa) overcame the anti-incumbency bug to return to power. manmohon singh, already named to become prime minister for another term, will thus become the first pm after jawaharlal nehru in 1961 to return to office in successive elections. it was the congress' best show in many decades. the party won 203 seats; a number they passed in 1984 and 1991, both held after assassinations (1984, indira gandhi; 1991, rajiv gandhi) that brought the party sympathy votes.

identifying a crisis of identity
a nation, in one scholar's reasonably comprehensive characterization, denotes “people whose common identity creates a psychological bond and a political community. their political identity usually comprises such characteristics as a common language, culture, ethnicity and history. more than one nation may comprise a state, but the terms nation, state, and country are often used interchangeably. a nation-state is a state is a state populated primarily by the people of one nationality.” essentially, nationalism is a state of the mind of those who feel they belong together as a nation. bangladesh is an old nation embodied in a new nation-state. khan md. lutfor rahman, however, in nation building problems in bangladesh: a socio-economic-political perspective, states at the outset: “bangladesh is a new nation with multiethnic and multi-religious plurality of population.” halfway through the book, though, he acknowledges that “the genesis of the nationhood of bangladesh has a pretty long history. its history stretches back to the ancient period.” rahman's book is similarly uneven in quality, some insightful analysis coexisting with some incoherent material and the occasional sloppy research work.
