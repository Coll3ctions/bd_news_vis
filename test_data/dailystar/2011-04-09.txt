poetry in thread: the jamdani of dhaka
from various historical accounts, folklore and religious texts, it appears that very fine fabrics were available in bengal as far back as the first century bce. once such celebrated fabric of the subcontinent is the jamdani of dhaka (present day bangladesh). the jamdani weave as we see it today is essentially a fusion of the ancient weaving techniques of bengal which is around 2,000 years old, with the gossamer like “muslin” produced here since the 14th century. the jamdani weave therefore represents over two thousand years of continuous aesthetic evolution that blends different artistic influences.

climatic hazards: vulnerability and adaptation
it is now widely recognised that the coastal regions of the world would suffer severely both in economic and social fronts from the direct impact of global warming and rising sea level. it has been noticed that in recent years sea-level rise, frequent storms and cyclones, and riverbank erosion have taken a serious turn in the coastal regions of the bay of bengal. these necessitate checking up vulnerability of the coastal people. in particular, investigation on the livelihood in terms of socio-economic vulnerability (risk) of the coastal population is of paramount importance. two initiatives are urgent: one, investigating the types of adaptation measures available to overcome the economic and social devastation from frequent and extreme climatic hazards locally and nationally; two, measuring the socio-economic vulnerability of the frontline coastal regions for policy purposes.
rising sea level in a changing climate
advances in climate change modeling enable us to obtain best estimates of temperature, rainfall, and sea level and their likely uncertainty ranges given a projected warming with different emission scenarios. results for different emission scenarios are provided explicitly in the intergovernmental panel for climate change (ipcc) report. projected global average surface warming for the end of the 21st century (20902099) relative to 19801999 with best estimates and likely ranges for global average surface air warming for six special reports on emission scenarios (sres) are shown in table 1. the model-based projections of global average sea level rise at the end of the 21st century (20902099) are also shown in table 1.
london 2012 . . . a study in greening
britain is going all the way out to make sure that the london olympics next year becomes a memorable part of history. nothing has been left untouched, everything has been touched --- for people to go back home, once the games are over, with the feeling that london is a place which keeps reinventing itself. that is not, if you think about it, unusual. quite a few centuries ago, it was samuel johnson who pronounced the unambiguous judgement that one who is tired of london is tired of life. london 2012 does not promise to be tiring, or tiresome, at all. you have to look at merely one of the many aspects of the olympics preparations to comprehend conditions as they happen to be a year prior to the commencement of the games. view the page literature
'i gotta feeling…'
okay, beautiful! now i have to cross the road, the thing i hate to do. i don't know if they have a specific medical term for the fear of crossing roads. they should have one. if they can have a name for the fear of spider (arachnophobia ), why can't mine get a name, too? crossophobia- the fear of crossing the road! nice! or it can be “roadophobia”, right? anyways, the green signal is on for walking. like a very smart raccoon, i carefully looked at my right and left and crossed the road with other people. but do raccoons follow the traffic signals? no, they just jaywalk, because they are little furry animals and not humans. maybe i have too much coffee in my system and now high on caffeine and thinking of how the traffic signal system works in raccoon society.
the cage of bones
the sickening light of the old lantern is disrupted by the gust of the stirring wind blown from the horizon. then the dark lingering in the background invades. a breath of air emanating from the trees and their outer coatings has assumed the form of pent-up thoughts. the sky looks grave tonight. the moon has vanished without a trace. latif stares over the marauding wall of darkness leaning on the damp courtyard. he cannot spot the faces squatting before him. he wonders if they are humans or just a cluster of warped shadows. how these devils have poked in at the right time as if snuffling about in the air! when he got down from the launch this morning, no one showed up. he himself had to carry the entire luggage heavy with bottles and glasses inside. how shameful, he had thought, to carry all those loads before his dhakaite pals! where were they hiding at that time? having arrived mia bari he had to holler at abdul to reassert himself-'you faithless thugs! i had to carry all the bags. then why do we feed so many servants?'

the libyan denouement?
the odyssey is one of two major ancient greek epic poems attributed to homer. the poem is fundamental component to the modern western canon. now that odyssey is the code name of the latest us military operation in libya-odyssey dawn. the present word odyssey is very much linked to the mythical hero odysseus. international relations, more specifically strategic studies, never got such a similar literary taste or dimension before this. the us may be assuming its operation in libya is going to be a prolonged and protracted, one with hardship and tough resistance ahead. it is almost like a ten years long journey, which once was carried out by odysseus way back to 8th century bc to get back to his beloved family after returning from trojan war. is libya aggression going to be another "odyssey journey" for the us and thus for other european partners?

between a bang and a whimper
at first glance, the rather imposing title women and militancy: south asian complexities might conjure up in the reader visions of profound insights into what apparently should be a very interesting topic, possibly unusual in the field of academia: a correlation between women and militancy (notwithstanding the celebrated cases of leila khaled, djamila bouhired, djamila boupacha et al!). and, when the subtitle is considered, the reader's interest might get aroused even more, especially if s/he is of this region or has more than a passing curiosity in it. in the event, his/her experience would likely fall below expectations, more so because south asia is limited to bangladesh and only stretched beyond its territorial boundaries to include the proximate northeast indian state of meghalaya. beyond the rather misleading subtitle, amena mohsin and imtiaz ahmed's edited volume, as is not unusual in books made up of a collection of writings, is constituted of essays of uneven quality. a few illuminate, others are rather humdrum, and disappoint in the context of the subject matters they deal with. in the end, in some cases, one would have to look really hard to find any complexity, and the expectancy that could well be aroused by a glance at the title woman and militancy might turn out to be a damp squib.
travelling back to a war
the book is an excellent personal account of the 1971 liberation war of bangladesh by dr nurun nabi. it offers a remarkable first-hand view of the freedom struggle from the author's personal experiences as a freedom fighter. the book distinguishes itself from other works by providing a vast canvas ranging from the author's early childhood days to his participation in the freedom struggle.
no wisdom, but nuggets anyway . . .
edward kennedy's death more than a year ago was cause for the celebration, in a manner of speaking, of a dynasty that yet exercises a hold on the public imagination. it does not really matter that the dynasty, as it used to be, does not happen to be there any more. that the mystique of the kennedys has become frayed over the years is no more in question. but, again, there is that certain reawakening of sensibilities, of memories, every time the kennedys are mentioned. that explains the grandeur of edward kennedy's funeral. the fact that he was the only kennedy brother to survive to ripe old age (he was seventy seven when he passed on) did little to stop the flow of a revival of popular interest in the clan. the obamas and the clintons and the bushes and the carters made sure, through their presence at kennedy's memorial services in boston, that the clan was remembered.
