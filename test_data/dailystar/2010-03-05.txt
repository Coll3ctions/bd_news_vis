trial of war criminals
the government has taken a hard line in order to implement one of their most talked about election pledges, namely the trial of war criminals. they seem to be very definitive and focused on what they are doing. a road had to be taken, and in my view this is the right one, regardless of what a section of people is saying against it. the trial of the people who committed crimes against humanity is close at hand. it is time we closed all our old and open wounds and moved forward. each and everyone, despite his/her differences in ideology, should keep a safe distance from the people who committed crimes like killing, rape, looting and arson during 1971.
price hike
day by day, price has been increasing without any kind of reason and exceeding the limits of tolerance. poor people are suffering so much because they do not earn much. the prices of rice, soybean oil, sugar, pulses, onion etc are increasing day by day.
renaming zia
it is with deep resentment that i am writing this. i am not sure what kind of development ideology lies in renaming everything that was named by the earlier administration. if the al believes in real development and empowerment of the masses, they should rather focus on more urgent issues than renaming the international airport. in defence, they may say that they did not name it as bangabandhu airport or something like that. but that's not the point. the point is when there are so many issues the government has to deal with, their efforts in renaming the establishments indicate that they are not using their time very wisely.

hilary clinton's speech
i fortunately had a chance to watch united states foreign secretary hilary clinton's powerful speech live in the tv (al zajeera channel), which she gave at u.s. islamic forum, lately in doha. once again, she deliberately announced that respect for women should be ensured.
road safety
a man works hard. but for what? he wants to pass a secure life. would we ever get that? once we go out of the house, it seems we are walking on the death trap. in the footpath muggers wait for us and in the road, motor vehicles wait for us. if we enter into our house remaining alive, we do not find a jolly mood. like air pollution, sound pollution is also a serious problem now. did we ever try to find out any solution?
“enough is enough”
this refers to the article of feb. 12 with the above title by zafar sobhan.
nasty politics
our political game is slowly but steadily entering into the confrontation phase like end october 2006. the fallout of that is already known to us.
extortion
extortion is the order of the day. in zia international airport, railway stations, bus stands, at tender submission and even in the kitchen markets.
think about future
i am not an expert on bangladeshi constitution but there should be a strict regulation on explaining detailed consequence of every decision being made in financial terms. so that at any point of time in the future someone can be held responsible for the decision they make. because at the end of the day all these come down to numbers / money which does not grow on trees. as they are elected (censored) honourable members of parliament perhaps they have now statutory authority to make whatever (censored) decisions they find reasonable. but we live in the era of information technology and we want precise detail of how much money is being spent in the "child play" of name changing. they are walking the same road as they did when they went to power last time so the consequence they will have to face again is apparent to all. you can not gain popularity by playing the blame game and expecting that people would love to indulge in the past when they have burning hunger which makes people recite "vat day haramzada na hoi manchitro khabo".
