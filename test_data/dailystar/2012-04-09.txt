senseless violence
last week i was privileged to be one of the foreign friends to be awarded the friends of liberation war honour for the work i did in 1971 coordinating provision of assistance to about 600,000 refugees in indian refugee camps. we experienced a beautifully arranged 3-day programme for which the various ministries involved should be strongly applauded and the ministers and staff of these ministries should feel proud for what they organised in our honour.
power and darkness
the democratic norm of taking responsibility for any shortcoming and resigning position by ministers and advisers is unknown in our “democracy of the opportunist and for the opportunist." they are voted to power by the gullible public (voters), in the hope of better things to come!
rising prices of medicines
over the last few months the prices of different medicines have risen considerably. surely it is an alarming trend that will affect the common people. the existing healthcare system is too expensive for the poor and the low income citizens.
bad behaviour in parliament
wherever bad behaviour in parliament is serious, democracy itself is threatened as it depends on people being able to talk (parler = french for 'to talk') and one cannot talk with those out of control.
murder of trayvon martin
recently a black teen american trayvon martin was shot dead by george zimmerman, a hispanic in florida. thousands of americans registered their strong protest against the killing of trayvon who was unarmed. they demanded immediate arrest of zimmerman and his trial. since the unfortunate incident took place, racial discrimination existing between black and white skinned americans once again came into public talk. turning the racially charged case into a personal matter, the first black us president barack obama said - "if i had a son, he'd look like trayvon" he assured trayvon's parents that proper justice will be done while dealing with the case.
'sorry' is enough?
in spite of knowing the identity of a university teacher, the rab personnel beat him up a few days ago. now they say 'sorry' and ensure 'investigation' into the 'unexpected incident' (ds: 01.04.12). every cautious citizen of the country knows the fate of the so-called 'investigation' in the end. so, we demand immediate and exemplary action against those who arrogantly make excesses so that others don't dare to commit such offences; otherwise the society will never be corrected.
no one cares!
we are one of the most unfortunate nations to have two political parties who are busy about their own business and not ours. our government is busy with the war crimes trial, and 'improving' relations with india. often, they forget important matters like electricity, water and fuel crisis, environment degradation, inflation, and the list continues.
is it professionalism?
the bcb's request to investigate the incident that happened at the final over took the shine away from the nail-biting asia cup finals. we will always be proud to the fact that the tigers went down roaring by failing to overcome a minor deficit of two runs to victory. but the appeal was criticised by everyone as it seemed to be an unprofessional act and that it also showed the world that we are quite stubborn to accept the reality yet.
victorious in defeat
bangladesh cricket team may not have won the asia cup, but they have won the hearts of millions around the world. we think it is an immense reward; it is more precious than the trophy. the cricketers have made us very proud and extremely happy, our heartiest congratulations to them.
