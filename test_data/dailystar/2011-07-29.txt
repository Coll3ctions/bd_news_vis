hsc results are satisfying
with 75.08 per cent of students emerging successful at this year's hsc examinations, it appears that education at that level is on course in the country. the number of those who have achieved gpa-5 is higher than previously, which of course convinces many that the standard of education has gone up. additionally, a remarkable degree of efficiency has come into the preparation, tabulation and announcement of the results. where earlier it took the authorities ninety days to make the results known, this time that period has been slashed to fifty-seven. we therefore congratulate the authorities. and, of course, our heartiest congratulations go out to the successful candidates. they have earned their laurels.

diminishing returns
like the alumni of a cash-strapped college, ethnic south asians living abroad are constantly being pestered to fork out a bit for the dear old place. after all, south asia remains poor, and they, collectively, are loaded. according to a 2009 estimate, indians, pakistanis, bangladeshis, sri lankans and nepalis living abroad were worth $1 trillion, with another guess the following year suggesting that non-resident indians own a further $500m-worth of gold, property and art. the hope has long been that the south asian diaspora might do for the region back home what the overseas chinese did for china and pour in investment to fuel rapid growth. a first-ever “south asian diaspora convention” held this week in singapore had an even more ambitious aim: to use overseas south asians to foster regional economic integration.

save the country, join the fight
we are sadly observing that some people of the government are cutting trees, forcefully buying the land of poor farmers to build apartments, erasing hills and grabbing rivers. both print and electronic media are trying to draw the attention of the government to take immediate action against such harmful activities going on in broad daylight. but none of the ministries concerned is taking any effective measure to stop this (except some eyewash). reports have so far revealed that in most of the cases people of the government parties (both previous and present) are involved with such heinous activities. that is why after the independence we had ministers of al, bnp and jp, but we did not have a minister of bangladesh. they helped the corrupt and so-called powerful people but not the common people.
how will commoners survive?
people of our country are suffering a chronic price rise of the essential commodities. the price of rice has gone up and also we will have shortage of sugar, oil, and other commodities in the coming ramadan days. the same will happen in the case of vegetables. the government is trying to achieve a name in the global scenario, but in fact it is forgetting its role in the country. they could not control the price hike in the last one year. the government says it will monitor the market during ramadan, but people's speculation is that this move will fail badly as happened in the past years. at the same time, the bus fare, rickshaw fare- all are increasing very rapidly. how will common people survive?

osd
nowadays, the most pathetic situation the bcs cadres face is becoming an osd, which happens with the change of the political regime, as still now neutral civil administration system could not be established due to political interference. consequently, career of many brilliant officers are being hampered and we noticed that some osd officers even committed suicide being insulted with this status, though they served the nation for a long time. in fact, political affiliation is the prime cause for this situation because the political govt. always wants to politicize the total administration. according to the experts, impartial and neutral civil administration is indispensable for the continuous development of a country while the label of osd on the bcs cadres bar the propagation of development. considering the bright prospect and future of the country, political govt. should stop this harsh step with a view to punishing the civil servants. we, the people of all walks of life, want to see a better bangladesh through the active participation of all bcs cadres.

it is very saddening that we are still long way off establishing the supremacy of rule of law which is the panacea for our ills. most students opt for administrative positions in the bcs examination not because they want to serve the country but because those positions will give them all that we wish for as respectable citizens-security, honor and immunity from punishment for corruption and crime. our society has fetish for pomp and power. the cold war between dcs and sps is the result of that sentiment created by unbridled undue wielding of power. during the up election presiding officers had to sit for the double training program -- one led by dcs and other by sps. as a presiding officer i had to suffer the heavy-handedness on the part of the policemen that was allotted for me. policemen's interference in my conduction of election got on my nerve but i bore it patiently thinking that my protest would aggravate the situation; my honor and position would then grovel under the boot. i know a long standing humiliation has taken away my capacity to boldly straddle the world like a horse but i feel emboldened seeing the weak and unconscious raise their heads all around me. wait, we are coming to correct the wrong!
sufferings of pedestrians
a few months back, all of a sudden in a fine morning, dmp prevented all rickshaws plying from malibag intersection to segun bagicha area saying that this was a vip road. in protest of that order, people instantly brought out a violent procession and vandalized many vehicles. then dmp authority said, "actually, police was rehearsing how to ease the traffic congestion." but then again, on july 20, 2011 dmp police repeated the same thing ignoring the sufferings of women, children, aged and ailing people. as a regular office goer i witnessed these sufferings and altercations with traffic police. moreover, ramadan is coming; even for a healthy fasting person it is tiresome to return home on foot in summer afternoons. i urge upon the dmp authorities to find out an alternative to mitigate the sufferings of the people of these areas.
