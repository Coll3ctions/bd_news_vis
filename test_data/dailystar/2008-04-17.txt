cec's paradoxical stand on talks with the bnp
the chief election commissioner has, as we understand, invited the two factions of the bangladesh nationalist party to tea today, separately of course. in light of the fact that earlier he ruled out the possibility of inviting both factions of the party to a dialogue, this is encouraging news. we, however, feel that the election commission should issue formal invitations to both factions to the dialogue it has initiated with the political parties. given that the caretaker government itself has initiated a move to talk to the delwar-led group as well as the pro-reform faction of the party, the stand adopted by atm shamsul huda smacks of a paradox. the point is simple: if the government can go for a political dialogue with both groups, what prevents the election commission from doing the same to ensure smooth elections? besides, it must be remembered that the roots of the present problem regarding the bnp lie in the earlier, obviously ill-considered move by the ec to invite the pro-reform faction of the bnp to the talks. it was that move which led to the present impasse; and the cec cannot absolve himself or his colleagues over their role in the making of the crisis. it was a mistake which the cec is yet to acknowledge.

nepal elections: surprise winner!
the stunning showing by the ultra-left maoists in nepal's historic elections may have surprised many, but their resounding success is being seen as a kind of logical development for changes towards a "new nepal" that attracted the ordinary voters. a variety of promises, highlighted by drastic economic and social reforms along with a tough anti-monarchy stance, helped them win the hearts of the masses in a country where the throne ruled for long and conventional political parties failed to deliver when they were at the helm. the final result has not been announced, but indications are clear that the once dreaded radicals will be in the driving seat in changing political dynamics.
