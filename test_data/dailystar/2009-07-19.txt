it is quite mind-boggling that one of the most important ministries of the government should be without a minister for such a long time. both the minister and state minister for home have been absent from office, the minister having suffered a broken hip, and her deputy being away on leave since 9th june. to make matters worse the pm, who had been looking after the ministry in the interregnum, was out of the country to egypt and has just returned. we are not aware whether someone was given the charge of looking after the home ministry during her absence. moreover, given the pm's commitment, we wonder if she can give the attention that the ministry deserves.

aging shishu park
due to its affordable costs and exiting rides, shahbagh's shaheed zia shishu park was once a famous hang out place for dhakaitees. maintained by dhaka city corporation, this park was a buzzing place for teenagers and adults alike. but those golden days of shishu park are gone by with the passage of time. now dhaka has a good number of parks which are maintained by private enterprises and these parks are way better than the shishu park in terms of rides and all other facilities. moreover, we have now water parks as well in our country like the developed countries. so i think people of bangladesh are not deprived of getting their desired entertainment options since we have no dearth of entertainment parks. but the high cost of these privately run parks does not encourage lower class people and even the middle class people can hardly go to these parks. so generally shishu park is still the only source of entertainment for majority of lower and middle-income people. but the age-old rides and run down vehicles of shishu park hardly attract the visitors nowadays. dhaka city corporation is neglecting to allocate the required budget for shishu park from the very beginning and hence the same age old 12 rides without any renovation have been frustrating the visitors for a long time. several projects for development and renovation of the park couldn't be implemented in the past ten years due to bureaucratic tangles. but kudos must be given to the persons who are constantly maintaining the age old rides of the shishu park. the sheer hard work of the maintenance staffs of shishu park is responsible for no major accidents from these run down rides. but things should not go this way. it has been heard that by the end of this year, some new rides will be added to shishu park and the park will be renovated. but so far no indication in this regard has been revealed by the people concerned. dhaka city corporation must wake up and take the appropriate measures to improve the sorry state of shishu park without further ado before it's too late. the frustration of common people for lack of government run entertainment park will be worsened if the authorities concerned do not pay heed to improving the condition of the shishu park. people have the right to have affordable entertainment and the government definitely should not neglect this issue of importance.

reflections on life
as a life-long resident of dacca/dhaka city, life in 2009 is different to me: we cannot find and engage a maidservant [bua]--not available! decades ago, i remember about the maidservants we exported from dacca to calcutta [@rs ten pm] they also acted as dai (nurse) to the children in the household; who later grew up and married and the maid was allowed a pension after retirement!
