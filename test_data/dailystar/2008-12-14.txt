martyred intellectuals' day
it is that time of year when we remember some of the bravest sons and daughters of the soil who made the supreme sacrifice in order to ensure the liberation of bangladesh. in december 1971, only days away from freedom, the bengali nation lost a whole group of its intellectuals to the murderous onslaught of the pakistan occupation army and its local collaborators, the razakars, al-badr and al-shams. between 12 and 14 december, perhaps even later, our doctors, academics, civil servants and journalists were picked up by these forces and then systematically picked off. their sinister objective was clear: an emerging bangladesh was to be left maimed so that it could not realise the full meaning of liberty. the occupation army and its collaborators were clearly on the run, but along the way they sought to inflict as much damage as they could on this freedom-loving nation.

everyday hazards
we are surrounded by hazards, that we are not aware of. we risk our ear-drums and even our limbs, as we go along with our daily lives, unaware of these dangers around us. one is the hazard from continuous high level noises; and the other is the unforgiving shiny floor, which can damage our bones and limbs! these unsafe environments, we take for granted without realising the potential danger to our health.
