begum zia must not prejudge delhi outcome
we are distressed by the tone and tenor of begum khaleda zia's remarks at paltan maidan on friday. the bnp leader has in effect held out a good number of threats and warnings at the government with regard to prime minister sheikh hasina's forthcoming official visit to india. the leader of the opposition has made it clear that if, in her opinion, the prime minister concludes an honourable deal in delhi, she will be welcomed home with garlands; but if, again in her words, she fails to preserve the national interest, her path once she returns home will be strewn with thorns. such remarks are plainly and disturbingly abrasive and certainly do little to help either the opposition or those it presumes to speak for.
highway journey extremely hazardous
the frequency at which highway accidents are taking place in the country has reached an ominous proportion. but the glaring fact remains that there is no authority around to monitor and regulate the speed, fitness as well as overloading of buses and trucks to bring the rate of such accidents down. as a result, bus and private car passengers are paying with their lives for such apathy, for such lack of concern, on the part of the administration, which is extremely lamentable, to say the least. as recent as last friday, a speeding passenger bus crashed into a roadside tree when it lost control while giving way to a truck coming from the opposite direction on the dhaka-khulna highway. the accident left 17 dead and many more injured. it is only likely that if the drivers of both the vehicles had any respect for human lives and fear for the law of the land, they would have been more careful while driving heavy vehicles on highways.

we should not miss the train
one wonders why the taliban are committing suicide in the name of the muslims by destroying educational institutions in the lawless region of pakistan. the signal given to the global community by such wanton acts of terrorism is that islam has compressed in its the holy book the ultimate knowledge necessary for mankind and no further knowledge is required, an impression that contradicts one of the fundamental teachings of islam -- instructing muslims to go to china (a far away place in the seventh century), if necessary, to seek knowledge.
ushering in the new year
the year 2009 has passed away in the eternal flow of time with all its glories and ignominies. although all the years are equal in the scale of time, some years are more memorable than others, either for heights of achievements or for depth of miseries. the year 2009 will be remembered in bangladesh as the year of hope and introspection. view the page sports

climate change
now we need not be an astrologer or quote a reference from a holy scripture to predict a doomsday when the earth will permanently collapse and all living beings will become extinct. today science forecasts a doomsday that might come in a few years because of global warming and climate change. there is no doubt that human existence will be threatened if the earth gets warmer at present rate.
powerless city!
load shedding has been a common scene in dhaka city as far back as i can remember. with passage of time it went from bad to worse. and the government keeps making promise of reducing it. but the more they promise, the worse it gets. ever since i learned to read the newspaper, every other day i would see talks of new power plants, ways to reduce power consumption and increase production. the government allocates more and more money each year to the power sector, but to no use. and during the elections, every party makes pledges of improvement in the power sector. but clearly, somebody has been sleeping on the job.
cadet colleges
i read with interest the article captioned 'yes, cadet colleges do serve national interest' by ekram kabir (ds-24 december). while agreeing with his observations and view points i would like to add a few points. there are pains and gains in the cadet college education. the pain part is that a very tender boy/girl is removed from household, from natural parental care and love and pressed into a challenging situation. the gain starts from there on. the same boys are more disciplined, confident, hard working, take initiatives, 'doer' and achievers in military, civil services, public sectors, business, industries etc. it is the training and rigorous discipline which make all the difference. for the growth and development of a nation and country such discipline is required.

the other night i was watching a touchy live show on desh tv which was participated by son, daughters of late celebrated singer mahmudun nabi. like some previous shows on the mini screen, it reminded us that the late melodious singer mahmudun nabi during his lifetime had never been given due recognition of his outstanding talent, and his contributions to bengali music. mahmudun nabi's songs are very popular among both the young and the old generations.
g m quader's article
the article of gm quader published in the daily star on 23 december 2009 drew my attention. i highly appreciate and entirely support his meticulous views. he appropriately depicted that some so-called terrorist organisations in the name of freedom movement try to destabilize the regional peace, even unpopular to their own people. he also rightly gave the indication of bangladesh's position that the country is no more a safe heaven for terrorists. bangladeshis are peace-loving people, they never support any exaggeration in the name of religion or freedom of movement. mr. quader rightly mentioned “...it is, therefore, an insult to our war of independence to compare it with the wanton attacks perpetrated by many of the terrorist groups of our region when innocent people, even women and children, fall prey.” i also support his idea how we can take advantage of india's education system and medical facilities. in this regard, we can clearly mention that india has to spend lots of money for countering terrorism activities in its land. and bangladesh saves its huge expenditure by not harbouring its ulfa and other terrorist organisations.
illegal fines?
byron's front-page lead news published in your december 23 issue is a new surprising twist! were the members of the caretaker government so ignorant that they ignored this very vital legal issue? what has the adviser then in charge of the law portfolio, got to say about it?
great improvement!
in my sixty years of life, i have joined the city's main eid congregation at national eidgah during eid-ul -fitr & eid-ul -azha many a time. i am well accustomed to the poor arrangement of dhaka city corporation at the national eidgah.
bnp and tarique
the bnp was born to oppose the al. they are doing so and would continue as long as they do not adopt a policy of cooperation in practice, rather than as a rhetoric. with mr tarique rahman taking over the bnp, as it looks like, i am becoming very concerned whether the bnp will ever come out of the most restricted security zone. the issue is now low profile due to the intervention of the court of law. this is an issue one should think about. if mr tarique rahman continues to practise politics living in the same cantonment house, the situation might be different from what it was during khaleda zia's days.
the chevron issue
this is surprising to see that the daily star (ds) has apparently decided to remain on the sidelines on the subject which is the talk of the town at the moment the chevron scandal (?). for years, we are subscribing ds for authentic news. this is now unfortunate that we have to look for other newspapers on this developing story, which allegedly has the involvement of many stakeholders. this is particularly disappointing because on matters related to energy sector, the ds has been the leading newspaper for more than a decade now. for some reasons, it has now decided to remain quiet. even if it has some compelling reasons to do so, it can at least inform its readers whether chevron was awarded the contract in question outside any tender procedure or not. an honest answer to this simple question will answer many other related questions that the ds may decide not to deal with at this stage.
our reply
from february 2009, the daily star has published at least 10 stories along with in-depth information on the gas compressor issue - from cancellation of the tender for installation of gas compressors by petrobangla's ex-chairman to awarding a contract to chevron questionably. the last story in this regard came out on october 27.
ff certificate
our independence was achieved by the blood of millions of people. our brave boys didn't show any kind of stinginess in sacrificing their lives to save our motherland. we don't have any accurate statistical data that tell us exactly how many people lost their lives during the liberation war. the most regrettable issue is, till now, we are not able to identify the number of original freedom fighters who directly participated in the liberation war. many of them are now working as rickshaw-pullers or beggars. on the other hand, some people who were convicted as “rajakar” at that time are now claiming themselves to be freedom fighters by collecting fake freedom fighter certificates.

stuck here on earth
currently, humankind is set in motion to create history, and what is history, indeed, but a record of change? the guided principle behind this history is none other than climate change. the world today is a much warmer place than it used to be in the last century and this rate of warming is unprecedented, even going back millions of years. the sea levels are rising, even small changes in the sea level have large effects; for example: a one metre rise in the sea level will claim 15-20% land from the southern parts of bangladesh, maldives will go under and other small island states, coastal communities and low-lying areas of the world will fall to a similar fate.
the polluter pays principle
the last few months has seen startling news headlines on river pollution and a momentous high court directive given on june 25, 2009 to save ecologically critical rivers surrounding dhaka. another high court directive was given to the tannery industry to expedite its relocation to savar, where they will be allowed to operate using central effluent treatment plants (cetps) to reduce the impact of their effluents on surrounding water bodies. more and more, we see an emphasis on making the polluters accountable for the ecological damage they are causing to themselves and to their future generations. indeed, holding the current economic drivers accountable for environmental damage is also at the heart of bangladesh's climate change demands. however, looking for environmental responsibility as a piecemeal initiative (e.g. separate hc directives noted above) may be a beginning, but we need to think of it within a broader framework. it is time bangladesh addresses pollution management, financing and cost recovery by rethinking the current modes of operation employed by the regulatory stakeholders in line with the opportunities presented within the full cost recovery options using polluter and user pays principles.
electrification through biogas
bangladesh still remains an agrarian country. because of increasing population growth, the amount of per capita cultivable land is dwindling very fast. in order to survive as a nation, and to prosper in the 21st century, bangladesh will have to shift from an agrarian economy to an industrial one. consequently, power generation will have to increase substantially to achieve that goal and measures to achieve countrywide transmission coverage should be initiated on a priority basis. electricity is an essential pre-requisite for technological progress and economic growth. bangladesh has been facing a severe power crisis for about a decade. currently, power generation in the country is almost entirely dependent on natural gas (i.e. 84.5% of total electricity generation installed capacity). at the current 10% annual rate of growth of consumption, the proven reserve of natural gas may not last more than the next 10-15 years. electrification of villages in remote areas usually requires large investment and leads to power losses associated with transmission and distribution networks.
reawakening
each year marks a milestone in the march of time, and every year, we in south asia, never fail to recall the anniversary of our triumph over colonialism, and somewhat less jubilantly, a historic but bitter partition. beyond this truly liberating experience, the rewards of freedom would appear to have eluded the children of liberty. quarter of a century onward, predictably enough, we opted to repeat history, with undiminished ferocity. what was once considered "the jewel in the crown" of the empress of india, fragmented into india, pakistan, and better late than never, bangladesh. in the first instance, it was the largest mass migration in history, and in the latter, yet another chapter in the continuing saga of mass murder. in both instances, millions were massacred in the name of language, geography, ideology, economics, politics and above all, god.
