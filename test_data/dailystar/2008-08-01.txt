truth and accountability commission
the much-vaunted, though not necessarily much-coveted, truth and accountability commission has come into being. it has onerous responsibility to prove its efficacy, not just because the experiment is getting underway in the country for the first time with no experience to fall back on but also owing to the huge load of mercy petitions it will have to dispose of without undermining the integrity of the justice system in any way.
deportation of bangladeshi workers unacceptable
the crisis resulting from the agitation by bangladeshi workers in kuwait has clearly taken a turn for the unsavoury. with the kuwaiti authorities deporting as many as a hundred of the workers, with the very real possibility of more such workers being forced to come back home, matters get extremely awkward for relations between the two countries. conditions ought not to have come to such a pass, given that the workers, at their wits' end, were only agitating for better wages and living conditions in the state. as far as issues of this kind go, it should have been the responsibility of kuwait to look into the workers' grievances and so prevent the crisis from taking a bigger shape. that has unfortunately not been done. and what is certainly unacceptable now is the deportation measure.

income generating projects
people wanted more relief after sidr hit our coastal areas. now they are looking for work instead of relief. i have been working with the biggest national ngo in their relief and rehabilitation programme in sidr affected areas since december 2007.
homeless people
homeless people living on footpaths was a common sight in dhaka. we saw them at kamalapur railway station and in many places at night. but after the caretaker government took charge of the country, the scene radically changed. the number of homeless people increased manifold. now i see them everywhere in dhaka. the other day when i was crossing the street in mirpur at about 12:00pm, a middle-aged woman was sleeping there on the island. any time i pass through karwan bazar, in front of prothom alo office i see people sleeping or lying on the footpaths. if i make a list of the places where every day i see these floating people, it won't end. we all know what happened, these people were evicted from slums where they had been living illegally! they can't manage their two meals daily and this eviction added to their sufferings.

generate solar power
it is very unfortunate that in spite of having three elected governments and 15 years of democracy in the country, none of the parties who were in power had invested in the power sector. rather, they have consumed the power from the power generation units to fulfil their individual needs on different occasions. the outcome is - we all get to share the limited power supplies which the country still generates.
decentralisation
the regime of autocrat president ershad was a dark chapter of our political history, no doubt, but his initiative to introduce 'decentralisation' was a praise-worthy move. everything is in dhaka, but that cannot bring about optimum benefits for the country. everyone is rushing towards dhaka for job, education, business, marketing etc. and so, dhaka is now on the verge of death. other regions of the country are underdeveloped to a great extent. now it is high time to rethink the matter seriously for the country's benefit.
why so many parties?
politics is growing like business. it is a matter of regret that there are 62 political parties, including 22 religion-based ones in our country, but these parties are not functioning smoothly. why should we have so many political parties?

the long cherished hope of electing honest and dedicated persons as people's representatives to the national and local bodies/ institutions is going to remain a far cry. this has become evident from the list of the candidates who got nominations and were accepted by the ec for different posts in the upcoming city corporations and pourashava elections. in khulna city corporation (kcc) mayoral & ward commissioner candidacy, 13 are facing allegations of corruption and criminal activities. in sylhet city corporation mayoral election, three candidates are accused of similar crimes. the scene is not different for the other two city corporations i.e. barisal and rajshahi. mostly incumbent ward commissioners belonging to two major political parties (a few of them were even convicted & now out on bail) are seeking to be elected again. recently, the cec even expressed frustration as very few good people came forward to participate in the polls.
what's going on?
what is going on even during the period of interim non-political government? the cabinet is taking decisions transparently but the ministry officials are adamant and that's why most of the projects got stuck, whatever be the situation or public interest & necessity.
policy shift needed
as high rate of inflation and escalating unemployment have seized the public life in bangladesh, it is now our grave concern to survive through this crisis. so, considering the changed circumstances and the global context of food crisis, we feel the need for broad scale policy shift by the government that will ensure foods, social security and employment in the long run.

extra-judicial killing
another murder in the name of crossfire? this man could have been your son, brother, nephew or even father. but he gets no justice because the state has decided to kill him, as long as the victim is not your relative, you might be thinking the act of crossfire is a great way to get rid of criminals? well, i do not know who are criminals and who are not unless they face the judicial system. let them have their day in the court and punish them according to the law of the land.
judges seek justice
ten aggrieved judges of the hc appealed to uphold their right to get confirmation of their appointment as judges of the hc. they have won the first round based on the judgment of the hc. now the 19 sitting judges of the hc have moved an appeal in the sc to uphold their seniority.
taxpayer's appeal
please allow me to share the view expressed and appeal made by mr. abdullah syed. i am in a similar situation, and in my case i did not have the opportunity to submit my tax returns from 2003 to 2007 since i was abroad doing my doctorate degree during that period.
freedom fighters' quota
the much talked about topic these days is quota system in government services. as i am a candidate of 28th bcs, the matter haunts me all the while. so i am expressing my personal view here again.
where are those candidates?
the cec recently said he is disappointed that good people will not be participating in the municipal polls. and the chief adviser has appealed to the people to elect good candidates. now, where will they get good candidates?
costly maintenance!
well done bttb. you have got front-page coverage after quite some time in the most widely circulated english daily of the country for your unholy acts(news item - the ds, 22nd july,08). you should be grateful to acc task force for this. their relentless digging to unearth your misdeeds over the years resulted in this "honour" being conferred upon you. who cares about shame, stigma etc? those were old schools of thought. taka 6 lakh for maintenance of each car is nothing. after all, don't these mechanical transports require maintenance? money is no problem. taxpayers are there. so, money had to be spent to keep each vehicle flawless, spotless, shinning, so that bttb officers' children, grandchildren, friends, relatives, in-laws did not have to face slightest bit of embarrassment while riding in cars. now you have a worthy successor btcl. they have reduced the number of cars by 22%. a remarkable achievement indeed! we see old wine in new bottle with an old stopper at the top. wish you all the best btcl. view the page international
