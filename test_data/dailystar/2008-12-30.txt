landslide mandate
the awami league-led grand alliance has swept back to power after seven years out of office with a stunning landslide victory in an environment of free and fair elections that clearly showed the people's verdict for a change and has consigned the bnp-led four-party alliance to the political wilderness.
rigging, forgery in 72 seats
the bnp has complained that there were irregularities, ballot rigging and forgery in 220 poll centres in 72 constituencies across the country during the just concluded ninth parliamentary election.
you shall reap as you sow
as we celebrate the majesty of public will and try to understand the stunning results of the national election 2008, the real question that needs to be asked is not why awami league won so comprehensively, but why bnp got the thrashing that it did. given our anti-incumbency history and the pattern so far followed since 1991, it can be considered somewhat natural that awami league should get a turn to run the country in 2008, after bnp did so in 2001.
bnp at lowest ebb
it is a shock-and-awe rout for the bnp, once a mighty party.
trial in people's court
it was a quick trial in people's court and the verdict was simple and clear with a message attached to it. it said it is the masses that hold the ultimate power in a republic. and it is they who break down the doors of bastille again and again whenever tyrant rulers and their henchmen make feeble attempts to hide inside. history tells us that the despots have never been forgiven by the people.
out, bigwigs
it was an election of heartbreak and humiliation for many bigwigs. an election that clearly brought home that big names do not matter, it is the deeds that count at the end of the day.
don't underestimate the public
once again, the bangladeshi voters have demonstrated that it is best to never underestimate them. once again they have delivered a verdict as clinical as it has been mature, and shown that when they are able to exercise their franchise without fear for their safety they are able to render decisive and critical judgments.
graft, food price throw bnp out
corruption and high price of essentials were the major deciding factors for voters while casting ballots in the just concluded ninth parliamentary election.
women cruise to a historic high
highest 18 women have won 22 parliamentary seats in monday's battle of ballots, meaning the new parliament will have the highest number of at least 63 female lawmakers, including 45 to be elected to reserve seats, in the history of bangladesh.
dejection, delight
the contrast couldn't get more startling. as the bnp media centre at the chairperson's gulshan office lay forlorn, roars of joy and pinching to make sure it wasn't all a dream reflected the mood of awami league-led grand alliance camp.
highest turnout
the turnout in ninth parliamentary election is the highest ever in the history of bangladesh with little possibility of fake votes having been cast due to the new system with a voter roll that had photographs to confirm one's identity.
no scope of rejecting results
chief election commissioner (cec) atm shamsul huda has said there would be no scope for any quarter to reject the results of the ninth parliamentary election.
call for calm
awami league (al) president sheikh hasina last night urged her party men to stay calm and not to bring out any victory processions until the polls results are announced officially.
jamaat in checkmate
the anti-liberation forces have been defeated once again, this time through peoples' verdict. while it is a sweet revenge for bangladeshis against the war criminals, the verdict will make stronger the demand for their trial.
ca delighted over high turnout
chief adviser (ca) fakhruddin ahmed yesterday expressed the hope that the political parties would gracefully accept the results of the ninth parliamentary polls.
first vote for fresh hope
fired with enthusiasm, the first time voters representing almost one-fourth of around 81 millions on the electoral roll exercised their franchise with the hope of a positive attitude in leaders of the ninth parliament.
ctg minority voters brave intimidation
minority voters in different areas in chittagong received threats from workers of the four-party alliance despite huge preparations and safety measures for a free and fair election.
mismanagement mars voter list success
thousands of voters in the capital could not vote yesterday despite repeated frantic attempts, due to an apparent mismanagement of the much ballyhooed successful voter list by the election commission (ec).
victory for sector commanders
a year-long nationwide campaign to try war criminals culminated in an overwhelming vote of confidence for the sector commanders' forum yesterday, as their chief ak khandakar and rafiqul islam swept to victory last night as part of the al-led grand electoral alliance.
nizami's ex-ps caught red-handed
at least eight workers of jamaat-e-islami including a former personal secretary of its ameer motiur rahman nizami were arrested in pabna while 15 workers of bnp and jatiya party were held in three other districts for distributing money among voters yesterday.
8th and 9th js polls in comparison

biharis embark on new era
it was a watershed day yesterday for the biharis in bangladesh as for the first time since independence they cast votes in a general election here.
one killed in polls violence
one person was killed and over 50 others were injured in election-related violence across the country during yesterday's ninth parliamentary elections.
amu, inu first time lawmakers
two seasoned political figures -- awami league (al) presidium member amir hossain amu and jatiya samajtantrik dal (jsd) chief hasanul haq inu -- yesterday won in a parliamentary election for the first time.
voting well organised
eu chief election observer alexander lambsdorff yesterday said political parties should accept the elections if results are credible.
al surges ahead
half way into the election results, the al-led grand alliance has taken a clear lead in the race, keeping ahead of its archrival bnp-led four-party in most constituencies. the grand alliance has already won in 19 seats and the four-party in five.

awami league scores a stunning victory
the awami league-led grand alliance has swept back to power in a stunning landslide victory that is as much a rejection of the bnp-led four-party alliance as it is an endorsement of the winners. the voters seized their day and made their voices ring out all over the land, loud and clear. once again, the bangladeshi electorate has demonstrated its maturity by discarding party loyalty and turning against a party in massive numbers for its failure in office and lack of vision for the future.
not just another election
on january 11, 2007 we embarked on a journey to nowhere and were beset with speculations and conjectures about where we were heading. amid a good deal of drama and experimentations with regard to our reformed political process, we only half believed, if at all, an election to be held before the year 2008 was out.
young voters in ballot battle

the secular vote bloc
standing at many intersections. what were the arguments in favour of secularism? in the 1960s, a push-back against west pakistani colonisation. in 1971, it was simply and joyfully, a decisive rejection of the pakistan model. later in the 1980s, it was also expanded to explain that religion was for private space, inner life, spiritual healing; but not for politics. now in this decade, we also insistently emphasise that religion is to be respected (because secularism's critics falsely accuse it of being anti-religion), but it should not be involved in the running of the state. view the page sports
