let us help poor survive winter
recently a weeklong cold wave has swept the country especially in the northern part of bangladesh. it has predominantly jeopardised the lives of the poor. we learn from the newspapers that many poor people died of various diseases caused by extreme cold. weather office is predicting another two or three cold waves to set off in upcoming january. it is in fact a bad news for the poor. there are many well-off people in our country. they can pass the winter happily with warm clothes. but the poor don't have the ability to do so.
power tariff hike
electricity price has again been raised at the consumer level by 21.2% in two phases. the energy regulatory commission has increased the price to tk 5.02 from tk 4.16 per unit. the retail price in the first phase is being raised by tk 0.55 per unit with retrospective effect from december 1. another hike of tk 0.31 will take place on february 1 next year. when people are smarting from sky-rocketing price of essentials and petroleum products, this fresh hike of power tariff is really very painful. the chairman of the energy regulatory commission said the increase in electricity would help the government save about tk 10 billion in annual subsidies. it is true that bangladesh is facing severe pressure on the economic front. the government has increased its bank borrowing heavily. the government is tired of providing subsidies to different service sectors. so, to reduce subsidies, the government has no way but to raise power price. but the government should also consider the plight of the common people.

to mark present government's three years in office, the daily star has started publishing evaluation-based reports on each day focusing on the performance of specific ministries under the title “three years of the government”. on december 27, 2011, it highlighted the performance of education ministry. under the title “education shines with success”, the reporter appropriately threw lights on different praiseworthy efforts of the ministry. but i am sorry to say that the minister is not giving his due attention to the national university (nu), the largest university (affiliated) of bangladesh. among many problems, the session jam ranks number one problem for which the students are to waste their valuable 3/4 year. we believe it is not an impossible task if the education minister handles the issue properly.

a rare example of democratic election
it is very appreciable that the election of bcs (agriculture) cadre was held in a democratic and peaceful atmosphere throughout bangladesh. the election campaign appeared credible, as both the candidates and the supporters were peaceful in nature and festive in mood. one group affirmed their election pledges while the other group did the same at the same venue and in front of the same gathering. democratic norms and values were observed at every phase of the election process such as during submission and withdrawal of the candidature, at the of electioneering campaign. the post-election occasion of congratulating the winner by the defeated candidates was also no exception. we, the people of bangladesh, can follow this as a model in our national election where candidates, voters and supporters will really act as friends of each other. will it remain a mere dream or would ever become a reality? we are optimistic and look forward to seeing the positive changes in this regard.
storage of winter clothes
how kind are the people who donate warm clothes and blankets to the poor for the winter season! but where do the poor keep them during the hot and wet season so that they are available for next winter and do not need the generosity to be repeated? are the ultra poor likely to have waterproof and insect-proof storage facilities? they also need the security that ensures the contents are not stolen or damaged - and get an airing once or twice. this needs not only people with space and time but the kindliness that does not shrink from direct contact with the ultra poor. in about 6 weeks' time, are there people who would approach particular poor people that they know and offer to care for blankets and clothing until the following winter - and be trusted to do so? i wish i found this easier to imagine… however, may be inspired people could develop a system and a team of sympathisers …and, surely, mosques, temples and churches with extra space could help …?
