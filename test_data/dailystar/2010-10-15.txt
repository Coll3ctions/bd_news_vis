boraigram murder
the prime minister and the rest of her government owe it to the nation to take the awami league lawmaker from the boraigram-gurudaspur constituency in natore to task for the outrageous remarks about the sanaullah noor babu murder he has just made. and with him, there are other natore al leaders who must be asked to explain why they resorted to such audacity day before yesterday, obviously as a way of telling the country that even if the supporters or members of the ruling party commit crimes, they can get away with it. the mp has asked his party men not to worry because nothing will come of the murder case and nothing will happen to the awami league. we wonder if the lawmaker and the other al figures in natore were aware of the repercus-sions of their remarks, made in public and with little of embarrassment.

vote for the sundarbans
a single natural gift may easily change the destiny of bangladesh. this is the sundarbans. for an international vacationer, a trip to bangladesh can never be complete without seeing the majestic sundarbans. being one of the most beautiful and pristine lands of beauty and charm, the sundarbans offers everything that a travel destination can provide. some of its special features are its evergreen flora, rare fauna, buzzing cruise, entertaining cultural life and unique local cuisine. with the lowest airfare in asia, it is now very easy for international travellers to reach the spot via dhaka and chittagong.
mission road safety
lots of people in bangladesh lose their lives in road accidents. but not a single checkpoint has been set up to identify the unfit vehicles and the reckless drivers. we import expensive motor vehicles. we should also import speed cameras to trace the wrongdoings of the drivers.
save our local birds
in bangladesh, there are many attractive species of birds. and in winter, numerous migratory birds come to bangladesh, as it is their favourite place. but it is a matter of great regret that local birds are now on the verge of extinction. some days ago, a leading daily reported that birds were being caught using traps at some places of north bengal.

for a golden bangladesh
what is the biggest hurdle towards our national progress? is it political instability, or corruption, or leadership crisis or a combination of all these? who is going to answer the question? the point i am trying to make is that we all should do our part. let's be hones and committed to performing our respective jobs.

news casting
recently, i watched a talk show in a tv channel where eminent newscasters shared their views. the basic requirements to be a newscaster, they say, is the look, personality, ability to present, smart in all senses, updated with everything around the world, and last but not the least, a capable person who can handle any unforeseen situation.
bus crisis
it is a matter of great distress that there are only 5 buses for nearly five thousand students of bangladesh agricultural university, and the last bus was bought at least 18 years ago. the engines of the buses stop in the middle of a journey all on a sudden. a serious accident may take place anytime. besides, it is hard to get on the buses, because outsiders, school and college students, also commute by these buses. female students are the worst sufferers. we request the authorities to take quick and effective measures to solve this problem.
animal slaughtering laws
most newspapers have reported on this new bill in their 5th october issue. it is an improvement of the act of 1983 on the matter. after all, we improve as we learn. hopefully, it will ensure that the unwary buyer gets quality meat free of diseases.
war on terror
as the so-called war on terror drags on in afghanistan and pakistan, many participants of the us-led coalition forces have left, and many have declared their intention of leaving. while any participating force can leave, pakistan is still stuck in the muddle, because gen. pervez musharraf's government initially gave the impression of open-ended engagement to gain international legitimacy, which is proving costly for the country.
assailed by unfortunate events
not a single day passes without some heart-wrenching news reaching us, it seems that death is lurking everywhere, in our homes, on the streets, in the rivers, on the railway tracks, and there is no end to it. numerous accidents are happening every day; in addition, murder, dacoity and arson have gone up alarmingly. people have become deeply frightened and very upset, as the future seems very bleak.
teachers from the minorities
may i request the honourable minister of education, as he plans the future workings of his department, to set up a small office, manned by officials who include those from minority racial and religious communities, with a well-advertised phone number, so that those school management, who are under pressure to dismiss non-muslim teachers, and non-muslim teachers, who are under pressure to resign - might contact such an office for support and advice.
a false case
it refers to my letter published in the daily star on september 6, 2010 entitled 'misery of an ordinary man', which described my plight under arrest warrant. meanwhile, my younger sister, aged 32 and a mother of three children, was brought to dhaka for treatment. she did not come to my residence because of the dreadful situation in my house due to frequent police raids. although my wife is a doctor, we could not help her. she died in my brother's residence. think about the plight of her three children whom she has left behind.

separation of religion and state
the israeli government's decision to make new citizens announce their loyalty to israel as a jewish state is a populist agenda of the hardliners. the amendment to the citizenship act, which will require all non-jews who wish to become israeli citizens to pledge allegiance to a "jewish and democratic" israel, is a move in part of a series of actions which create an atmosphere of segregation. since many new citizens will come from arab countries in the context of family unification, they should be asked precisely to declare that israel is legitimate.
