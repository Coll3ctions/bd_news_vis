icl and our cricket
bangladesh cricket was catapulted into world stage when they were just teething in 1998 and was producing competitive cricketers like aminul, akram, nannu, naimur rahman durjoy, rafique, pilot, bashar etc. lots of people opposed our entry into test cricket. but at that time it was a decision that had to be taken. after all, you may not get a man like dalmiya from kolkata as icc chief in the next 50 years. another good thing happened in the period 2002-2005. call him anything you like, but give the devil its due. arafat rahman koko, the former pm's son, became the chairman of development committee of cricket. he pumped in corporate funds to develop an under-19 squad that included mohammed ashraful, aftab ahmed, shahriyar nafees, mashrafe mortaza, shakib al hasan, shahdat hossain rajib, syed rasel and mehrab hossain jr. now they are all in the national side, aren't they? the guys who took the pains in creating all these greenhorns into internationals was an aussie coach, richard mcinnes. he had become the supplier of great talents like tamim, roquibul,abdur razzak, nazimuddin and others to be given the finishing by a seasoned whatmore and see what happened in the icc cup in the west indies. the coach is still grooming great guns like nayeem islam, suhrawardy shuvo, arafat sunny, zunaed siddique, ziaur rahman, shamsur rahman shuvo, nasir hossain, mahmudul hasan and so on. you will soon see them in the national odi and test squads.
