negligence to a project for disabled
it can only be termed as apathy on the part of the implementing agencies, and by implication, the ministry concerned that a 35-million dollar donor-funded project has not quite got off the ground. this appears even more disconcerting when one considers that the fund is to do with a project for the welfare of the disabled and for the disadvantaged children.
dr. wazed mia's passing
we mourn the passing away of dr. ma wazed miah. in his death, the country has lost not only a man of remarkable integrity but also a scientist of national as well as international repute. it is these two attributes which in his lifetime created for him the good reputation that in his death endures. noted for his academic and intellectual brilliance, wazed mia perhaps could have gone further than he did as a scientist. but the kind of man he was, maybe he did not quite feel that way about himself. the self-effacing about him was all.

kolkata knight riders
bollywood superstar shahrukh khan's team kolkata knight riders was undoubtedly the hugely promoted team of this year's ipl. after the drubbing of the last year, some people thought that this year kolkata knight riders would be perish the same way, because even before the start of the tournament, the team engaged itself in a big controversy as coach john buchanon wanted to introduce the multi-captain theory in cricket. moreover, the unfair treatment meted out to saurav ganguly raised many eyebrows and there was no team unity and team spirit visible under the captaincy of macculum. nevertheless, the hype and support for kolkata knight riders is understandable and people of bangladesh also joined in the knight riders (kkr) because of the inclusion of mashrafee mortaza. but all our hopes and expectations were simply shattered because even after losing match after match, the team management of kkr didn't bother to include mashrafee in the final eleven. they bought mashrafee at an unbelievable price of 6 million dollars and mashrafee is also at the pick of his form. so the reason why they are not including mashrafee in the playing eleven is indeed unclear. the bad treatment which our players like ashraful and mashrafee got from this year's ipl was unexpected and disappointing, to say the least.
human trafficking
trafficking is a serious crime and embodies many facets of human rights abuses. thousands of women and children are caught up in these criminal activities every year, causing them great harm. over recent years much has been written about the dynamics of trafficking, and many ambitious and well-intentioned statements of commitment to combating trafficking have been made in the international forums. but there is still a big gap between the cup and the lip. many countries are still lagging behind with regard to ensuring safety and security of their children and women. bangladesh is not an exception to this. criminals use bangladesh as a source of women and child trafficking. as an over-populated country, with a lot of people living below poverty line, it is easy for the human traffickers to lure poor, helpless child and women out of the country with the promise of better lives, work and future. but as we know, the promises end up in gruelling torture and sub-human work environment and in some cases death. to stop the crime, the government of bangladesh is committed to making a difference in the lives of women and children vulnerable to trafficking and this commitment is reflected in its various initiatives such as enacting laws suiting the needs of time, setting up high powered one stop crisis centre and multi-level monitoring cell and special courts for trying cases of such offences. vigilance has been reinforced in the international airports and seaports of the country. people have been sensitised through campaigns, seminars and symposium all over the country. yet, much more has to be done to ensure the safety of women and children.
bangladesh and tagore
may 8 was the 148th birth anniversary of rabindranath tagore. throughout the country, several cultural functions were held. this shows that tagore has become a truly iconic figure in our national life. he is the symbol of humanity. his popularity is not confined within the boundaries of a country. he served humanity.
water crisis
shortage of fresh water has made people of gopalgonj vulnerable. the modhumoti river which has dried up and important canals like panchuria, bedgram, khatra, boiragi, char sonakur are full of water-hyacinths which threaten the livelihood of people. people of the town are very much dependent on natural water, but still the authorities could not start removing the water-hyacinths from the dead modhumoti and the canals.
proportional representation
this is an opportune moment to consider proportional representation (pr) for our voting system discarding the constituency based first- past-the-post system for parliament seats. voting would be so much easier as it would be only for a party rather than a constituency member for a particular constituency. it would also be easy to allow non-resident bangladeshis to vote from abroad in the embassies.
rise above petty thinking
recently, an interesting report published in the ds caught my attention. it was regarding the chhatra league's installation of a sculpture of bangabandhu by removing a 31-year old sculpture made by a freedom fighter at a hall of du. i also found it disturbing that one of the chhatra league activists has stated that bangabandhu's sculpture deserves to be on that spot because bangabandhu is a great leader, whereas the deposed sculpture of a former female student merely represented the emotion of the artist. regrettably, these people don't understand that every great leader becomes 'distinguished' in people's heart by respecting the simple emotions and sentiments of the people. we the people make great leaders out of ordinary individuals by inspiring their visions and they in turn must give us enlightening directions. bangabandhu couldn't become a great leader without the admiration of the valiant bengalis. as a result, great leaders and their followers should always be generous and self-sacrificing. unlike greedy dictators, great leaders do not install gigantic sculptures of themselves throughout the country. instead, they work for the people without any bias or self-interest. that's what makes them even greater. great leaders respect general people's sentiments and their followers should also strive to uphold the luminous examples set by them. lamentably, many people in our country fail to grasp these simple facts. in our country, when a political party comes to power it doesn't only politicise the entire administration but it also strives to restructure people's sentiments. in bangladesh, the ruling political party is often keen to rename many central institutions. however, it usually does little to make them more efficient. consequently, even though these institutions bear the name of an iconic leader, they fail to honour the greatness of the name. similarly, the ruling party is generally more eager to hang photos of its eminent leaders in government offices than ensuring tangible changes for the general masses. the ruling party even endeavours to conquer our inner world by rewriting textbooks and by distorting the nation's history. these are certainly not the characteristics of a liberal democracy. these are rather the totalitarian traits that characterize our political parties and their activists. our political parties must understand the fact that no one is greater in a democracy than the people themselves. coming back to the sculpture issue, i believe that the cl activists should have been circumspect enough to respect the sentiment of the local residents and the freedom fighter artist of the deposed sculpture. people generally do not like drastic changes, especially if the changes are forcefully imposed upon them. human heart is mysterious and often the simplest feeling can occupy a very special place in its realm. every single emotion has its own space in human heart and it's not wise for political parties to disturb that order.
killer pesticides
the lead news 'killer pesticides' on the pages of your daily on 5 may 09 had an enormous bearing on the readers and needs to be viewed from a different perspective.
sex trade
in most countries, sex trade or exchanging money for sex is legal. prostitution or sexual gratification for money is perhaps the world's oldest known trade. it is illegal in only a few countries in the world. the reason it is legal is the general attitude that prostitution does no harm, has no victims, and is sex among consenting adults. the changing face of the murky trade has now broadened to include street prostitution, residence sex work, brothel sex work, hotel sex work, call-girl, club sex dance, massage parlour, sex tourism, sex pornography and child sex.

rule of law
a recent news report in al-jazeera's website caught my attention. it read “kenyan landowner guilty of shooting” (www.aljazeeran.net/ english). the report was about a wealthy and powerful white man---thomas cholmondeley who has been convicted by a court for shooting dead a black man , whom he suspected to be a poacher, trespassing on his rift valley ranch.
pm's observation
prime minister sheikh hasina told a public meeting which was held on may 1, 2009 at the paltan maidan that the bnp-led government had plundered tk. 2000 crore in the name of generating electricity.
parents
the insecurity of the parents is rising in the urban as well as the rural areas, even though in most cases it perhaps is not identified as an issue to be addressed with seriousness. i am talking about the 'parenting issue' that includes the struggle of the cultural transition and its ill outcome (due to open media, unawareness, national policies etc.); the struggle of the youth getting hooked to addictive substances and behaviour and the struggle of the 'home' unable to produce productive values in the young minds.
so-called schools
nowadays a lot of schools have been established without minimum infrastructures facilities and capable governing body. some parents run after these schools to get their children admitted.
education and development
as education is thought to be the yardstick of development, great importance should be given to this sector. and it should have been given in the past. but it wasn't. as a result, after 38 years of liberation our country is still backward in all aspects. and if it is not done in near future, our country will never reach the zenith of development. besides, it is known to all that the more the nation is educated, the more it prospers. each and every citizen of a country expects a prosperous life. so, if we want to stand upright among the nations of the world as a developed one, there is no alternative to education. but it is a matter of great regret that no specific education policy has been framed so far.
role of bnp
nowadays i laugh a lot when i see the activities of bnp leaders. they organise processions and meetings where they blatantly blame the present al government for their failure to provide adequate water supply, electricity and gas to the people. god! give me a break. aren't these the same group of people who were in power for five years from 2001 to 2006? aren't these the same old politicians who ruled the country without meeting any of the people's demands? view the page international
