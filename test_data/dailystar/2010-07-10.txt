wrapped in a shawl, off on a trek . . .
minar monsur demonstrated unquestionable courage when he first placed this compilation on bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman before the country in 1979. and it was courage because of the fearsome nature of the times. bangladesh was under its earliest spell of military rule. and just how harsh the times were can be gauged from the very fact that it was general ziaur rahman who happened to be presiding over the fortunes of the country as its first military dictator. it was dictatorship unbridled and unadulterated and not just because politics was in suspension. that parliament had returned, with zia's followers in the majority, really did not matter. what did matter were the sure and steady attempts made to airbrush the father of the nation out of bangladesh's history. references to the 1971 war of liberation carefully excised bangabandhu's name as also those of the political leaders instrumental in the formation of the mujibnagar government.
