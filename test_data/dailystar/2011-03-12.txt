a sense of militancy prevailed
the pakistan government attempts hoodwinking the country. as muhammad habibur rahman notes in his diary of events he calls bangladesher tarikh, on this day in 1971 the regime announced the arrest of what it called indians from among the protestors in east pakistan. the motive was not lost on anyone: the regime had hit upon the idea that giving the bangalee nationalist movement the taint of being inspired by a hostile india or, more specifically, by the hindu community that had never accepted the reality of partition in 1947, would be an effective way of discrediting sheikh mujibur rahman and his politics. predictably, the propaganda did not wash with the bangalees, who continued to pour out on to the streets of dhaka and elsewhere in the province to swear fealty to their elected leader.

shafiul is my m-o-m: imrul
shafiul islam and mahmudullah riyad don't go back a long way, they have very few things in common and they would probably have been expected to do things according to the script. but there was no script on the night of march 11, 2011, and this unlikely pair gifted bangladesh a thrilling win at the zohur ahmed chowdhury stadium.

support beyond borders

the irreplaceable intangibles

policy responses for adaptation to climate change
policy options for meeting the challenges of climate change are basically divided into policies for mitigation and adaptation. policy responses for mitigation intend to reduce the greenhouse gases (ghgs) in order to avoid the anthropogenic causes of climate change. on the other hand, adaptation policies are necessary to cope with the adverse impacts, which will occur despite the best efforts to mitigate the causes. the very nature of climate change exacerbates the inequities in terms of contribution to the causes and the sufferings from the consequences. causal liability shifts the burden to the industrialised countries to take entire responsibility for mitigation and adaptation. view the page literature
dictionaries lost to time
as i embark on narrating the tale of a dictionary, a mixed feeling gathers up in me. it is a useful and precious book but little known to most of us. it in an old book that was first given approval by the authorities way back in 1958. the copy that i possess was published in january 1980, which was its twenty-fourth edition. in terms of time, it is undoubtedly on old book and the saying, 'old is gold', is apt testimony to its merits in a most comprehensive way. and this characterisation makes it not only a book but much more than a book. i am, of course, talking about ashu tosh dev's --- or commonly known as at dev's -- students' favourite dictionary which is from english to bengali and then back to english. hardly any dictionary provides us with two categories of meanings from word entries. dictionaries that have done so, say in bangladesh, have definitely followed the precedent although there might not be any acknowledgement thereof.
with steaming cups of coffee . . .
good afternoon to you, friends from kolkata. it is good to be here, in this historic city, and an honour to be at the famous kolkata book fair. from our childhood we have heard so much about this city, so many of our parents grew up in this city, or studied here, we feel very familiar here.
tagore at oxford . . . . . .
whilst i was casting and re-casting the speech i was to make, posturing in the presence of my closet friend in my rooms, two circumstances made my task easier. firstly, we heard that the poet had already been invited by manchester college to come and address a gathering there and that he had consented. so i had only to request him to divide his time between them and us when he came over. secondly, the poet's son and daughter-in-law were visiting oxford and some of us were asked by 'mullickda' to luncheon to meet them. view the page star health
simple urine test can protect kidney and heart as well

glaucoma — the creeping thief of sight
glaucoma is an eye disease that damages the nerve involved in vision (called optic nerve) and progresses from visual disturbance to permanent loss of vision if left untreated. it is called the silent thief of sight and the person with glaucoma is usually unaware of it until serious loss of vision has occurred. it is often, but not always, associated with increased pressure of the fluid in the eye (aqueous humour). however, it is completely treatable if detected early.
daily diet: out of sight, out of mind
accessibility to food is a problem for many. common wisdom dictates that food on the table is meant to be eaten, hungry or not. keeping it out of sight keeps you from eating more. the same is true of cupboards and refrigerators. tempting treats should not be stored in the front where is jumps out at you every time you open a door, begging to be eaten. try keeping healthier snacks in the front of cabinets, and fresh fruit, cut up veggies, or string cheese at the front of the refrigerator. adding a fruit bowl to the counter is perfect, perfuming your kitchen with the smells of peaches, bananas, plums.

bed wetting not unusual for children
sometimes, children might have certain problems that may create embarrassing situation to the parents. they do not like to share the problem with relatives and friends even. few days back, a mother came to me with a boy of eight years old having apparently no problem. her mother told me that her child wet bed every night. she was tired of cleaning beds and linens every day. she sought help from doctor before and showed me the prescription along with laboratory investigation reports. all of them were normal. this type of story is not very uncommon. we diagnose the problem as enuresis.

making the real seem unreal
while reading syed manzoorul islam's short stories, the first thing that strikes one is the role played by the self-conscious narrator, who is sometimes a part of the story, makes sarcastic remarks about other characters, and remains somewhat unaffected by the major changes and shifts in the plot. more interestingly, islam's narrator assumes both first and third person points of view. at times his narrator, one is apt to notice, is highly critical of assuming any knowledge of a character's unspoken thoughts as in most of the stories in the book kanch bhanga rater galpo. but then in many of his impeccable stories in prem o prarthonar galpo and alo o andhakar dekhar galpo, he adopts a third person narrator and intrudes into the characters' psyche and yet retains the role otherwise played by a self-conscious narrator. however, in his latest volume titled shukhdukher galpo published at this year's ekushey book fair, readers will find him at the height of his post-modern experimentation with his craftsmanship in both narratorial modes reaching an apotheosis.

this year a very young novelist has come forth with a novel at the ekushey book fair. the title of the book is bochhorta chhilo jsc-r, which could be translated into english as 'the year was of jsc'. the young author is brotee das datta, who is only fourteen years old, a class nine student of viqarunnisa noon school.
of glory and flattery
it is the ego we are talking about here. you might as well make a correction and say that the ego is what we have always been talking about, indeed have been nurturing throughout the course of human civilisation. and proof of that is what comes through in this gripping little book wherein you once more have cause to meet the famous and the illustrious, but this time with a difference though.
