bridging universes
a 'baby universe' is connected to its 'parent universe' by a bridge-known as einstein-rosen bridge. it is a short-cut path in spacetime which is called wormhole. the physics of this wormhole is presented here.
the farthest galaxy around
our universe is decorated with the most ancient celestial marvels. one predates the other. recently, european astronomers, with the aid of european southern observatory's (eso) very large telescope (vlt), have discovered something that is the remotest and as such the most ancient of cosmic wonders. this distinguished and most senior citizen of our universe is called udfy-38135539, which is located in the constellation of fornax. back in 2009, this galaxy's image was first captured in the hubble ultra deep field (udf) by the hubble telescope's wide field camera 3. and since then the careful analysis of the very faint glow of this galaxy revealed that this galaxy, which contains roughly a billion stars, was formed within the 600 million years of the very big bang that started the journey of this very cosmos about 13.7 billion years ago. and astonishingly, it has taken 13.1 billion years for lights from that galaxy to reach earth! according to dr. matt lehnert of observatoire de paris who is the lead author of the paper, “using the eso very large telescope we have confirmed that a galaxy spotted earlier using hubble is the most remote object identified so far in the universe”. it is important to note that astronomers determine the cosmic distances by measuring the redshift which is an estimate of how much an object's emitted light has been stretched in wavelength during it course of journey across our expanding universe. to put it simply, redshift allows astronomers to calculate any celestial object's age. and it was found that udfy-38135539 (udfy from now on, for the sake of easy reading) has a redshift of 8.55. this means that the redshift of udfy tops the previous record holder of the oldest object in the universe. and that was a short-lived gamma-ray burst and called grb 090423, which had a redshift of about 8.2 and was, formed about 630 millions after the big bang.

warm spell spurred it all
some like it hot, including the plants living in south america's tropical rain forests 56 million years ago. as global average temperatures spiked 5 degrees celsius over a period of 10,000 years a geologic blink of an eye plant diversity in northern south america also soared, researchers report in the nov. 12 science.
moon's bulge
a bulge of elevated topography on the far side of the moon -- known as the lunar far side highlands -- has defied explanation for decades. but a new study led by researchers at the university of california, santa cruz, shows that the highlands may be the result of tidal forces acting early in the moon's history when its solid outer crust floated on an ocean of liquid rock.
how cats drink
cats are better physicists than dogs, according to a new study at least when it comes to drinking.
what's in the camel's hump?
camels do not store water in their humps, as it is commonly believed. the humps are actually reservoirs of fatty tissue. concentrating body fat in their humps minimizes heat-trapping insulation throughout the rest of their body, which may be an adaptation to living in hot climates. when this tissue is metabolized, it acts as a source of energy and yields more than 1g of water for each 1g of fat converted through reaction with oxygen from air.
