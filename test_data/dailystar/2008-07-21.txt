share market investors
we find dse website very busy during. most of the companies have converted their share transaction system through boi/electronic or computerized account. it makes life easier for the shareholders. you can see the market status through internet or tv channel and you can decide whatever shares you want to buy or sell. this reduces lot of paperwork. this is one of the factors to eventually attract general people to this business. there are some common terms used for this case. ipo, primary share, stock, secondary share, bond, dividend, lot, face value, bonus share, eps, spot sale, portfolio, a, b, z, n, g category, etc. presently, students, teachers, service holders, businessmen, retired personnel all are investing some of their money to learn and see the return.
priority areas
we achieved our freedom sacrificing much in terms of lives. the first govt. of bangladesh was supposed to rebuild the nation with a clear philosophy and motto. but unfortunately we lost the chance at the very beginning.
government subsidy
it is baffling to castigate donor agencies for closure of our jute, sugar and steel mills of the country. the adviser finance had to swear a few months ago in a public seminar of his receiving no such advice from donor agencies. the distinguished academicians (especially russian educated) continued their anger on those agencies without looking into ground realities in the industrial arena owned by the government. mismanagement, corruption, nepotism went unchecked by the successive governments. all the officials engaged in those producing units and their controlling head offices had no accountability. industrial management experts having both academic qualifications and practical experience had no place rather only politically and bureaucratically favoured people got the upper hand which led to closure of mills culminating in heavy losses.
war criminals at work
kicking a freedom fighter ( by the war criminals ) is the reality of our present state of affairs. the sector commanders routinely protested the dastardly act. the politicians of pro-liberation gharana also lamented the incident. students of dhaka university paraded the streets of their campus. but our government, caretaker for two years, virtually ignored the matter.
'no vote'
the freedom of choice is a beauty of democracy. this freedom reflects two alternatives. firstly, given a desirable option against an undesirable one, it is the authority to choose the former and reject the latter. secondly, if undesirable options are forced upon, it is then the capacity to react.
ssc results
we are very happy that our young learners have achieved good results. this year more than 52 thousand students have secured gpa-5, the highest grade point. the achievers, of course, deserve congratulations. i have, still, some questions. first, we should consider that only three or four years ago, a few students got such grading. but within three or four years there is a big change. it is said that in the grading system, teachers are liberal in examining answer scripts.
high level cheating
cheating in public services by highly placed professionals is difficult to eradicate, as these officials control the field level staffs who monitor and implement the rules and regulations.
road shows
the government has much enthusiasm for the road show. we are given the impression that road shows can contain corruption. when many people cannot manage their two meals, spending so much money on such a programme is simply useless. i do not find any difference between the road march that the political parties used to arrange before one-eleven and the so called road shows being organised these days.
israel and the us
israel, a rogue state, has grown very powerful. it is a bully and threat to the entire middle east.
universities and power supply
nowadays the private universities are not getting enough electricity during their stipulated time of research.
'rebranding bangladesh
thank you, mr. mamun rashid, for a wonderful article on rebranding bangladesh. i am an nrb and a regular reader of your newspaper. i have never seen such a positive article from a bangladeshi newspaper. being an nrb we all try in our own way to be the best ambassadors of our country, and honestly we the nrbs are also a valuable product of our country. but as you said, in the western world, the name bangladesh is always attached with poverty, natural disaster and poor government. but if you look at each and every bad thing that happens to bangladesh, its people tried to overcome all the obstacles and shine.
politicians
i was watching a famous film called man of the year, starring robin williams. it is a commentary on american politics.
life in dhaka
i am a university student studying history at drexel university in the us. i am currently in dhaka for the summer visiting relatives. i have been reading the daily star and feel it is both a comprehensive newspaper and a responsible one, admirably living up to its "without fear or favour" motto.
monitor the market
although it is said that the price of edible oil i.e. soyabean oil (per kg.) should be tk 112 (source: the daily star & the daily prothom alo-- 10th july 2008), it is seen that in many markets soyabean oil is sold at a much higher price.
tigers subdued
the asia cup cricket started nicely for bangladesh, though the opposition was u.a.e. the poor batting display however continued and as predicted by many, bangladesh would get only one win (against u.a.e) and that was it. in my previous letter (23.06.08) i predicted that bangladesh would have 10% success in the near future. but looking at the just concluded asia cup, i just have a feeling that i have probably predicted a bit too much.
mockery of humanity!
i was watching a news documentary on cnn the other day. it was a wonderful show of humanity on the part of the american authorities. they were taking an extreme care of a burnt out iraqi boy the boy, named yasuf, was severely burnt and wounded recently in an attack. doctors were examining his physical and mental conditions, and treating him accordingly. it was a show that makes others think or believe that humanity still exists.
sau's location
this refers to prof. sam's letter (ds, dt.14/07/2008) on the above subject which he has written in reply to my previous letter on the same issue (ref: ds, dt.11/07/2008).
don't overlook…
i am writing to you to enquire about the state of coverage regarding rab and the associated activities being carried out by them in bangladesh. specifically, the concern revolves around coverage of such deplorable activities by the government agencies and under-reporting or no reporting of context and content by large circulating newspapers in bangladesh.
