ensuring real estate accountability
the passage of the real estate-related bill by the jatiyo sangsad gives us some hope that the concerns of late expressed about the sector will now be dealt with. it has been a fact over the past many years that the unbridled and unaccountable manner in which real estate developers have gone about building and selling property has left some very critical questions to be answered. among these have been complaints that in many instances developers have not maintained the terms of the contracts they made with those authorising them to develop their property. at the other end, buyers of flats in a number of apartment complexes have regularly alleged that the amenities promised them by developers have been slow in coming or have not been there at all. apart from all this, a section of developers has been seen to violate the plans, approved by the authorities, on the basis of which they were supposed to have developed their housing projects.

railways
this refers to an article published in a local english daily on 14th september about the sorry state of bangladesh railways. elsewhere in the world, railways are being re-vitalised and developed as a carefree, cheaper and relaxed means of long distance transportation, independent of weather conditions. it is getting popular day by day. however, it seems that it is not so in bangladesh, where it is being grossly neglected. in most countries, new routes are being introduced, trains are speeding up, tracks are being upgraded and frequency of service is being increased.
food sovereignty
whether consciously or unconsciously, there is a concept has been evolved in the western world named “food sovereignty” which is far safer than security. sovereignty means that the food is produced within the border of the state. it is limited to the basic staple, in our case rice, and not all of foods. if we look to the west, we see the long lasting conflict between european union (eu) and usa regarding subsidy to the farmers in order to ensure the food sovereignty as well as food security (availability and affordability) for their own people. it was also proven that, there is a relation between ecology & anthropology i.e. the staple food like rice produced in the particular ecology in more appropriate than produced in other ecology (country) for the people (anthropology) as natural law.

the mosque controversy
the building of an islamic trade centre and a mosque near the world trade centre is getting heated up every day in the united states. they are citing reasons that it will severely hurt the sentiments of the people and relatives of those who lost their near and dear ones when the 'islamic extremists' blew out the buildings known as twin towers in a most shocking way. they say that the mosque will be so close to the spot where the islamic extremists brought down the world trade centres in 2001. it would refresh their memory from time to time. the matter became so emotive that a pastor of a small church in florida named terry jones threatened to burn the holy quran if the muslims did not back out from their plans. the threat caused a major uproar in the states and president obama had to intervene and request the pastor to refrain from doing so. the plan for building such establishment and the mosque is being initiated by one imam called faisal abudul rauf. it is important to mention that according to the imam the proposed islamic trade centre and the mosque will be two blocks away from the actual trade centre. the imam also said that nearby there exists a betting parlour. i don't find the logic of the imam to stand tough on his stance and go ahead with building such a sacred place over there!
tri-nation highway
with myanmar's cutting ice with bangladesh by nodding to a proposal for construction of a tri-nation highway connecting chittagong and the chinese city of kunming through myanmar, former prime minister khaleda zia's dream to build the highway during her visit to myanmar in 2003 as part of a 'look east policy' comes true which will go a long way in balancing our lopsided deal with india and ushering in consensus politics in our country.
mine victims of chile
we learnt little about the 33 gold mine workers who have been trapped inside the mine some 3000 feet below the earth surface. they have been captive of the manmade or natural disaster since august 5, 2010. for the last one and a half month they have been cut off from the world, from their sweet home, from their nearest and dearest ones and have been enduring the fury of nature under the earth. they have been passing their days without food, air, shelter, security and others. the chilean government has been endeavouring, leaving no stone unturned to rescue the mine victims. they have brought a very powerful excavator from australia to dig hole to reach the miners in order to rescue them from the trap one by one. but it will take long four months to excavate the 3000 feet deep hole sufficient to bring out the victims. furthermore, in this process more dangers are still waiting for the victims. when the earth will be dug by the excavator, boulders of different sizes will fall upon the victims. as self-defence they were advised to work on shifting basis to remove the boulders. by this time the mine victims got food, medicine, cigarette and other necessary items through a very narrow hole. electricity has been provided there through that hole which will give them hope. pentagon nasa has been formulating new ideas to implement at the disaster site just to make them lively and happy. in the electronic and print media the victims have been shown in bare bodies and in standing position close to one another. it has been reported that temperature inside 3000 feet deep is very high. how long will they survive like this?
recruitment of teachers
it appeared in the newspapers that some of the lawmakers are not happy with the recently published results of the primary teachers' recruitment exams. what are the reasons for their dissatisfaction? is it because their recommended men were not selected for the posts? the nation would not pay any more for serving the lawmakers' interests.
some rule, some law!
this refers to an article published in your daily of september 16 under the above caption. i wish to congratulate writer shahedul anam khan for an article well written. issues he has dealt with in the article, to say the least, are matters of grave concern for the people and the nation at large. it is indeed sad to see the erosion of the moral and ethical content of two of the most important functionaries of the government and the state, namely the police and the judiciary. people all over the country are shocked and dismayed by the events. we have systematically made the sacred office of the highest authority of the country, namely the office of the president, controversial too. the situation of the police is so bad that it is pointless to even talk about it.
freedom of religion
the world leaders were adding their voices to the global outcry against a florida preacher who planned to burn copies of the holy quran in a bonfire to mark the ninth anniversary of the sept 11 attacks. we all enjoy freedom of religion and that freedom of religion comes from a tolerant spirit. we are unable to understand why innocent people are being made targets of vicious attacks in the name of religion. the latest attempt by an american pastor against humanity is unpardonable. neither the quran nor the bible nor the bhagavad gita created james bonds and gave them the licence to kill or hurt. this is our simple religion. there is no need for temples, no need for complicated philosophy.
future of pakistan
in a hard hitting article, "break up pakistan," in toronto's financial post on september 11, lawrence solomon, executive director of urban renaissance institute in canada, calls for breaking up pakistan into various states to stop pakistanis from slaughtering each other. he writes: "the end of pakistan -- its dismemberment into constituent parts -- could be all for good. pakistan -- a creation of colonial britain that's barely a half-century old -- is less a country than an acronym whose passing would soon be forgotten. there is no pakistani nation. ... pakistan is a dysfunctional assortment of disparate, often warring peoples, ethnicities, and cultures whose sum is much less than the potential of its parts, despite much vaunted attempts at nation building."
