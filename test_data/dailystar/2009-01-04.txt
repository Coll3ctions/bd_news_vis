hoping for the best!
it is in fact a great thing that the long awaited 9th national election has taken place smoothly and without any major hazards. now, it's time for the new government to take over soon and work towards betterment and success. congratulations to the successful candidates and all the people of bangladesh. all of us should contribute towards making a better bangladesh. it would be highly appreciated if the opposition parties do not engage themselves in finding the government's faults only. they should work together. and, to do this the govt. should also spread their wings to accept the rivals. one word that should be deleted from our minds is 'bias'. i get really surprised to see youths being biased!

our philosophy
if we sit on a chair and think a bit about ourselves, it'll be clear that we're always in a hurry, looking for money, thinking how to get more money etc. an uneducated rickshaw puller starts his days going here and there looking for passengers to earn money. a govt. worker, no matter whether he is a clerk or an officer, works in an office and get their salaries by the end of the month. a highly paid private office worker leads the life of a machine in search of money. so every one of us is living a life where everything is for money! even our students, from a very early age, are preparing themselves to be eligible to earn money. they're studying not to gather knowledge but for earning money in future! is there anything else in our lives except money?
dispensation of justice
the judicial department is the last hope of the people. there is an aphorism that money buys justice. this is not totally false, as any sensible and conscious citizen can understand the difference in application of law in case of an ordinary citizen and a so-called vip. why such discrimination? the 1861 police regulation act formulated by the then british government is still being applied in our context, though the rules are obsolete and contradictory to many human rights issues, but they are not being changed or reformed, as the rules are necessary to protect the interest of our ruling class.
