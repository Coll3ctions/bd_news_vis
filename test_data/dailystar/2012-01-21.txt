striking balance between farming and environment
agriculture is still the mainstay of our economy. it is considered part of our environment, although man-made. but of late it is conflicting with environment more often than not. while urbanization under rising population pressure is encroaching upon existing farm lands, agriculture is encroaching on the already constrained forests to produce more for feeding the growing number of mouths, besides also polluting the environment in its on process. however, we cannot reduce agricultural activities to conserve environment, nor we can destroy environment for the save of agriculture. we have to strike a balance.
climate governance vital for tackling impacts
over the past decades, distinguished scientists and researchers have warned that humanity has perhaps one or two generations to act to avoid global environmental catastrophe. moreover, the report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) has warned that the global warming caused by fossil fuel consumption may keep accelerating. whatsoever, climate change is but one of a host of interrelated environmental crises that threaten humanity. the people of the planet have seen the veils fall from the eyes of many scientists and researchers and they become advocates for a fundamental change -- globally. the frequent proud statements on economic growth by chancellors of the exchequer instill in many scientists and researchers an immediate sense of danger, for that may not be achieved without further worsening the global warming. already climate change is the most severe problem the globe including bangladesh is facing today, more serious than the threat of wartime. view the page literature

iran standoff, war of words and the armageddon
for the last couple of years, people have been tired of reading and watching a few phrases in the reports of news-media when it comes to the middle eastern (me) affairs. iran is trying to build nuclear weapon and iran is seeking peaceful uses of nuclear technologies: these are the two contradicting propositions that the news-medias have been feeding their readers/spectators. the first statement is being pushed forward by the us and its western allies, and the latter is the refusal from iran to defend the allegation. regardless of the intention of either party's statement, after iraq, afghanistan and libya war, the world is apparently approaching towards another imminent military confrontation.
marine fisheries management
in contemporary ocean governance, management of marine fisheries, the most valuable among all oceanic living resources, has been given due priority in view of the fact that marine fisheries account for nearly 85% of the global fish catch. in addition, marine fisheries play an important role in the global provision of food, supply of least 15% of animal protein consumed by humans and indirectly supporting food production by aquaculture and livestock industries. however, the dilemma that the marine fisheries management has been facing so long is the issue of exploitation versus conservation. needless to mention, principles and extensive regulatory arrangements for the management of marine fisheries on the ideals of preservation, conservation and sustainable exploitation have been clearly detailed out in part v (eez) of the unclos 1982. alongside the normative principles of unclos, various international initiatives (un code of conduct for responsible fishes fao, convention on biological diversity, millennium ecosystem assessment etc.) have been taken to promote optimal utilisation of marine fishes, save the marine fish stocks from deleterious ecological and socio-economic consequences etc. unfortunately, the extent to which the maritime nations are abiding by such restrictive principles of fisheries management remains unknown. while principles have been laid down, strong differences of opinions as to their meaning and implementation continue to persist.
pakistan's 'memogate': an orchestration?
pakistan has become a country of endless climaxes because it seems that the twists and turns will never end. since the abottabad incident, political inconsistency in pakistan has become a consistent phenomenon. sometimes it seems that pakistan is still haunted by the spectre of osama bin laden. however, it does not mean that before abottabad incident there had been a persistent peaceful political ambiance in pakistan. the recent political crisis in pakistan is evolving centering 'memogate' scandal. 'memogate' is a secret memorandum which was allegedly delivered to admiral michael mullen, then the chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff committee, requesting the us intervention in the event of a military coup against pakistan's elected government. the memo promised that pakistan would allow the us input on a revamp of the country's national security set-up, and that it would eliminate sections of the country's powerful inter services intelligence agency, which allegedly is responsible for the isi's links with the taliban. after knowing this secret activity the army got infuriated that finally resulted in involving the supreme court which served a notice over inaction in graft case of president asif ali zardari. view the page star books review
memories of a literary landscape
literary seductions have always worked wonders. you think of virginia and leonard woolf and the impact they had on the bloomsbury group and by extension on modern english literature. there is then the quiet passion, never publicly acknowledged, which forged a proximity between isaiah berlin and anna akhmatova, a relationship that was as mysterious as it was deep, in its many dimensions. in times closer to ours, harold pinter and antonia fraser are rather impressive models of what literary relationships ought to be. and do not forget the riotous links, of a publicly carnal nature, which kept henry miller and anais nin bound to each other all their adult lives. the brownings, yes! who can forget them?

the bengali brigadier in pakistan's army
the war of 1971 remains a point of reference for bengalis, especially those with first hand experience of the conflict as it built up and then moved towards a denouement. with men like khalilur rahman, the war of liberation was at once a distant affair, fundamentally because they were away in west pakistan when the pakistan army launched its genocide in occupied bangladesh in march. and yet there was a closeness, in spirit and temperament at least, where comprehending the issues involved was concerned. rahman was a senior bengali officer, a brigadier, in the pakistan army and stationed in west pakistan at the time. it certainly was not the best of times or the best of places for any bengali to be in. like rahman, there were hundreds of other bengali officers and sepoys stuck in a place from where all the salvoes were being fired at their compatriots in occupied bangladesh. and then there were the thousands of civilian officials, employees and their families stranded in what was definitely hostile territory for bengalis. briefly, west pakistan after march 1971 was a place where bengalis were treated with open disdain and, almost always, as traitors to the country jinnah had built in 1947.
