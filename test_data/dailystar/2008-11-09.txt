tt colleges in a shambles
teachers training (tt) colleges are held in high esteem for the role they play in imparting training to teachers to master the art and science of teaching and managing school affairs, too. when bright graduates receive skill and knowledge development training at the tt colleges they become better teachers and better managers. but, we feel dispirited when news of several tt colleges falling victim to human greed and corruption reach us. we cannot but express our deep concern at the reports that many of such institutes are actually engaged in "selling certificates" instead of providing quality training.
passing on the torch
on november 4, barack obama created history. he was elected the 44th president of the united states, the first from the minority community in us history. his election reflected a generational divide, passing of an old order, and flexibility of the us society to embrace what was once thought impossible, a signal that african-americans, asians, latinos, native americans, and, most importantly, the youth, together can change martin luther king's dream into a reality.

save the sundarbans
the country and people of all walks of life are busy grappling with the high prices of essentials, traffic congestion and power failure in dhaka and all over bangladesh. since dhaka is the capital city the topics related to dhaka get highlighted in all the print and electronic media.
snapshots of events
the last 15 days have been immensely significant for bangladesh's political future. why am i making this gross comment? let me bring our attention to some recent events and bangladesh related activities around the world. event one: the election commission announced that they would not be able to announce election schedule (tafsil) within the previously stipulated date. however, they claimed in a low voice that election would be held on 18 december. event two: sheikh hasina meets richard boucher in his office. event three: un secretary-general ban ki-moon arrives in dhaka. the un-sg meets the chief of staff of bangladesh army. after the meeting the chief announces firmly that the election is going to be held on 18 december without any doubt. event four: the ec announces the polls fixture. future direction: the ctg assures the un chief of credible polls.
fading glory of du
dhaka university---it could be said (and i suppose most of you will agree) is the soul of the country. why? because du is partly the reason behind our independence. if the students of this university had not raised their voices against the pakistanis, then probably we would not have been independent (at least i would not have been sitting here writing this letter). in 1952, it was the students of this very university who made bengali the state language of this country. today we can speak in bengali freely at school or at home because of those martyrs. and it is said that this fight for language finally led the way to our independence.
tourism sector
the tourism sector in bangladesh has great potential. in bangladesh we have many natural beauty spots like the sundarbans, the largest mangrove forests in the world, and cox's bazar which is the longest sea beach. many domestic tourists visit these places but the number of foreign tourists has declined significantly.
retirement benefits
considering the price hike, the bangladesh government was kind enough to declare 20% d.a. from 1 july 2008, even for those who are enjoying lpr. pension/gratuity benefits are calculated excluding this d.a. it is a known practice that d.a. is converted into basic pay only when the new pay scale is executed. in fact, those on lpr will be deprived of pension/ gratuity benefits out of d.a. as soon as they go on pension.
overseas studies
there are some limitations in remitting foreign currency for the purpose of studying professional courses like acca. as a result, the students who want to pursue the course at home face serious problems. for example, some foreign banks are able to draw a draft only for the initial registration for the acca but cannot remit for other exam-related payments, because there is no permission from the central bank. if this was allowed the students would not have faced such a situation,
careless walk on railway track
thanks for your graphical picture on the subject (29 oct.). it shows a hearing impaired (as reported) woman walking totally unaware on a railway track, with a passenger train approaching hardly fifty meters behind her, on the same track! the picture possibly confirms her hearing impairment, as she is totally unaware of the life threatening danger right behind her.
bangladesh and asian highway
recently many people are writing about the failure of the present bangladesh government as well as previous regimes to sign as a member of the asian highway network. bangladesh did not ink the papers because of unfounded fear of allowing transit facilities to india. bangladesh is insisting on diverting the road network through myanmar, ultimately connecting with china. the recent lobbying of bangladesh with the myanmar government is yet to produce any positive results for our country. legally, bangladesh cannot lobby for changes in routes unless it becomes a member. our position has been demoted to the status of observer from member.
enough is enough!
i am talking about our national cricket team captain. bangladesh was fighting hard to save the match in mirpur. the rain was a blessing and respite for us and for our failed captain. one need not mention anything about the performance of the captain as a batsman and team leader.
child politics!
some days ago a news report drew my attention. it was about a 15-year old boy who died in a clash between al and bnp supporters, following a kabadi match in a village. the boy was quoted as an al worker. how can a 15-year old become a political worker? he was not even mature enough to enter into student politics! but we see many teenagers being drawn into politics. during hartals, strikes or processions they are used as pickets.
baul sculptures
it is very unfortunate that the anti-liberation forces are trying to destroy our cultural heritage.
mashrafee, our choice
the way mashrafee and shakib put their heads down and saved bangladesh from the ignominy of following on in the two-day test at mirpur against new zealand is really commendable. both of them also showed great maturity in the chittagong test.
interesting discovery
it was earlier believed that staples like rice, wheat, barley, and legumes were the first domesticated crops. but archaeobotanists at harvard university and bar-ilan university have recently revealed a startling fact published in the science journal that fruit trees are the oldest known domesticated crops. according to their findings, the dawn of agriculture may have come with the domestication of fig trees in the near east some 11,400 years ago!
nobel laureates and election
it is learnt from an email that 76 nobel laureates from science in america were in election campaign for obama. this was an impressive message. people from every discipline should express their own opinions regarding selection of the leadership. it helps them to cross the barrier between the decision/policy makers and the professionals like scientists. just because of lack of understanding, the country suffers, particularly the scientists. nowadays, this problem comes up in almost all scientific events and lots of discussions are held on a regular basis.
baul statues
i commend syed bayazid for his rational, unbiased views about the baul statues issue published in a letter on 31 october. ever since the statues were knocked down for whatever reasons, i have been reading comments, opinions of contributors, readers as well as reports of continuous protests by the cultural activists almost on a daily basis. the reason i appreciate mr. bayazid's views is that unlike most of those contributors, readers, protestors who have no hesitation whatsoever to term these 'mullahs' bigots, he has presented an acceptable, accurate account of the issue consistent with our democratic values.
dhaka zoo
eight newly procured animals have died in dhaka zoo. the ministry of fisheries & livestock allotted tk 5.5 crore for the purchase of the new inmates. a total of 87 animals were added. of the total, 27 rare species were bought from south africa. death of these eight animals caused the government a loss of tk 60 lakh so far.
foreign intervention
i have been observing with keen interest the political developments in bangladesh over the last 30 years. i was there on jan 11, 2006 and stayed a whole year. i was extremely disturbed by the blatant interference of the british, americans, european union countries in our domestic affairs.
