combating corruption
corruption in bangladesh has assumed such large proportions and variegated forms that large numbers of the public have come to believe that it is impossible to get rid of this malaise. in such an atmosphere of pervasive cynicism, one of the things that the guide repeatedly emphasizes - and quite correctly - is that the scourge can be managed or controlled. other countries have been notoriously corrupt in the past but have succeeded in tackling the problem through a mixture of administrative and electoral reform. but in a country which buckles under the gigantic burden of corruption and struggles to find a way to overcome its oppressive weight, any step towards giving the still-nascent anti-corruption movement a fillip deserves to be warmly commended. the media reports and editorials acknowledge the need for a variety of strategies to fight corruption, ranging from general measures such as the simplification of rules and procedures and the application of information technology to specific steps such as trapping corrupt public servants. while agencies such as the acc can play a vital role, any comprehensive strategy to combat corruption would have to involve other bodies such as ngos and the print and electronic media.
prices of rice
while i was browsing some bangla dailies on aug 2, i found a headline reading "khaleda demands tk.10/- per kg rice during the month of ramadan for the people. this call from a popular and a compassionate leader like her has got wide media coverage. i believe people of bangladesh must have been very happy to see her compassion for them. i also thank her for her sympathy to the people during the fasting month and also her religious feelings. my thanks to her are pre-judged and may not hold good if her call is not found genuine and has not been done out of real feelings for the people.

trial of war criminals
the ruling party has started the trial of war criminals. we appreciate this very much. but, are all war criminals involved with just one particular party? then, why did the awami league work together with the jamaat-e- islami to oust the then ruling party (bnp)?
history of bp
the history of the company we now call bp over the last hundred years has really traced the arc of global transactional capitalism. the anglo-persian oil company, guaranteed itself, or won the right to own, all of iran's oil. so, nobody in iran had any right to drill for oil or extract oil or sell oil.
export ranking
a report on the subject published on july 25th in your pages appears rather confusing, because of the use of the word "followed by" in the sentence which i quote: "bangladesh secured the fourth position in terms of value followed by (!) china, eu-27 countries and turkey, said the report."
philosophy of change!
hats off to mohammad badrul ahsan for presenting the real-life philosophy in a very lucid manner (the daily star: july 30/10). however, to me it's not the slot machine philosophy. as a matter of fact, it's the philosophy of fate. no one knows why a rich man becomes poor all of a sudden despite his hard labour coupled with intelligence and capability; no one also can explain as to why a poor person without even much effort becomes affluent almost overnight. of course, "behind every riches, there is a crime." but no riches are permanent. if the father and the grandfather are rich, there is no surety that their descendants would be as rich or they may even reduced to stark poverty. you may also call this the philosophy of change and in the cosmic perspective, it is said that "the change is always better."

tourism in bangladesh
we have got the largest sea beach in the world. but the number of tourists visiting is very few because of lack of modern facilities, and most importantly, lack of advertisements . the sundarbans is one of the largest mangrove forests in the world which is enriched with 334 different species of trees. this is another hot spot for bangladesh to earn huge amount of money. kuakata is blessed by the almighty, where the sun rise and sun set can be seen from the same place.the saat gombuj masjid is a masterpiece and a brilliant example of old architecture. there are many mosques, temples and old castles which need renovation and preservation. these places should be made attractive for the tourists.

auto bike
a few days ago i read a reader's letter about the “auto bike”, electricity powered tricycle, in ds. it focused on the environment friendly aspect of “auto bike”. indeed, it is neither environment friendly nor energy efficient. on the other hand , it is increasing our electricity problem. i am a little worried about it as its number is increasing very rapidly because of its low price and subsidised price of electricity.
dhaka-aricha road
sudden death of an able and earning member of a family brings not only endless sufferings to the concerned family but it also causes a great economic loss to the nation. moreover, the passengers become reluctant to move through two way roads jeopardising economic activities of the country including tourism. rough statistics show that more than 10,000 people die in accidents in bangladesh every year. most of them are able and earning persons. only the economists can figure out the national loss of the country out of their immature deaths. since long, dhaka aricha road has been marked as a death trap . however, after opening of the bangabandhu bridge the number of incidents on the road has diminished as the pressure of traffic has been reduced . but the recent accident which took the lives of two top bureaucrats (mrs. razia begum, secretary to the government and mr siddiqur rahman, chairman, biscic) jolted the whole nation. we have seen that the number of accidents from gabtoli to savar has come down because of the road divider. many hoped and demanded that the whole road be marked by a divider, but it did not happen. if there had been a divider on the road, we might not have lost our two top bureaucrats ( of course, god is the only saviour).
