respect for nursing profession
announcing a package plan to upgrade the nursing profession, the prime minister expected that the standard of the nursing profession in bangladesh would be upgraded to international standard, enhancing the nurses' social dignity with proportional pay and status and also creating opportunities of promotion and avenues to get training abroad. this is surely a new dimension and commitment in the health care delivery system of bangladesh, where the doctor to nurse ratio is 2:1 and patient to nurse proportion is about 8000:1, a very deplorable situation. there are about 20,000 registered nurses in the country, of which 14,686 are in government service and others are working in private hospitals and clinics or have been deputed abroad. view the page sports

always invincible!
we know that bangladesh experienced foreign rule until we achieved complete freedom. in retrospect we see that bangladesh was under the palas(750-1030), the senas(1030-1202/4) ,and after the senas the foreign muslim rule was established. this rule was divided into two periods: sultanate and mughal period. during these periods bangladesh was a province of delhi, the then capital of the sultans and the mughals.
population control policy
the government is going to draft a policy to introduce 'single child family' at national level by 2015. this is welcome news. it is a belated decision, but better late than never. the population boom in bangladesh is a serious socio-economic issue. if implemented and accepted by all of us, it will no doubt benefit the country to tackle many problems relating to socio-economic development, health issues and global warming etc.
save our rivers
our country is home to a number of rivers. but what is shameful is that our rivers are grabbed by land grabbers and polluted by the industries. buriganga, balu, shitalakkhya and turag are ecologically critical to this country, but they are in hapless state. not only these rivers, other rivers are also in poor condition, like our padma has dried up because of the farakka barrage built by india.
indo-bangladesh relationship
bangladesh has been snubbed by india a number of times since independence. the latest rejection of the bangladesh proposal to hold a jrc meeting to finalise an agreement on the sharing of teesta river waters is another example of how india deals with bangladesh. this agreement is pending since 2005. while india failed to comply with the requirements to finalise the teesta water agreement, bangladesh already finalised three agreements, namely: (1) treaties on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, (2) transfer of prisoners and, (3) bilateral agreement on combating international terrorism.
impact of changing climate
the change of climate is now a major global concern. the worst of all the problems that affect all the flora and fauna of our environment is the climate change. there are many plants and animals that are vulnerable to climate change. as a result of increasing temperature, they are likely to be extinct. about 18,000 years ago, the sea level was more than 100 meters lower than today. over the past century, the level has risen by 10-20cm, probably in response to global warming. the mangrove forests will be affected because of increasing salinity during the winter season and high tides during the monsoon.
no reform
our immediate past caretaker government of mr fakhruddin ahmed took many reform initiatives on different issues, like corruption, but i really felt very sad to think that he had never taken any steps against any transport companies which violate traffic rules and also fail to give comfortable transport service to the public. this is also true that no other government had really cared about public transport to give a standard transport service.
nobel prize for obama
president obama has reiterated the necessity of war at the time of receiving the nobel peace prize! all over the world the warlord is subverting the peace process, especially in palestine, yet he has been awarded the prize for peace. what a joke!
du convocation
the 45th convocation of dhaka university, the biggest in its history, took place on 12 december, 2009 with more than 9,000 graduates and post graduates getting their degrees in a high emotional state of mind. president zillur rahman, chancellor of dhaka university, inaugurated the major convocation programme at the middle of the day, at the university's central sports ground, following playing of the national anthem. the university conferred honorary degrees to three distinguished academics nobel laureate chemist prof yuan t lee, inventor of the sono arsenic filter abul hussam as well as indian historian prof ranajit guha. mr. lee received his honorary degree physically. mr. hussam, an ex- du student and mr. guha could not attend at the ceremony. amongst the students in receipt of certificates, 4,203 were graduates, 1,328 post graduates and 58 mphil holders plus 58 phd holders. the university has assumed this is the largest convocation in terms of number of graduates along with guests. dhaka university was established in 1921. its first convocation was held in 1923.
city of opportunity?
prof. nazrul islam, chairman of the university grants commission, has said that dhaka is the city of opportunity. this opportunity brings misfortune for the city as well as for the city dwellers. in the last two or three decades, the population here has increased four times. at present more than one crore and thirty lakh people live in dhaka city. to meet the needs of this citizens, the city is losing its capacity. water crisis, load shedding, traffic jam are now acute.
destroying forests to make bricks!
your correspondent's report along with the photograph, published in your pages on 9 december, graphically confirms the saying that "power corrupts and absolute powers corrupts absolutely"! the report identifies an al leader of chakoria upazila in cox's bazar and his partner, who have set up a brickfield in prohibited reserve forest area of uchitar beel. it seems that the forest officials and the local district administration are unable, or scared, to take any punitive action against them, since they belong to the party in power, and possibly connected with local goons! this is an outrageous example of misuse of power by the awami league!
good step
the increase of population has turned to be a thought-provoking issue in this present bangladesh and it is reckoned to be a `future explosion'.
false certificates
a very important report was published in a bangla daily on 11 december about false certificates of dhaka university. in the report it was stated that hundreds of people are using such false certificates and working in different government and non-government organisations in the country and abroad.
dirty city
i was watching the bbc news channel the other morning when the copenhagen summit was being reported. it was also reported that dhaka is one of the dirtiest cities in the world. this credit should go to the incompetence and sheer laziness of the dhaka city corporation (dcc). dhaka has gone below standard just like the great minds of the dcc.
student politics
student politics had a golden time in the past, but nowadays student politics has lost its glory.
help the developing nations
united nations secretary-general ban ki moon's warning that nature does not negotiate with us is most relevant. to end the stalemate and move forward in copenhagen, developing countries like india and china should agree on an international verification regime for carbon intensity cuts that they have unilaterally declared.
nuclear power
as a nuclear engineer, i appreciate engr. s.a. mansoor's promotion of pebble bed reactors (pbrs) for heat or power generation (dec. 13). it is one of the six concepts being investigated for generation iv rectors (current reactors operating round the world being of the generation ii and iii type). generation iv reactors are not expected to be available for commercial operation before 2030.
bnp and tarique
how can we support a political party whose chief is tarique rahman or going to be the next chairperson? it indicates that the bnp is not a democratic party. can you cite me a single example of tarique's contribution for our nation or our country? how come the top leaders of the bnp nod their heads and accept him as their party chief? thanks to general mass of bangladesh that they rejected rightly not to choose this party in the last election. people got the lesson, but not the bnp. still on the wrong track!
rickshaw issue
though redundant, this is a long debated issue. the ominous flooding of the city by rickshaws is one glaring example of how both the dcc and the govt can be shamefully indifferent to our rural unemployment problem. yes, that the rural people are not starving to death is not because of the govt's good planning or programmes but because they have learnt to survive.
poor decisions
a few days back, i read a report that the present government was going to change the name of "zia international airport" to hazrat shah jalal (ra) airport. this is not quite unexpected news for me since prime minister sheikh hasina plays the name game when she is in power. the perfect example is "p.g hospital" which was changed to "bangubandhu sheikh mujib hospital". secondly, the name of "zia udyan" and "chandrima udyan" were changed.
