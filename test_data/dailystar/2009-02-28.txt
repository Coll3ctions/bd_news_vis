mass grave horror numbs nation
army and rab rescuers yesterday found a mass grave on the premises of bdr headquarters and recovered bodies of 38 officers including the slain director general of the paramilitary force.
the barbarity is unimaginable, unforgivable
as the bodies were being brought out from the sewer one by one, and as a mass grave was being excavated within the bdr headquarters, the people of bangladesh, perhaps of the world at large, stood aghast at the extent of the barbarity perpetrated on the officers of our border security forces. as we watched on television the heart rending scenes of distraught families desperately trying to get a last glimpse of the mutilated bodies of their loved ones and others anxiously waiting for some news of those missing, the natural question that came to our mind was, for what “crimes” were these officers meted out such inglorious death? for what unprofessional acts were life snuffed out of them at the height of their career? for what possible action of theirs could a section of bdr jawans murder their officers in such an inhuman and un-soldierly manner? the answer escapes reason, words and logic. however, one thing can be said with certainty, if there were some sympathy for the points raised by the rebellious jawans, not an iota of it remained in the public mind after the initial extent of the crime became evident yesterday.

malls without fire safety arrangements
our disregard for human lives is once again demonstrated by the fact that most of the high-rise malls in the city are without adequate measures to prevent occurrence of fire and have even less capacity of fighting it properly once it breaks out. this we suspect is true of malls as well as most high-rise apartment buildings not only in the capital but also in other major cities of the country.
keeping faith in our potential
the last few weeks have seen a series of reports expressing apprehension that the slowdown of global growth may affect our country's export performance. it has also been underlined that we might be unable to achieve the anticipated gdp growth over the next three years. it is being stressed that several challenges will also cast a shadow on the overall performance of the country's economy in the near and medium term. they include rising inflationary pressures, infrastructure constraints, adverse impact of global slowdown on aid flow and workers remittance, comparatively weak financial capacity of manufacturers and relative absence of design and product development capability.

the red building
the guava tree at the back of the building was slightly taller than the veranda. once upon a time there must have been railings on the veranda; now it looked like an extra roof - above the ground floor and just below the real one. as kids we - my sisters and i - sometimes jumped over to the veranda from the tree. it once had a smooth cement floor, but now it was just dusty, rough concrete with cracks here and there. the pigeons did their business all over and the air was heavy with the pungent smell. we played house there and made lentil soup with mud, rice with the insides of cactus flowers, fish balls with the beadlike red seeds from a nearby hedge and served it all on plates of leaves.
kali o kolom falgun 1415 - february 2009
when the latest issue of kali o kolom arrived for my review (an occasion i now look forward to, at least partly due to the fact that my friends have informed me that this reading exercise has had a markedly positive effect on my evening adda) i was mystified to find it unexpectedly voluminous. publisher abul khair's note however cleared up the mystery: kali o kolom has completed five years of its existence. let us at the daily star be among those to congratulate the journal for stepping vigorously into its sixth year, and wish it a long and illustrious life. in this regard mr khair writes that while his literary publication has had its many well-wishers, yet that sentiment has not translated into concrete and material support for the journal. this news was surprising, to say the least, since one had expected the very opposite. however, it is heartening to see that mr khair has pledged, like the present government faced with an array of challenges, to carry on come what may. a hearty amen to that!

a good find
rashida sultana is a short story writer and frequent contributor to the literature pages of bengali dailies and little magazines. she is also an accomplished poet of ordinary life, infusing small moments with a heightened colour and clarity that underlines a quietly dissident feminine voice. rashida has previously published two volumes of short stories, on the themes of loneliness, domestic discord and lovelorn lives of the bengali middle and lower middle class, a social segment whose profiles she draws with a swift sureness. in her latest collection of short stories aimed at the ekushey boi mela, porolaalneel, she displays that same sharp eye and ear for their bedrooms and speech, but her convictions about society's victims, its transients, seem to have become stronger, and more emphatic. for readers whose tastes run along such lines, she is a good find, and even better read. view the page star health
