advisor's comments on media unfortunate
we are surprised at the characterisation of the september 17 incidents in pabna as a media exaggeration by prime ministerial advisor h.t. imam. he has indicted the media for what he calls making an issue of the sobbing which government officers resorted to when, in his view, no such emotional scenes took place. the advisor clearly misses the point, which is that there is much more involved here than the tears of those who came under assault by ruling party activists bent on preventing a recruitment of employees in the dc office that was not to their liking. that the office of the pabna deputy commissioner was attacked, that his officers were assaulted by these elements is the glaring truth. that is what ought to have been the focus of the advisor's attention. instead, he has conveniently tried to zero in on the doings of the media rather than on the interference in administration by ruling party followers.
neglect at dmch under fresh spotlight
the critical remarks of the chairman, national human rights commission(nhrc), following his visit to different wards and units of dhaka medical college hospital(dmch) hardly come as a surprise. for, dmch has had a rather deplorable public image -- for a long time, something that scathing newspaper reports have failed to change. but what hopefully should have a trigger effect on the authorities now to move into corrective action is the emphasis laid by him on public health being a rights issue. view the page sports

anthrax scare
the recent anthrax scare has hit bangladesh pretty hard. sale of red meat has fallen as much as 92 percent, 523 people have already been infected with anthrax(ds: 17.09.10) and fresh infections are being reported almost on a daily basis. these figures have already become frighteningly large but what is most worrying is that sick cattle are still being slaughtered and consumed in rural areas. it seems that these people have absolutely no idea of anthrax contamination in the country. we want to believe the government is trying its utmost to prevent the situation from getting any worse but the facts and figures are not helping at all.
traffic in dhaka
the traffic jams in dhaka are unbelievable. as the country's capital, it is a big mess. there is no sign of the authority's responsibility to the public. there is no proper ratio between the amount of available road and the number of vehicles. the ever increasing number of additional vehicles on the road makes life more miserable for the citizens of overcrowded cities. millions of work hours are at a standstill on the road. how can the people of dhaka get out of this painful situation? there is no simple solution. i think the government should encourage more public transportation and discourage private vehicles. like all other big cities, the morning rush hour goes on from 7am-10am. in these three hours the left lane of all main roads should be reserved for public service buses only. all other buses and private vehicles would use the other lanes. similarly, the same left lane rule can be used for three hours in the afternoon. residents should be encouraged to take public service buses and leave behind their private cars at home. public buses should follow a strict schedule with discipline. during rush hours, every two minutes or five minutes (depends from where) there should be frequent bus service so that passengers can travel comfortably instead of having jam-packed buses. government authorities should treat bus owners and their employees fairly in a public-private partnership.
fruits
bangladesh is a land endowed with various types of bounties of the almighty. different kinds of fruits, fishes, vegetables, and medicinal as well as wood plants are available in this country. the people of bangladesh are vastly acquainted with the consumption of various salubrious and wholesome seasonal fruits. every season brings in the message of numerous tasty and juicy fruits! due to smooth transportation and communication, both the people living in villages as well as cities are now enjoying the taste of these fruits. however, it is a matter of great regret that, becoming the victims of the greed of dishonest businessmen, the fresh seasonal fruits are now losing their original and classic tastes! banana, papaya, mango and many seasonal fruits are now being ripened in artificial and harmful ways. some days ago, a newspaper reported that, papaya was being ripened (?) through heating. green banana can easily be ripened within one or half an hour! we don't actually want these kinds of 'conditioned' fruits! we only want the taste of classic and juicy seasonal fruits. the govt. and the law enforcement agencies should take appropriate initiative in this regard.
death
i tried to remember what happened when i was asleep and was shocked by the fact that i couldn't remember anything. i swore never to die. but whatever we do and with all the money in the world we can't stop death. scientists still haven't found any way to overcome it.
a special programme
i have always dreamt of going abroad and studying in a foreign school. my dream became stronger when i applied for the youth exchange and study program (yes). yes is an innovative high school exchange program funded by the u.s. department of state's bureau of educational and cultural affairs. “this program intends to build bridges of international understanding, especially between americans and people in countries with significant muslim populations” as it is said in their website. there are many organizations working in many countries as the coordinators to select participants for this program.
spurious drugs
spurious or counterfeit drugs are a public menace in our country. they are mostly ineffective and can cause grievous injury or even death. the existence of spurious drugs in bangladesh is well known, although not the precise extent. the present government has decided to bring in legislation to hand out the highest penalty to those who manufacture or sell spurious drugs that cause grievous injury or death. this is in line with the recommendations made by several committees and the media. none of them have opposed capital punishment but the point is that stern penalties are a necessary but insufficient condition for putting an end to the spurious drug industry. the present system has serious shortcomings that need to be overcome before any tangible results can be seen. for instance, the drug control administration directorate found the drug control infrastructure grossly inadequate to tackle the menace. there is a dearth of trained drug inspectors across the country. non-uniformity of enforcement has not helped the cause either. although committees constituted in the past made many recommendations, the core issues have remained unresolved. the top priority must be to strengthen the drug control machinery and give enforcement teeth. the fact that not a single prosecution has resulted in life imprisonment since the drugs and cosmetics act was amended in the past to provide for this enhanced punishment shows that legislation alone does not suffice.
sec's role
thanks to dr. sn mamoon for his post " sec interventions" published in your daily of sunday, september 19,2010. dr. mamoon has rightly said with figures how sec's intervention works. we, the investors, are silly and stupid and are not fit to judge the situations and sec has been empowered by our government to look after our interest. they are doing a thankless job. pity, the silly investors instead of appreciating their 'timely actions" want to put them on the dock.
african economy
africa is the world's second-largest and second most-populous continent, after asia. at about 30.2 million km² (11.7 million sq mi) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of the earth's total surface area and 20.4% of the total land area. with a billion people in 61 territories, it accounts for about 14.72% of the world's human population. africa has plentiful natural resources, but poverty, illiteracy, malnutrition and inadequate water supply and sanitation, as well as poor health, affect a large proportion of the people who reside in the african continent. but now africa has real energy emerging from a generation of young entrepreneurs who are determined to compete on a global scale.
introduce brtc bus
the distance between jurain to motijheel via doyaganj is a little over 4 kilometres but the bus fair is very high-- tk 8. in return what we get is immeasurable sufferings. the bus companies don't care about the sufferings of the passengers at all. half the passengers commute standing. they conduct the bus service with so few buses that in rush hours hundreds of people stand in queue . there were two companies in the route but in the middle of the month of ramadan a company named rangdhanu stopped its service. it just increases the crisis beyond tolerance level. almost all the buses are quite unfit to move within dhaka. most of the seats are broken. in some buses you can't find benches at all.
the leader
an interesting write-up of september 19in the pages of a local english daily reaffirms what we feel best describes the bnp. it does not stand for 'bangladesh nationalist party'; but 'boro natokio party' (in bangla). in line with these words, the "netri" too likes to create "natok"; even for a routine matter, like joining parliament!

with every passing day, the repetition of some words in the newspaper are getting on our nerves: vandalism, demand for withdrawal of cases by the ruling party, question leakage, exemplary punishment, blaming this and that etc. the way the things are, it seems the machine of governance is falling apart. the good governance is characterized by decisions and their strict implementation with the coordinated engagement of the government machinery which has become an endangered species in our country. cannot we save it? the government cannot evade the responsibility for law and order by simply blaming others. the vandalism carried out allegedly by the juba league last friday in pabna that forced postponement of the recruitment exam has caused a great chasm in the administration there. the officials that feel belittled by the highhandedness of the local ruling party cadres are now set for applying for mass transfer if the accused in the vandalism are not brought to book. so, now the government has no scope to take this incident lightly. the earlier it springs to action, the better.
international news
i am a regular reader of the daily star, especially the international news and the erudite write-ups. but it makes me disappointed to see that almost all the time the international pages are filled up with a lot of advertisements. sometimes big pictures of unimportant subjects are posted seemingly to fill those pages only.
tax free car for mps
i felt ashamed when i read news of tax free car for our parliament members. i know from the newspapers that the tax free car project alone will cost one thousand crore taka. it is amazing that they are all (govt. and opposition members) united to pass a law allowing their perks and facilities, though they cannot form unity to pass bill for common welfare of the people. we are known as the most poor country in the world and more than 50% people live below poverty line. in dhaka city alone 2 million people live in basti and live an inhuman life. the people living in basti cannot manage two square meals a day. there are no sanitation facilities, no pure drinking water facilities and medicare facilities. having seen this miserable condition people of other countries are extending their hand in helping this destitute people. our parliament members also do not hesitate to seek help from other countries. our govt. is also seeking help from other countries and innumerable ngos are working for alleviating poverty in this country. we are to pay thousands of crores of taka as interest for the foreign loans and under the circumstances i wonder how our public representatives wish to lead a luxurious life at the cost of public exchequer.
then and now
earlier, the head of the state used to go to the field to see the problems of the people and took measures immediately regarding those matters.
poor show
the article "18th bcs officers got zero in english" published in an english daily on 17th sep'10 is not a new complaint against the psc regarding the irregularity and corruption but it's really a horrible picture of the poor quality of the civil service officers where getting zero in english they can be appointed in the era of global advancement and when our country is progressing towards the "digital bangladesh". is it possible to go ahead with such kind of civil servants who have been appointed through irregularity and corruption! now, time has come to re-think to re-build our civil administration sacking those corrupt/inefficient civil servants as we have a lot of talented/quality candidates to serve the nation. view the page international

those self-effacing freedom fighters
when you go through the story of how these 190 individuals exploited the war of liberation to come by their jobs as sub-registrars, you really should not be surprised. after all, in these nearly four decades since our valiant freedom fighters made it possible for bangladesh to emerge as a free nation, many have been the individuals and groups drawing attention to their dubious credentials as part of the mujibnagar experience when all they did was stay safe in the occupied country with not much of a comprehension of the twilight struggle the nation as a whole was going through.
