sharing of river water
bangladesh is not self sufficient in food grain. about 1.5 million tonnes of food grain is imported annually. over and above, the population is increasing at the rate of- 1.17% annually. so all-out effort is necessary to increase the production for self-sufficiency.
beggars
a picture published in the daily star dated 03-02-10 of street beggars has drawn my attention. it is stated that the tejgaon zone of dhaka metropolitan police launched a weeklong drive against street beggars in a bid to reduce petty crimes and relieve city dwellers of horrific pestering by beggars. on the first day, police picked up over 100 beggars. but as the government shelters cannot accommodate them, they were freed on the outskirts of the capital and the drive ended. is it believable that the government cannot make accommodation for beggars while going for huge expenditures like buying duty free luxury cars for lawmakers?
brickfields
the brickfield brings easy money. but it generally degrades the environment and human health.
earthquake
an earthquake, also known as a tremor, is the consequence of a swift release of energy in the earth's crust that creates seismic waves. earthquakes are recorded with a seismometer, also known as seismograph. the moment magnitude of an earthquake is usually reported, with scale 3 or lower earthquakes being hardly noticeable. scale 7 causes severe damage over huge areas. intensity of trembling is calculated on the customized scale. at the earth's exterior, earthquakes marked themselves by trembling and from time to time displacing the soil. whilst a hefty earthquake epicentre is positioned offshore, the seabed at times suffers ample displacement to cause a tsunami or a fatal disaster. the trembling in earthquakes can also generate landslides and sporadically volcanic commotion. basically, in its most generic sense, the term earthquake is used to illustrate any seismic occurrence whether a natural phenomenon or an incident caused by humans that produces seismic waves. earthquakes are caused generally by rupture of geological faults, but also by volcanic movement, landslides, mine blasts, and nuclear experiments.

going big on biogas!
rahman's news report, highlighting the trust bank's thrust on financing the biogas sector, is good news for energy-starved bangladesh. however, i felt that the report was to an extent incomplete to be really attractive for prospective investors or motivators who can encourage their sources in the village level to go for it. his statement, and i quote was "a beneficiary will buy four cows with the money". it would have been better to state "a beneficiary can set up a biogas plant and also buy four cows with the money". that would have been more to the point. however, no mention was made of the repayment terms and the period of repayment, which are important factors for the borrowers.
uncontrolled bcl

home minister's assertion
at the backdrop of growing unrest and mayhem in the major educational institutions, our home minister says that the incident of dhaka university was a stray one. playing down the incident, she went so far as to say that this kind of incident happens. i think such an insensitive and partisan home minister has no right to stay in office any longer. having banished all other parties from the scene, the bcl now fights among its own factions and our law enforcing agencies are continuing to give the ruling party a wide berth and in most cases acting like party activists.
simply unacceptable

student politics?
ours is the land of historic language movement and we successfully achieved our rights to freely speak in our own mother tongue. ours is a land of struggles as we won our independence at an immense cost. historically, most of the people of this nation are not educated or properly educated. some have just acquired degrees without learning anything about patriotism or the sense of responsibility. in all the cases, students were at the forefront of all struggles. they protested against injustice in any form.
