naked truth and more …
some of our readers take a quizzical view of things we write in our columns. but, despite their occasional whimpers, our columns always reflect the naked truth, and truth is possibly the only thing people do not object to seeing naked. and when it comes to "stripping" those blokes in the full glare of the camera we cannot help but be cruel (only to be kind!). view the page sports

saifur rahman and bnp
i have learnt that the reformist bnp (mannan) requested mr. saifur rahman to take over the party. i was really hoping that the reformists truly believe in reform. the reason we are where we are as a nation is because we have no accountability. under the finance minister's rule, the whole financial administration became intellectually bankrupt.

reforms
“reform, reform and only reform” was once uttered by one of the central leaders of the 14-party alliance. this was one of the most talked about subjects in the recent past. today when i am writing this note, the word 'reform' is still the most talked about topic. but only the meaning of it has changed. what started as a movement to reform a single institution (election commission) is now being designed to touch virtually every institution of the country. the funny thing is that a 'selected government' is now doing the work which should have been done by the elected government long ago regarding 'reform'. after 1971 and 1990, i think it is the third time the government is getting the full support of the people. view the page international
