democracy and poverty alleviation?
most dailies, on 18 october headlined on the front page the report which correlated democracy as the means to ease poverty. the other part was on curtailing and eliminating graft to contain poverty. however, this reader could not correlate the relationship between democracy and poverty alleviation! the correlation seemed to be theoretically weak, and rather elusive!
introduce shuttle trains
the dhaka traffic problem continues to be menacing and is going to be worse with time. here is something that the government may consider as a cheap alternative until an effective solution like metro, monorail, circular train is developed.
good suggestions
here are my comments on professor zeba seraj's article on the recent education policy published in the op-ed page of your daily on saturday, the 17th october. some of the ideas enumerated there are excellent. if our past experience serves as a guide, the implementing machinery falls far short of our expectations. for instance, we know that textbooks published by the text book board are below standard containing unattractive pictures and sometimes disproportionate ones which create wrong impressions among young minds. for instance, a nature's study book prescribed for 5th grade shows a tiny moss larger in size than a large fern plant. i brought this discrepancy to the attention of the chairman text book board but without any effect. he promised to look into the matter but could not do anything because of the environment that prevails in such an organisation. unesco, isesco can help in the printing of quality books with nice illustrations but such a noble move will be resisted tooth and nail by the interested parties who control the textbooks market.

rickshaws, again
my old friend, mr rahat of malibagh has once again vented his spleen against rickshaws in dhaka and against the suggestion of prof rabbani of du for a trial period of a few weeks, to garage one's cars and travel around dhaka in rickshaws. heavens forbid, (according to him) how could any sensible person make such a horrid suggestion in these modern times when one's ego cannot do without one's luxury cars even for the shortest of errands?
a beautiful country
bangladesh changes its appearance every season and having six seasons is a rare thing. these are all gifts from the almighty to bangladesh. although its size is small and the population is huge still these problems can be solved.
mps
you use the word 'lawmaker' for an mp (member of parliament), and most of the bangla print and electronic media use the bangla word 'saangsad' for an mp. the use of the word 'lawmaker' for an mp is not correct because it seems many mps do not know what it means to be a parliamentarian. this is true not only in case of bangladesh but also about many other parliaments across the world.
zero carbon emission house!

foreign tours
the honourable prime minister has recently directed all concerned to limit the tour of bureaucrats to foreign countries which, in my view, is a timely move. but the question arises when we see the bulging list of entourage of our ministers, including the prime minister, while they go abroad. i personally witnessed on several occasions the foreigners being surprised seeing luxurious foreign tours by our political leaders.
leaders' language
we expect our leaders to speak in bangla. problem is many of them cannot speak proper bangla; so they try to mix english to hide their shortcomings. this complicates the situation further as their english is not good either. a few days ago i heard one of them using the word "motibeshito', the self-banglafication of the word "motivation". god help bangla, english and bangladesh!
dst
i am not going into details. through you, i request the al govt to conduct a survey amongst school going children who make most honest remarks without any favour or fear about the government decision to go ahead with dst in this month of october. please also include in the survey the guardians. actually you do not need to conduct a survey. a pro-people government goes by the people's opinion. in this era, everybody knows when the sun rises and sets with the accuracy of seconds but probably not our ministers and bureaucrats. i am not elaborating. have they got their own children to take to school and that too by bus or rickshaw just after fazr prayers?
imitating others
we are a developing nation, bangladesh. we are developing very slowly but inevitably, undoubtedly. in our sluggish journey as we are following and copying developed countries like all backward countries do, sometimes adopt awkward activities which were proved wrong later but couldn't be retrieved because there was no other way left. ah, we are such an imitator, copying straightway what the leaders have done, no matter whether those are appropriate for us or not.
what about the pledges?
in any election the awami league itself is enough to win and it is also enough for its defeat. the al thinks they win alone but when they are defeated, all the progressive people are also defeated. when the caretaker government was in power, al leaders were divided into reformists and non-reformists. some illegal money earners took shelter in the reformist camp to save their name and fame. view the page international
