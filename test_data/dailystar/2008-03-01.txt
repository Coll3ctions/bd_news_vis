tales of a dictator and his victims
bangladesh's history in its first decade of freedom was fundamentally a story of bloodletting. you do not have to go into research to arrive at such a morbid conclusion. but you cannot escape feeling a certain sense of irony as you recapitulate the whole episode of the country's actually claiming, and taking, its place in the global community. if the war of liberation in 1971 saw three million bengalis dying at the hands of the pakistan armed forces, the post-liberation era turned into a long tale of blood and gore as most of the new nation's founding fathers and war heroes bit the dust through bloody coups d'etat and internecine armed conflict. the series of tragic happenings that engulfed bangladesh between august and november 1975, followed by the execution of abu tahir, a soldier for freedom, in july 1976, will remain a blot on the conscience of a nation which yet struggles to find a way out of the woods for itself.
aching realism and provocative meditation
human beings are seekers of truth. the infinite plan is a poignant saga of one man's search for love and his struggles to find the meaning of life. the protagonist of the story is a seeker of truth that can make him free. isabelle allende weaves a vivid and engrossing tapestry of how a mexican family is absorbed into life in america. this is the story of gregory reeves telling the story of his life. the story is a mixture of first person and third person narrative. gregory speaks of his own realisations and life axioms. other characters and plots, vibrant and richly imagined, enter the story line in the third person.

of sensuality and seduction
books about lost love and sacrifice are always available to readers. there are also books about one generation passing on its secrets and lessons to another. there are books about making decisions that can change the track of one's entire life. marisol's the lady, the chef and the courtesan mirrors all these topics, but does so with such warmth and élan that a reader forgives its familiarity and just loses himself in the book.
