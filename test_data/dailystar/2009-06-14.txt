whitening black money
it is not surprising that the budgetary proposal to allow whitening of black money has drawn flak from different quarters. though the finance minister has said, "politics is the highest art of compromise", critics wonder whether this is not a compromise at the altar of political expediency. it is difficult to see how the economic dividends sought to be derived from the proposed move could actually accrue. the past experience with granting similar extraordinary concession leaves us wondering what gain had accrued to the public exchequer previously so as to justify a recourse to it again. we are in the dark about the extent of money thus recovered and invested in the productive sector through such a move in the past.
the errant lawmaker
awami league lawmaker m.a. latif is in the news again, for obviously negative reasons. as newspaper reports would have it, the jatiya sangsad member from chittagong tried to force his way into a meeting of the water transport coordination cell (wtcc) in the port city on friday. when he was prevented from doing so, he is alleged to have verbally abused police officials present and even had the premises put under lock and key, though abortively. when the police positioned themselves inside the building, the lawmaker simply lay down on the floor to register his protest, a posture in which he remained for a few hours until he was moved out of the place.

a budget with a difference
the first budget of the grand-alliance government was presented in the parliament last thursday by finance minister mr. a.m.a. muhith. after remaining "captive" to an unelecected caretaker government for two fiscal years, the budget is back to the beholder (parliament). this is, to me, the first good news to note.
the changed vision
many people call it too ambitious, some consider it too pragmatic, and supporters of the grand alliance are proud of the budget as being consistent with its election manifesto and the change of vision 2021. the public on the other hand, by and large, feel that it is the usual exercise, with many hopes and ideas but difficult to implement with this bureaucracy frightened with fears and trembling with tears. view the page sports

tipaimukh barrage
our motherland has been turning into a desert over the years, due to the river linkage programmes of india that started off with the farakka barrage. we have got some international rivers in our country. most of these rivers crisscrossed millions of acres of land in india before their arrival in bangladesh. both bangladesh and india have equal rights over the waters of these rivers. but, ignoring the rights of bangladesh, india has been constructing barrages on many river systems. in the past, india diverted water from the padma and the tista by constructing dams in their indian parts. the hinterland of the two mighty rivers has turned barren for want of water.
polythene bags
in the past, people used to go to bazaars with big baskets. “thonga”--a bowl shaped paper container in different sizes-- was also being used extensively. but 20-25 years ago polythene bags started entering into shops. they are very light, cheap and comfortable, no doubt. but as it has some elements which cannot be wasted or destroyed, drains, cannels etc were blocked. now there are ten feet polythene layers on the bed of the buriganga and it is one of the main reasons for the death of this important river.
obama's peace initiative
obama's peace initiative taking off from cairo is a most welcome endeavour. i am confident that he will succeed in overcoming bush's bullishness, folly and misguided concept of the "gang of evil" indoctrinated by the jewish-conservative destructive groups that tutored bush all the way. it may be a difficult job to make a 180 degree turnaround; given the conservatives' short sighted war mongering basis that created the misery of iraq and afghanistan, and is now targeted on iran! i am sure everyone will join me in wishing obama god-speed in his praiseworthy effort to usher in world peace, given his heredity.
extortionists at work
as a developing country, we need to create a congenial atmosphere for the growth of trade and commerce. recently, a number of armed gangs of extortionists have started to threaten the industrialists and business personalities. business entrepreneurs are receiving phone calls from those criminals with demands for huge sums of money, even from outside the country. people involved in real estate business have also been targeted by them. the godfathers are always staying behind the curtains. all the business people and industrialists have expressed their anxiety as they cannot carry on their business at the cost of their lives. those criminals must be traced down and stopped.
natural gas
the justified access, use and distribution of a national wealth are a right that every citizen of a country should share & benefit from. although it is very difficult to arrange and practice such things, especially in the developing countries, there is no harm in using some paper and ink in at least letting the people know about the privileges that they are entitled to.
educate people
right after the end of the caretaker government's rule, bangladesh is seeing all dormant evils coming to life! thugs and muggers are active again, killing businessmen and even students.
"nodi bachao, dhaka bachao"
even a few days ago it was not possible to realize that our dying rivers could be saved. but we hope now that the rivers can be reclaimed. so i feel obliged to say that such consciousness among the general people, even the illegal occupants and the government, has come because of the role played by the press.
khaleda zia's statements
i wrote a similar letter on the subject of ds editorial under the headline "politicians and people" which was printed on monday, june 1, 2009. i whole-heartedly appreciate your advice to the leader of the opposition. begum khaleda zia was, in fact, caught unawares and she could not believe and is still unable to digest the 29 dec election results.
rivers and our existence
thanks to my favourite newspaper “the daily star” for launching a war against the polluters and grabbers of the rivers surrounding the dhaka city. my sincere tributes to the editor, pinaki roy and morshed ali khan for taking such a bold step with a firm commitment to winning the war. my sincere thanks also to the channel i authorities, particularly faridur reza sagar and s. siraj and other print and electronic media that have supported our continuous movement to bring it up to the latest form of a war designed by the daily star and channel i.
after-effects of political culture
our glib politicians never talk about the negative cumulative after-effects [the other side of the coin] of our political culture on our 'developing' society; which now lacks morals and morale. we are water buckets with leaking holes! political sanitation standards stink!
tv ads
there has been a revolutionary change in the commercial tv ads in bangladesh. to keep pace with the competition, companies have adopted new marketing and promotional strategies which changed the advertising tactics. but companies do what is good for their exposure, which should not be the sole purpose of advertising. if we talk about business and marketing ethics then companies should promote their message to the consumers in a way that don't breach the consumer rights. but what we are watching in the tvs today, are not appreciable. many well-known companies are broadcasting not only deceptive but also sometimes disturbing and obscene commercial ads. i don't want to mention the names but i think the people concerned will recognize those. for example, there are many ads about some baby foods such as milks and health drinks which promise some ridiculous and impossible benefits that a baby would get if they use that product. these type of deceptive and misleading ads should not be broadcast by the tv channels. so, to protect the consumer rights and protect the consumer from fraudulent tv ads, there should be a censor board which will filter all sort of unexpected ads out. we all know that there is a censor board in our cinema industry which is not very effective. but the censor for tv should be effective because tv is watched by all in a family. there must be some regulations on using children in commercial ads too.
another sore point!
the ties between bangladesh and india have not been so remarkable over the years, except during the 1971 wartime. we have to acknowledge that indians wholeheartedly extended a helping hand then. but over the years, due to india's big brotherly attitude and anti-indian propaganda at home, the bilateral relations have been soured.
rupsha-bagerhat train
the narrow gauge railway train services between khulna and bagerhat via rupsha river were in operation for over 100 years. but the railway services were closed with the removal of railway tracks a decade back. in the past, bus services were available during the dry winter season using the muddy district board road. after liberation, an all weather road was built leading to introduction of minibus services which is the lone communication mode today. it is needless to narrate the difficulties for the travelling public, especially the children, elderly people, ladies, sick etc.
black smoke
some days back roads and highways were seriously polluted with black smoke released by the vehicles. following introduction of gas driven vehicles, this pollution was reduced significantly. but now black smoke has entered into the homes as many residential houses and factories are frequently using diesel generators during load shedding hours. this black smoke produced by the generators is becoming a major threat to public health and environment.
