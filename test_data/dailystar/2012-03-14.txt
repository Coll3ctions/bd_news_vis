plight of job seekers from pvt. varsities
a number of graduates from both public and private universities are being produced every year. their ultimate hope is to secure a reliable job. but it is a predicament for most of the private university graduates that they have to face a bleak and discriminated recruitment circular by the department of human resource management (hrm) of many private companies, banks and academic institutions. whether a candidate is qualified or not can be determined after her/his going through a competitive written test and viva-voce. but it is very illogical and unlawful to deter the private university graduates from appearing in the recruitment tests by mentioning only a few universities eligible in the circular recruitment we are observing in the daily newspapers and websites. such kind of open discriminatory circulars discourage and frustrate the university graduates from achieving academic excellence. to ensure the quality of education is the collaborative duty of the university grants commission (ugc) and the university authorities. it will be an injustice to make most of the private university graduates victims of private university act 1992. so the ugc and the respective university authority concerned should come forward to resist the hrm policy of many companies who are openly discriminating, rejecting and consistently barring the private university graduates from appearing in the recruitment tests.
