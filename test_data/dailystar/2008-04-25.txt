voter registration quality assessed positively
it is a cheery piece of news that a survey sponsored by the uk department for international development (dfid) has found the ongoing voter registration process in bangladesh to be of international standard. the imperfections detected are 'negligible' and can be set right without difficulty. admittedly though, it was a sample survey and not a national one, its coverage was not small either: 9,793 persons took part in it from as disparate places as rajshahi city corporation, raozan pourashava of chittagong and taherpur upazila of sunamganj. the survey gave an idea of the trend and direction of things, which can be extrapolated for the entire operation.
worsening conditions in sri lanka
conditions in sri lanka have in recent days taken a nosedive. with 52 guerrillas and 38 government soldiers dead in northern jaffna, it is easy to understand how swiftly the country may be sliding back to full-scale hostilities between the government and the tamil tigers. the latest incident of violence has been a direct result of colombo's bid to seize territory under the control of the ltte and only underlines the ferocity and desperation with which the two sides are now locked in a battle of wills. but anyone who has some understanding of the long history of the conflict, which began in 1972, will also be aware of the tortuous and eventually fruitless negotiations undertaken to bring about peace in the country.
avoid perceptions becoming a reality
delwar hussain -- leader of a faction of the bnp (pro-khaleda, as commonly designated) -- has asked for the resignation of the cec and the other two commissioners. he feels that the current ec has lost its credibility by sticking to its position regarding the leadership question of the party, having invited saifur group to attend the political dialogue which the ec is holding with the major parties. equally disconcerting is the fact that this faction of the party feels that the caretaker government is "making a blueprint for the upcoming election and working towards achieving the goal of holding the election in line with that blueprint."
a walk of shame
it was a gruesome parade on the political catwalk when a former finance minister, who is the acting chairperson of one of the two factions of his party, was recently dragged in and out of a press conference. his disheveled clothes and incoherent speech suggested that he was gravely ill, and the microphone slipped out of his hand again and again while he couldn't even lift his head to face the audience. the rude reality of life is that what goes around also comes around. at times leaders exploit the party. at times the party exploits them.
let good apples drive out the bad
after the british left the sub-continent more than half a century ago, there were high hopes among hindus and muslims alike since two nations were created: hindu majority india and muslim majority pakistan. all the hopes shattered within weeks of august 14/15 1947, when a few million people left their ancestral homes and property behind because of the fear of an ethno-religious cleansing and took shelter in new lands (indian muslims to pakistan and pakistani hindus to india). view the page sports

st. martin's island
bangladesh environmental lawyers' association (bela) has been working on the legal aspects for preservation of the environment and has also accomplished significant tasks in this field. the recent news in your newspaper (ds 19-04-2008, pg. 2) regarding bela serving legal notices against illegal structures in st. martin's island attracted my attention. the structures in st. martin's island were not constructed overnight. the foundations of some of the structures were laid as early as 1996 even before the island was declared as an ecologically critical area (eca) in 1999. most of the construction took place during 1997 to 2004. thereafter with the growing concern and discussion about the fate of these structures slowed the construction spree. at present the government authorities are not allowing any further concrete construction by the outsiders who have bought land in the island. however, to avoid the present restriction on construction local people in partnerships with outsider businessmen started to make edifices on their own. further, the local people are in favour of building structures as they will be benefited monetarily. in my article on this construction issue in st. martin's island (ds: 05042008), i raised the question whether restriction on construction will help save the island's biodiversity while other factors responsible for habitat degradation, biodiversity loss continue unabated.
food crisis
the government needs to stipulate the maximum retail prices of rice. hopefully, this may afford relief to a populace that has been suffering as a result of high rice prices for a long time.
bangla calendar
i cannot praise enough the splendid article, “our fiscal year should be based on bangla calendar” by syed muazzem ali. i invite all to read it and contemplate. for the not-to-be-easily-convinced, a second or third reading is recommended.
silent famine
a man with a pale face, skeleton like figure in dirty dress has been living for some days in front of a community centre (mirpur -6) beside a drain with no roof, no cot but he is living there as if it were his house. who knows when he had bathed last and for how many days he has been starving (without meal). people cannot stay at the place where he lives. however, he is one of the many homeless people in dhaka city. this clearly shows that dr. akbar ali khan rightly observed that a silent famine is going on in bangladesh. the present government which came to power for only three months and to arrange a free, fair and credible election should acknowledge the situation. but ironically it is not doing so, rather we found the responsible people making fun with the poverty of the hapless people by advising them to eat potato, instead of rice. however, my question to the people who gave the potato theory: did you try potato instead of fast food at your home or in any advisory council meeting? we know the answer must be: no. so don't you think you are being unkind? my request to the people at the helm: acknowledge the famine like situation first and try to solve the problem.
national women's development policy
the government, in all its wisdom, has referred the national women development policy to a committee of ulemas. the following are just some excerpts drawn from the daily star of friday, april 18 which highlight the ulemas' response.
gas-driven generators
there was a news item on april 12, in a local english daily about wasa utilising "gas driven generators" at its water treatment plant, which provides relief from power failure and is cheaper! this is only the confirmation of what is known to the industrial sector and is happening in practically all industrial units in bangladesh. all of these provide prime power from their own generators, mostly gas driven except diesel driven where gas mains are not available!
women's rights
in light of the review committee's report, my question is did they publish a more formal report where they said a little more than "it clashes with the holy quran's teachings" and said "just rights" should be ensured for men and women in light of the holy quran and sunnah"? my question here is simple, did they give elaborate quotations from the holy quran and hadith that support their ideas? islam is not some scientology that the information is all obscured and granted only to a few. we have access to all the info, materially anyway, that the ulemas and the muftis have; so, i think it is only fair(since we are talking about the word so much anyway) that we the people ask for clear and unambiguous quotations from the sources that are guiding their beliefs and that are helping them 'decide' which laws need amendment.
remittance
myself and millions of other remitters send millions of dollars to banks of bangladesh. my humble question is, how has the money been spent? expatriates who are spending sleepless nights in middle eastern countries shouldn't be ignored. has the govt formulated any policy for the nrbs?
madrasahs in india
india is attempting an innovative approach to strengthen its madrasahs. as of this week, the national monitoring committee for minorities' education in india has recommended to the central government's ministry of human resources development to integrate the madrasahs in each state with the syllabus of respective state's government schools. the recommendation, part of a larger initiative to modernise the madrasahs, envisages that a government school, closer to a madrasah, will be given the responsibility of supplying the madrasah with textbooks in english, other languages, science, math. and social sciences. teachers from the government schools will also conduct tests and examinations for the madrasah students. in explaining the rationale for this recommendation, the minorities commission reasoned this measure as a way to enable the madrasah students attain a larger world vision, as was indeed the original philosophy many decades back.
vat
the bangladesh government is continuously losing a huge amount of vat and duty because of inept customs/vat inspectors. not only is the government losing vat/duty but the businessmen are also facing harassment by the inspectors due to the latter's inadequate knowledge of different products.
tackling food crisis
voices from different corners are being heard in favour of reintroducing the rationing system in the country to cope with the food crisis. the government is trying its level best to tackle the situation with the present food policy of open market sale. but unfortunately what we are observing is not working properly.
explosion of gas cylinder
on pahela baishakh when the people were enjoying and celebrating the "nabobarsho", a young but poor balloonwallah (seller) met a tragic death as one of his gas cylinders blasted with a terrible sound. with the cylinder the man was flown into dhanmondi lake. i heard such kind of explosion of a gas cylinder for balloons a few years ago in old dhaka. not only the balloonwallah but also the children who are attracted to buy these balloons can be hit or killed. so a restriction must be imposed on the use of these cylinders.
american ambassador
on behalf of the people of bangladesh, i would like to extend a warm welcome to the new american ambassador his excellency james f moriarty. we hope that he will work for improving the relations between the two countries and have an enjoyable stay here.
bus service
the other day, i was returning to my hall from gulshan. i was on the bus having a 'sitting service'. but the bus was full of people. the conductor took the full fare from all the passengers. the driver stopped the bus several times to take passengers, though his bus was full.
