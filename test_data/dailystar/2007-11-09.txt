earthquake alert
it has been regarded by the experts as the most powerful earthquake to have visited southeastern parts of bangladesh including chittagong in the last ten years. on wednesday we have had the foretaste of what it would be like if seismic wave higher than 6 on the richter scale should hit bangladesh. dhaka, sylhet, chittagong, cox's bazar, feni, noakhali, bandarban, rangamati, khagrachhari are within the vicinity of the vulnerable tectonic plate whose slight movement underneath could send severe tremors across the upper crust areas wreaking havoc on life and property.
golfers or land grabbers?
we are outraged, like everyone else, by the decision of the housing and public works ministry to give away 25 acres of land in suhrawardy udyan to dhaka club for a golf course. why such prime land should be given to a club when shrinking space in the urban areas has become a serious public concern is mind-boggling. environmentalists and other sections of the population are right to demand that the decision be rescinded and that nothing should be done to damage the existing landscape of suhrawardy udyan. over the years the udyan, formerly known as the race course, has lost a good deal of its character through such edifices as the engineers institute and the roads and highways department coming up. in the early 1980s, the establishment of a children's park took away a large chunk of land from the udyan.

the yaba state of mind

clock ticking for monarchy?
serious differences between the government and the radical leftists on the fate of monarchy in nepal appear to have narrowed down significantly following the passage of a proposal by parliament asking the government to initiate legal preparations to declare the country a republic. this has not fully resolved the simmering dispute, but has certainly alleviated the situation that had threatened a complete govt-maoist rupture. view the page sports

marriage
it has already been proved that girls in our country are capable of performing an equal role as their male counterparts, provided the requisite facilities are available. in one are they obtain a higher credit than boys since their presence in society is as exquisite as flowers in the garden. but in an important sphere of life like marriage girls are often not asked to give their opinions. consequently, marriage, the tie of love becomes a mere shock to many girls. in the existing marriage system few girls are allowed to express their opinions. recently, i had a frank conversation with many university as well as college going girls and found the majority of them are not independent of their family in the matter of marriage. a great many of them do not dare to argue with their parents regarding marriage to avoid severe punishments.
flawed maps
recently i went to visit some tourist spots in different districts of dhaka, barisal and khulna division with my wife and children using our own car. to plan our routes we bought recently published maps of five different commercial publishing houses of the country. unfortunately, we found that the road routes shown in these maps are someway different form the reality. we found some excellent highways comparable to british a type roads which were not shown in any of these maps. secondly, we found some roads shown in the maps which are not in existence. third, the maps are not properly scaled. fourth, the maps do not show the existence of ferryboats. there are many other drawbacks. we used roads shown in the maps then when we reached a destination we learnt that we could use shortcuts.

bring in joy
now that the top leaders of the two largest political parties have been thoroughly discredited and are unlikely to be able to participate in the next national election (because of the on-going numerous court cases), the awami league stands a better chance to reorganise and prepare for it. but for that the al must persuade sheikh hasina's son , sajib wajed joy, and entrust him with the task of house cleaning and nominating persons of 'more or less acceptable background' to contest in the election.
hasina's detention
in response to questions in kennedy school of government, boston, our army chief replied that sheikh hasina is being tried under ordinary laws of the land in an open court and also that he would be happy if she is acquitted. is this so? then why after 7/8 years of alleged occurrence of the "crime", some people were taken into custody and why they were released soon after.

go green! get green!
according to some of the world's leading international and development groups, global warming threatens to reverse human advancement and make unattainable all un targets to lessen poverty. in a journal, oxfam, greenpeace, christian aid, friends of the earth, wwf and 15 other groups state that rich governments must immediately address climate change to avoid "obscene levels" of worldwide poverty. "food production, water supplies, public health and people's livelihoods are already being damaged and undermined," the journal says. "there is no either/or approach possible. the world must meet its commitments to achieve poverty reduction and also tackle climate change. the two are inextricably linked."
regulating air and water quality
recently, air and water pollution has drawn the attention of environmentalists in bangladesh. air and water are crucial for the survival of all living organisms on earth and the most vital of natural resources. they are needed for human health, breathing, drinking, agriculture use, wildlife, aquatic life, and ecosystem etc. they are vital components of the environment, interlinked with other components and the quality of the environment. water plays many roles in the biosphere, including being a habitat for millions of species and a part of the hydrological cycle. the environment, economic growth and development of bangladesh are highly influenced by water -- its regional and seasonal availability, and the quality of surface and groundwater.
indigenous people and forest care
indigenous communities use the forest with restraint because it provides for their basic needs -- food, shelter, water, medicine, fuel and clothing. the bambuti people of the congo refer to the forest as mother or father, and hold it sacred: a deity to ask for help and to thank. the yanomami of venezuela and brazil believe that the natural and spiritual worlds are united: the fates of all people and the environment are inexorably linked. so when people destroy the environment, humanity slowly commits suicide.
