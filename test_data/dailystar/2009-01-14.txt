fifty per cent of textbooks yet to be printed!
it is that time of year when students in secondary school should be walking into class with new textbooks in hand. unfortunately, as much as fifty per cent of them simply cannot do that because the number of books printed so far is far short of demand. in other words, it is the same old problem, which comes up on an annual basis, only that it has come about in a much aggravated forms this year. the authorities are now of the opinion that those students in classes vi to x who do not have textbooks will need to wait for anywhere between two and three months before their needs can be fulfilled.

population boom bogey?

drug addiction
the number of addicted people is increasing day by day. i know a boy, who is my neighbour belonging to an educated family, badly addicted by drug. in his early stage he was a good student and had a sound personality also. several times, i tried to pursue him and tried to rescue him from this world, but he did not pay heed to my words.
unguarded remarks
i hope that the newly installed elected al government ministers have realised by now that unguarded and politically provoking remarks in the media might bring more harm than benefit to the individual and the party. the statements of the finance minister and the commerce minister on market management, especially on breaking the syndicates, were not based on facts. they should gather full information first and then give a policy prescription. this has only encouraged the private policy oversight institutions to come up with explicit comments on the syndicate issue. it is also important to note that the same person of this powerful oversight institutions has also provoked the existing syndicate to determine their course of action in the backdrop of the political note of warning and how they are going to respond negatively. we heard the commerce minister on channel i “first minister” programme. he was informative and adopted a more practical approach to handle the syndicate. the most important thing he mentioned was that the syndicates exist and operate harmfully when political support is extended by the party in power. this is the catch issue. i hope both the ministers would keep this in mind as policy guideline. by the way, we are hearing about the syndicates since the bnp government. tell us openly who are they or ask the fbcci to find out who are they, why and how they operate.

people across the world became hopeful and happy when barack obama was elected us president, thinking that they were going to get rid of the ruthless terms of president bush. but obama's silent support to israel's massacre is making people frustrated and they are losing their trust in him. just at the moment us is the most powerful country of the world and their support to anything gains the highest weight. israel is continuing its barbaric attacks upon the innocent gaza people. gaza has become the death-trap for thousands of helpless women and children. in the name of weakening hamas they are carrying out both air strikes and land attacks on the densely populated areas of civilians and killing the innocent.

obama's victory
the people of the whole world found their expectations come true with the election which barack hossain obama won by a big margin. he has acquired a mandate for change. braving all odds he moved forward to create a new history. his election message 'change' touched the hearts of the american people which helped him to conquer the white house putting the racial issue in the coffin. it reminds us of the film "the roots" where we saw the bravery of another great "kuntakinte" who refused to change his name as suggested by his captors one hundred years ago. people around the world are now looking forward to watching the mettle of this young leader in tackling various issuesnational and international.
discriminatory education policy
we always talk about democracy, but how much democracy is there in the educational system? when we see the educational systems of city schools and village schools, we can realise that there are many differences. most of the teachers of village schools, who have no experience, are not good enough. they cannot teach the students properly or appropriately.
free market economy?
for developed and industrialised countries free market economy is a means to affluence and prosperity. their mastery over science and technology and industry have enabled them to produce a plethora of agricultural crops, high standard varieties of goods and commodities, equipment and machineries, arms and ammunition, war-planes, motor vehicles, warships, submarines, atom bombs and what not!.
small cabinet
last tuesday, the new prime minister and ministers took oath. through the oath ceremony, awami league president sheikh hasina was sworn in as the country's new prime minister and 32 surprise picks also were sworn as ministers to run the ministries. the people of bangladesh were surprised after witnessing a small cabinet. it's also surprising to note that al president sheikh hasina has left most of her senior party colleagues out of the new cabinet and brought some young, competent and talented people. it is also to be noted that, from 32 ministers, 24 are new and young who have no idea about the ministries. though they are new and inexperienced, they are honest and competent persons. now, they have to show their ability in future through firm decisions and activities because ability is something different from honesty.
learn from your mistakes
the 9th parliamentary election has worked like a mirror which has reflected the results of the activities of political parties and significance of people's might. results of mistakes committed by the political parties have also been reflected in this election. it seems that it has issued a warning to the political parties“learn from your mistakes and do not repeat them.”
energy efficient boiler
your report on the use of energy efficient boilers, published on 6 january, is a generalised logical statement. to make the industrialists interested to convert their boilers (if possible) more cost benefit advantages should have been spelled out. a simple statement that a 10 ton/hour boiler raising saturated steam at 10bar if replaced by an efficient boiler would cost say tk.10 lakh, and the fuel saving per annum would be tk 1 lakh indicates a pay back period of ten years.
bnp leader's assertion
emergence of sq chowdhury as seen on local tv coverage also heard on bbc (bangla service) for two days with his usual arrogance apparently confirms his position as the new leader in the helm of bnp. he claims his party still with three crore voters behind should be a force to reckon with; which certainly is a matter of fact.
