aung san suu kyi emerges into freedom
the release of aung san suu kyi from her long confinement is truly a triumph for people who have held faith in democracy not only in myanmar but also across the world. it is also a tribute to the resilience and determination with which ms. suu kyi has upheld her politics and her values since returning to her country in 1988. that she and her party, the national league for democracy (nld) were not allowed to take power after their massive victory at the elections held in 1990 remains a dark chapter in myanmar's history. had ms. suu kyi been permitted to form the government, the face of her country would be a whole lot different, and positively too, by now and myanmar would be playing its due role in the international community. unfortunately, the people of myanmar, despite the inspirational leadership provided by aung san suu kyi even in her imprisonment, are yet to see pluralistic politics reshape the image of their country. view the page sports

those were the days
eid is a fun day for children. as eid-ul-azha knocks on the door, several celebrities shared their childhood memories of this festival with the daily star. here's what they had to say:
doobshatar
impress telefilm ltd premiered its 61st production “doobshatar” on november 13. the event was held at the channel i centre in tejgaon, dhaka. the film, directed by nurul alam atiq, follows a young middleclass woman and the predicaments she faces in the society.
fundraiser for chhayanaut teacher bipul bhattacharya
to raise funds for the ailing singer bipul bhattacharya, cultural organisation and music school chhayanaut arranged a special musical programme at the main auditorium of chhayanaut shangskriti bhaban in dhanmondi, dhaka on november 13.

handloom fair in mymensingh
a month-long handloom and handicrafts fair at the premises of district mohila krira shangstha, in town, concludes on november 16, a day before eid-ul-azha. view the page op-ed
the eviction and the hartal
was this haste necessary? if it was a purely legal issue between the opposition leader begum khaleda zia and the cantonment board, then there was no need for the ruling party to make any comment on the issue from the beginning. sadly, the people's reading of the entire development over khaleda zia's cantonment residence is quite different. leaders of the ruling awami league (al) have been on various occasions in the habit of attacking the opposition leader on the issue. at the al-organised political gatherings the issue has come up again and again. so, it would be naïve to think that the people at large will like to look at khaleda zia's eviction from her cantonment house as purely a matter of legal battle between khaleda zia as an individual and the plaintiff, the cantonment board. on the contrary, the popular perception of what happened on november 13 at the cantonment residence of the opposition leader will be seen as a nasty outcome of politics of hatred between the two major political parties of the country.
welfare of migrant workers
remittances from bangladeshi migrants have been growing rapidly over the past decade and a half, contributing significantly to economic growth and substantially improving the nation's balance of payments position. however, the recent global recession has caused dramatic losses in employment opportunities for bangladeshi migrants, not only in the form of reduced job availability but also in the form of massive layoffs among the current labour force. while remittances increased until 2009, the drastically lower numbers of new migrants has already resulted in reduced remittances during the first months of 2010.
the korean miracle
as far as miracle stories of growth go, few can elicit as much wonder and admiration as the korean one. more specifically, the story of the rise and rise, over the last three decades, of south korea, a country of rare beauty and absolute sophistication nestled on the southern tip of the korean peninsula.
