obama . . . and all those faltering american presidents
after the euphoria of the election, it is now time for barack obama to prepare to govern. for a man who has held no executive office, who has been a senator for only four years, obama will need to climb a mountain. that is no hint, though, that he will falter, that he might stumble and, indeed, will not be able to live up to the high hopes he has aroused in all americans.
outsider hopes
obama's ascent to power in the us is an occasion where the use of clich√©s cannot be avoided. it is a historic occasion. he has successfully crossed many divides in american politics: there were racial and economic disparities and, of course, partisanship. he is the best president that america can have according to most other nations, including those in south asia.

bring back hartal!
i don't know about you people, but i am really bored. there is nothing exciting going on in bangladesh these days. our cricketers have been winning disappointments rather than trophies; our politicians have all been absent from the tv screen (due to no fault of their own, as we all know!); and all our extortionist brothers are playing hide-n-seek in kolkata. (why is it that as soon as our people become experts in a particular field, they move abroad? no wonder we have a huge brain-drain in our country.) adding insult to injury, we have even turned our backs on our favourite pastime: hartal. shock! horror! what dark future are we leaving for our children? they are growing up without knowing anything about hartal. remember the old proverb "vath, mas ar hartalay bangali"?
bangladesh bank's initiatives
the annual average rate of inflation is increasing. the government expects inflation rate to come down in this fiscal year. but the market is yet to see any downward inflationary trend. money supply is continuing to increase, causing an increase in price level. bangladesh bank (bb) has to manage money supply in such a way that it does not squeeze the availability of funds for business and industry. it should encourage investments in productive sectors. it should consider lowering of interest rate while governments across the world are reducing the interest rate to make funds available to people.
an inspiring leader
this is a unique moment. for the first time in the history of america an african american has become the president. we were supporting and hoping that a change would come and this man, who struggled so much in life coming from a broken home and living in extreme poverty, would win back the white house for the democrats. he stood up against all odds and stiff opposition to win this historic election. he galvanized the whole nation and got the young and old, whites and blacks all engaged in this process to help him get elected so that he could bring about a change in america and get it out of its crisis. he inspired the people and even those beyond america's borders. he displayed a rare quality and that was perseverance. even in the face of verbal attacks, diatribes and racial slogans against him he did not retaliate and never slugged, all throughout the long campaign of almost two years. he really deserves accolade for that, especially when political campaigns are always very nasty. obama has also proved that despite poverty and hardship a man can achieve what he wants to if he desires. all he needs is hard work and faith. he proved that education is the most powerful tool and he pursued it in the most difficult conditions and reached the top. i sincerely hope he will turn america around and bring about a change, which was his election campaign motto. it is a huge victory for him and a mandate for change.
bnp's game plan
if from today the whole world accepts the present "east as west and west as east" the sun from tomorrow will start rising in the west and setting in the east. the truth is, the names of directions or existence of any thing that we call remain the same because names of all stars and planets are given by homo-sapiens and each member of this species call each of their names in their own languages. the objects do not change only the names do. whatever the uncompromising leader of the bnp says is correct and there can be no change. now she has said that no fair election is possible under this government and the cec because both the institutions are playing different games. according to bnp chairperson and its sg the government and the ec are preparing different playing fields for different parties.
cricketers treated shabbily
it is really unfortunate to find out the kind of shabby treatment handed out to our national cricket team by cricket south africa (csa). according to media reports ‚Äúplayers and officials had to stay five hours in the team hotel lobby on november 2 before being checked in after a fourteen-hour journey‚Äù (ds nov.7). and this was not the end. further reports add that ashraful and razzak were kept waiting on the dais for forty-five minutes only to be informed that there would be no post-match briefing! such negligent and irresponsible treatment that our players have received is simply unacceptable. whenever south africa (or any other foreign cricket team) come to bangladesh, they always receive warm hospitality and have been well looked after by our cricket authorities.
