please don't criminalise the homeless
on august 25, 2011, with little debate or public consultation, the bangladesh jatiya sangsad (parliament) passed the vagrant and shelterless persons (rehabilitation) act 2011. even our civil society did not discuss the issue much.
hunger-free bangladesh first
the people of bangladesh voted the al to power hoping that they would get at least three square meals, not for having a digital bangladesh. but the reality is different. the prices of the necessary commodities have increased so much that now it seems that sky is the limit. the government has totally failed to control the price hike and is trying to compensate by saying that the prices of necessary commodities are much higher in the neighbouring countries! possibly they mistakenly wrote in their election manifesto that they would feed people rice at taka.10/- per kg! on the other hand, interestingly enough, the prices of shares are decreasing alarmingly. if this trend continues, common people like us would not have any other option left other than committing suicide. the people of bangladesh don't bother whether the country is digital or analogue, instead they demand very little from the government. they want to get relief from the curse of hunger. we know that 'a hungry man is an angry man.' it will be impossible for the government to remain in power if the hungry people of bangladesh become angry.
waste management
dhaka is one of the most densely populated cities of the world. here a huge amount of waste is produced every day. these waste materials are creating environmental pollution (such as air pollution, water pollution, soil pollution, etc.), and interrupting the waste water flow through drains, blocking those. so, proper waste management is necessary to avoid these adverse impacts on the environment and human health.

blessing to hamas?
the recent israel-palestine prisoner exchange may be a positive sign for the region, though many fear prisoners' regression, increased hostage tactics and a supposed pr defeat for israel. what may be interesting to ponder is the israeli decision to negotiate with hamas.
ban on private coaching
it is really appreciable that the government is seriously considering imposing a ban on private coaching outside the classroom by school and college teachers. we hope that the high court directive in this respect will be implemented without further delay. it is a common allegation that most of the teachers are involved in private tuition. but i think this is a wrong perception.
the daily star polls
is anyone in the upper echelons of government appreciating how its polls on public opinion reflecting people's pulse is being made available to them every day on the burning topics constantly agitating their minds? admittedly, the ds polls do not cover too many people. but i am in no doubt that this small percentage represents the very cream of society -- the literate, thinkers, doers and the dedicated. the topics are all of current interest.
our duty as muslims
i am writing this letter to address the entire muslim community to be united. i ask the muslims how many times a day do we watch cnn or bbc to get the latest news? i am sure more than once every day. but how many of us spare five minutes from our busy schedule to read the glorious quran and its meaning? our duty as muslims is not confined only to remain true to the five pillars of islam, we have a duty to our society also. we have to propagate messages of peace that islam teaches to help our brothers and sisters around the world. west is invading the muslim countries in the name of fighting terrorism. but does islam preach terrorism? definitely not. the news channels that i mentioned above are controlled by the west; hence they are spreading news which are in their favour. our innocent brothers are being killed, sisters are being raped, and instead of protesting those heinous acts, we are talking in favour of the oppressors because they have power. and if anyone dares to protest, the western media term him/her a terrorist. but we must protest, we must speak for our innocent brothers and sisters in iraq, afghanistan, palestine, etc. we must not be afraid of them, we must be afraid of the almighty allah only, for his wrath is very much greater than the threats of the west. let us unite to save our religion of peace, islam.
under the greenwood tree…
i was wondering whether pen is mightier than the sword. we have written umpteen letters and columns for the government to be conscious about our national interest but it all fell on deaf ears. the news that india has already started using trial tax-free transit facility has taxed my brain so numb that i am unable to think normally. i'm now convinced that the government will do whatever it wishes to do regardless of whatever is said and written in the media. however weird it may seem, people have planted paddy on a strip of broken ishwardi-kushtia highway. it is now time to turn all the dilapidated infrastructure into cowsheds and rifles into plows and hoes for boosting agricultural and livestock production. let us return to the shakespeare's garden of arden where there is no enemy but bad weather and sing merrily- under the greenwood tree/who loves to lie with me...

gaddafi and all those nasty men
muammar gaddafi's was a sorry end, macabre in its dimensions and tormenting in its imagery. for many around the world, he deserved to be pushed from power, for all the right reasons. but he certainly did not deserve the collective villainy that was visited upon him in the last few moments of his life. that he concealed himself inside a sewer pipe, in the hope that no one would find him, was a clear demonstration of the principle on which irony usually works. towards the end of his regime and even after he had been run out of tripoli, he kept to his belief that those who were busy trying to topple him were rats. in the end, it was he who was caught in rat-like behaviour. even so, those who kill a rat are not men who teach us anything edifying about life.
