tax non-motorised vehicles
at present, there are too many non-motorised vehicles that ply the streets of dhaka. they are usually driven by people who have neither license nor knowledge or consideration for traffic rules and regulations. i believe they should be forced to pay road taxes. just imagine, if these rules were enforced upon them, how many of them would really ply our roads? everybody keeps blaming the motorised vehicles for causing traffic jams and congestions, but in the end it is really these vehicles that are the major source of revenue collection by brtc, and with this money roads are built and repaired. since the non-motorised vehicles are also enjoying road facilities, i think they should also pay their fair share of taxes and other fees. i also feel these vehicles must go for fitness inspections and must be insured.
broiler chicken: is it safe to eat?
is broiler chicken safe to eat? we all know about bird flu, but now the new concern is the “antibiotic medicines” that are essential to keep the chickens in the poultry farms alive. we have come to know that every poultry farm nowadays is using many kinds of antibiotics including renamicin, ciprofloxacin, eritromicin, colistin, ctt, etc. poultry farm owners say that it is not possible to keep the broiler chickens alive without vaccination. when antibiotic is given to a chicken, eating of that chicken remains prohibited for three to seven days. because antibiotic remains active in the chicken's body for some days. its impact does not go even if we cook it in 100 degree centigrade. if we eat this recently vaccinated chicken, antibiotic enters our body and bone-marrow and weaken our tissue cells and immune system. as a result, when we will grow older we will become weaker and many disorders will start to develop in our body. but the chicken sellers are still selling the recently injected broiler chickens.
