stop power and water wastage
bangladesh is suffering from power shortage not only because less power is being produced but also because we are running short of responsibility and patriotism. i found that almost in every house and office people keep the switch of fan, air cooler and electric bulb on even if there is nobody in the room. in summer, men wear suit and tie and use ac and they use it even in winter.

trial of drought-tolerant african rice
the news item by mr. sohel published in your daily on 24 april 2012 about the field trial of 'nerica', a warda-developed african rice variety, says it is a commendable step for boosting rice production in the aus season of bangladesh. among the rice growing seasons, aus is the most vulnerable one and offers low yield per unit of land. the aus crop faces drought problem at the beginning but may face flash flood at the flowering time. most of our traditional aus varieties possess quite a good grade of resistance to both the problems. but their yield is not satisfactory. that is why farmers are switching over to grow boro crop in some aus fields wherever irrigation facilities are available. another problem is the attack of pests and diseases at the ripening stage, when the field is very humid.

disgusting tv serials
it is not understandable why the zee bangla serials are becoming so popular in our country. we can not watch any other programmes because other members of our families keep glued to the tv set for hours to watch these serials. the stories simply do not advance. and there are commercials come after very short intervals. but the directors deserve praise because they know how to keep attention of the viewers.

vanishing makes it visible
pardon me for mixing apple with orange, the political controversy surrounding the disappearance of bnp leader ilyas ali reminded me of what french philosopher jean baudrillard said many years ago: “at the heart of pornography is sexuality haunted by its own disappearance,” he observed, which has an uncanny resonance to what we saw last week. at the heart of our politics was wisdom haunted by its own disappearance. it was not just that a politician was missing from us. politics itself was missing as well.
playing the violence card
ever since the culture wars of the 1980s, americans have been familiar with "the race card" -- an epithet used to discredit real and imagined cries of racism. less familiar, however, is an equally cynical rhetorical tactic that i call "the violence card."
thirsting for trouble
the way ilias ali has "disappeared" could make houdini turn in his grave. the vanishing tricks that made the hungarian-born us magician larger than life had to do with his sleight of hands. what couldn't have been in houdini's bag of tricks is the calculated, coldhearted cloak-and-dagger vanishing act performed by his bangladeshi disciples on bnp organising secretary ilias ali and his driver.
the tiger of bengal
bangladesh remembers today a great hero, a giant among men, who passed away on this day in 1962. the whole nation honours and respects and admires this brave son of bengal because he loved peace and did everything in his power to avert calamities; because he merited the high and exalted position; because he promoted the prosperity of his country; because he was regardless of personal gains and cheerfully endured all toil and hardship so that he could elevate the masses of mankind; because he had a high sense of honour, respected the rights of conscience, and nobly advocated equality of privileges and the universal brotherhood of man; because he had an unshakable faith in islam but never spoke ill of any other religion; because he was a man of the people. and bangladeshis believe that he was one of us and that he was for us. yes, sher-e-bangla a.k. fazlul huq, whose death anniversary we observe today, really gave enormously of himself to people, and he really loved people.
personal social responsibility
to be quite honest about it, bangladeshi people as a nation show up poorly in regard to philanthropy. when faced with this statement many apparently knowledgeable persons take to the plea that they lack enough resources with which to engage themselves in such activities.
