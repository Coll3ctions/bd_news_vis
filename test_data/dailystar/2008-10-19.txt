abandoning the sculpture project
the removal of five baul sculptures, including that of lalon shah, from around the traffic intersection in front of zia international airport under threats from a group of zealots flies in the face of our commitment to age-old cultural and religious values and pride in our national heritage. there may have been genuine questions about the aesthetic deficit, flawed design or lack of proportion in the cluster of structures raised, but the real reason for which these have been ultimately pulled down is far more insidious and unacceptable than any artistic naivete or design fault. this is pure genuflection before the forces of orthodoxy topped off by some ulterior political motives that the nation needs to take guard against.
the unending crisis in thailand
the political crisis in thailand appears to have taken on increasingly serious overtones. ever since the army overthrew thaksin shinawatra in 2006, bangkok has gone from one governmental experiment to another, with of course the soldiers playing a clear role in the process. the fact that the judiciary at one point banned thaksin's thai rak thai party did not deter his followers from quickly forming another and romping home to victory in a new election. but that was swiftly followed by an opposition campaign aimed at toppling the new government. eventually, it was on a technicality (the prime minister was found guilty of conflict of interest by taking part in a television culinary programme) that the courts ordered the head of government out of office. meanwhile, thaksin shinawatra and his wife, having travelled to china on bail to watch the olympics, suddenly made their way to britain, where they have now sought political asylum.

too late for a two-state solution

environmental degradation
the world is getting alarmingly warmer. on the other hand, all the major factors of our environment like air, water are getting polluted badly. we really do not care about our environment.
election debate
let me begin by saying that it gave me great pleasure reading what appeared in a front page article of your daily on 15 october 2008, “with the completion of the electoral roll with photograph, bangladesh is now also the proud owner of the world's largest electronic database of 8.11 crore voters” this is really commendable.
easing traffic jam
numerous reports and letters appear almost regularly in your daily relating to frustrating traffic jams in dhaka city and valuable time lost by commuters. one may observe that even if there are only ten cars on the road the drivers will block each other on red signal without any consideration to which way they will go on green signal. i personally believe if some common sense approach is applied and strictly implemented by the police, there is every possibility that traffic jam will be eased. there are a few basic traffic rules that should be strictly adhered to and the violators must be punished with heavy fines. first, all roads must have two lanes, one for vehicles that intend to take a left turn and another for vehicles intending to go straight or turn right. no u turns or changing lanes, even if one lane is empty, should be allowed. for buses to drop or pick up passengers a parking bay should be created at all bus stoppages. heavy fines should be imposed for illegal parking. by the way, let illegal parking be handled by a private company as done in london.
thoughts on cricket
the two-page report on the round table on cricket covered a fairly wide range of cricket related issues. this letter reflects my opinions, related to some of the matters discussed, along with some memories from the past which were not well covered in the discussions! the last time i played cricket, was way back in the 1960s in friendly inter-project games while in khulna newsprint mills, which in those days had a regular cricket pitch!
corruption everywhere!
congratulations to mr. wahid for his article (october 7th) 'the toll collectors are here', which explained to us how corruption actually works and how it can get such a grip on our society.
callous doctors
the consumer society in bangladesh is constantly being cheated and deprived of services due to lack of awareness and accountability. i would like to share my bitter experience of a malpractice in what i think is a violation of consumer rights. it was last wednesday evening when i drove all the way to a hospital in uttara to get medical care for my wife. i enquired if gynaecologists were available for consultation, paid the fee for “fast-track” service and walked my ailing wife up to the doctor's chamber hoping to get some kind of speedy service and proper care for my time and money's worth. as we approached the chamber a matron took the slip from our hands, motioned us towards an empty lounge saying, “the doctor is attending to other patients, i will call you as soon as she is done with them,” and vanished inside the doctor's room. we waited in good faith, counting the minutes as my wife shifted uncomfortably in her chair in pain. i walked up and down the lounge looking at new patients arrive, go in and come out through another chamber close by, but neither our doctor nor our matron ever materialized to deliver that “fast-track” service we paid for. when it seemed we had had enough of waiting i managed to draw the attention of the neighbouring doctor's matron and solicited her help. this brought our matron out of the room just to let us know that the doctor was still looking at patients and we had to wait further. there was something strange in her attitude which made my wife ask, “is the doctor in her chamber at all?” to this the matron, surprisingly replied, “actually…no, she is in the ward now, but don't worry she will be right back.” i wanted to know when she would return, again came the matron's vague reply, “probably half an hour,” and looking at my face turning red in anger, quickly corrected herself, “no, maybe five to ten minutes, please wait.” i decided not to and ran downstairs and asked the guy behind the counter to cancel my slip and issue me a new one for the other doctor who was truly available. the man reluctantly looked at his computer screen and said, “don't think i can do that, you have already made payment and the record has been saved in our system, it will be a big hassle if you want to change doctors now.” i asked how could we see the doctor when she was not in. it suddenly dawned on me that here i was talking to an accomplice because he wasn't supposed to issue me the slip in the first place. sensing that he was close to getting into trouble, the guy hurriedly got hold of the missing doctor on telephone telling her that her patients were about to leave. an animated conversation followed and to my utter surprise i overheard that our doctor was actually not even in the premises but away in a totally different hospital!! as if this was not enough, the guy reported that the doctor wanted us to wait for “just” ten more minutes by which time she would be right back! i was appalled at the unscrupulous practice and lack of professionalism from someone in the ranks of a teacher in a medical university. what is even more appalling is that at a time when we have started to lose hope in our public hospitals, the private ones remain our last resort and if they follow suit, i guess our last vestige of hope would be gone and it would be no surprise if people rush to bangkok, bangalore or even kolkata for treatment.
population boom
i am amazed at the total lack of any concern whatsoever in bangladesh about the menacing problem of population boom. that this menace is eating away at whatever little progress we have hitherto made does not seem to attract the attention of anyone either in the media, or the social elite, intellectuals, policy makers, think tanks, and least of all, the politicians. the discussions day in and day out revolve around elections or hasina /khaleda and their activities.
unbearable…
this incident occurred a month ago. i was standing in the balcony looking at the starry sky and recalling past memories. i was brought back from my dream world by the sudden crashing sound of a car. hearing the sound my mother came rushing to the balcony asking me what's the matter. after a long time i came to know that a sports-car hit the cart of a chotpotiwala while the car hit one of the walls. within a few minutes the car took a reverse gear and sped away. in the meantime the people gathered around the chotpotiwala. no one bothered to take the man to hospital. unable to bear the anger anymore i called the security guard to know what was going on there. he replied that the chotpotiwala was dead. putting a decent suit on, i ran downstairs. one more shocking news was awaiting me. god bless me! the chotpotiwala was the same man from whom i used to have chotpoti regularly. he was very excited as his daughter-in-law gave birth to a son. the police arrived and took his corpse away. suddenly something caught my attention. one of his fists was tightly clutched to something. on opening his fist, i saw that it was a toy. oh dear! rubbing the tears of my eyes i walked along the path of the most ruthless, arrogant and vicious country!
asian highway network
a report in your daily of 12.10.08 indicates that bangladesh is in danger of missing the right to join the asian highway network (ahn) due to its inability so far to meet the deadline for signing the ahn agreement. a direct access to this 1,41, 000 km long transport artery across asia up to europe and the wide network of roads coupled to it, without the slightest doubt, is of great importance for trade, commerce and tourism in bangladesh, no less than that of all the participating countries and beyond. although bangladesh by historical inheritance was one of the founding members of the asian highway network, it has lost that status in the meantime by failing to sign up in 2005, and now it has a mere observer status. bangladesh will be a total outsider if it fails to sign up the agreement this time as well.
the citizenship issue
on 18 march 2008, chief adviser dr. fakhruddin ahmed stated at a news conference in london that bangladeshis holding british passports would retain their bangladeshi citizenship automatically unless one relinquishes one's allegiance to bangladesh 'voluntarily' (the daily star, 24 march 2008). by doing so the chief adviser has provided the correct interpretation of the bangladesh citizenship (temporary provisions) order 1972 (p.o. n. 149 of 1972) , further amended by the ordinance no. vii of 1978 which under clause 2b states, " a citizen of bangladesh shall not, merely by reason of being a citizen or acquiring citizenship of a state specified in or under clause (2) [i.e., any state of europe or north america], cease to be a citizen of bangladesh". this position of the government of bangladesh is accepted by a number of governments of europe including sweden. this was confirmed in a communication from the director of citizenship, government of sweden, on 2nd february 1989 that stated , " the legal text shall be interpreted such as that a citizen of bangladesh who obtains citizenship of a european or a north american state can retain the bangladeshi citizenship". since a bangladeshi citizen does not lose his/her bangladeshi citizenship by acquiring the citizenship of a european state such as sweden, the question of applying for a citizenship of bangladesh after acquiring citizenship of a european state is irrelevant and redundant. view the page international
