partition of india
the main problems of population migration that arose from the independence of the indian sub-continent from the british rule was not the creation of india and pakistan as such. jinnah wanted partition of the country into pakistan and india, mainly on religious grounds, but he also argued fiercely with mountbatten and his advisers (i read in one of mountbatten's biographies that the argument at the final stages of independence went through a whole night), against partition of the provinces of bengal and punjab and demanded that these two muslim majority provinces which had existed for many years with their democratic provincial legislatures and governments must remain in tact and be allocated to pakistan. mountbatten was adamant that if religion was the basis to divide the country as a whole then the same principle must be applied to these provinces as well.

australian polls

europe and india
regarding the 'independence' of india and pakistan, i have to mention that 'undivided' india or bharat was always independent and had outstanding economic, academic and cultural excellence until the 'british traders' arrived. after the british finished 'trading and ruling' the foundation was laid not for 2 but 3 countries: india, pakistan and bangladesh. unfortunately, b'desh became the youngest child abandoned at birth by a large family although once bengal was one of the richest regions on earth. today the european colonialists, once racing to grab the indian resources, are united under 'eu'. but there is also a mighty shine fiercely emerging from the united south asian platform under 'saarc'.
medical admission test
it is known that the scapegrace will never listen to moral lectures. if proper justice is ensured and all possible loopholes are sealed, the members of society would not have thought of it. but unfortunately so far as it is known, nobody dared to take proper actions against the unscrupulous vicious circles existing in the safe zone except little eyewash.
enforcement of law
it has been noticed that due to the failure of the authorities to enforce any law , public respect for its compliance is eroding fast. people do not seem to show any respect for any law as they can get away with the violation easily. for example, an anti-smoking law was promulgated long ago prohibiting public smoking. but has it been implemented? the answer is a big no. because there is no authority to implement this law. recently, horn free zones were declared for some particular streets and places in the city. but the drivers of the vehicles are not showing any respect for the law and there is no one to enforce it. as a result, hooting is rampant in those restricted areas. the traffic authorities now have come up with another directive prohibiting use of mobile phone or ear phone while driving. but as usual this directive is also totally ignored in the absence of any attempt to enforce its implementation.

'headless horseman?'
i just finished reading the article 'headless horseman?' by shahnoor wahid on the ds issue of 18toctober, 2007. i must first congratulate the writer for brilliantly portraying the prevailing truth in politics of bangladesh. his last comments on questioning the three leaders to speak on behalf of bangladesh are worth noting. in spite of 1/11, the politicians are simply playing the blame game and honestly trying to show their innocence for the fear of being booked by the acc or some governmental agency. truly, it is nonsensical to line up behind these people who had marauded and defrauded the nation for so long and in such unceremonious way that i am revisited by a spine chilling specter of pre 1/11 days and my blood pressure shoots up.
smuggling into jail!
an illuminating front page report on the matter was published in a local english daily after eid. the report is a proof of bad habits leading towards criminality, even in so-called high society! it is astonishing to even think of "phensidyl mixed semai"; an unholy concoction, even on a holy day like eid.

bangabandhu and bangladesh
it was a delightful morning for me to see the coverage and the picture of three chiefs of armed forces, the president and the chief adviser paying tribute to our father of the nation on the 32nd anniversary of the assassination of bangabandhu. bangabandhu and bangladesh are synonymous. general moeen and his colleagues have displayed maturity and good sense. let us not disgrace the father of the nation anymore. during the time when awami league was in power bangabandhu's image was restored to some extent.
nbr chairman
change of nbr chairman is a routine function . but it is news since people feel that the immediate past chairman was talking too much, which was beyond the normal discipline of a bureaucrat.
caretaker government
since january 2007, this caretaker government has only been doing one single thing: cracking down on the politicians. they are only focused on arresting the corrupt politicians and business people. it is a good thing but after they came to power it is their only mission. they are not at all concerned about other major issues concrning the development of the country. the rab and police are doing nothing to stop crimes. prices of essential commodities are increasing day by day at an alarming rate. the entire nation is suffering from power failure. if electricity is not available 3--4 hours a day, then how will it be possible for business people to compete with the rest of the world?
police administration
mr. nurul huda's incisive observations on police management (oct:20) present the pragmatic realities of facts as practiced in bangladesh. the prime goal is "non-accounting cash flow". this prime goal covers everyone in the hierarchy; except a few, too few; honourable people; who therefore become misfits in the highly efficiently managed and well developed "cash flow" system. view the page international

is it not yet time for justice?
almost three years have passed without a proper investigation into the brutal killing of my husband shah a.m.s. kibria, m.p., in a grenade attack in his habiganj constituency on january 27, 2005. my nephew, shah manzur huda, and three others were also killed in the attack. like me, so many wives, mothers and children who have lost loved ones in grenade and bomb attacks still cry in anguish, with the forlorn hope of justice. so many families have been torn apart by these attacks. for these families there can never again be carefree laughter and joy -- the dark shadow of these brutal killings will haunt them for the rest of their lives, a constant source of sorrow and depression. the great shame is that they are even denied the scant consolation of knowing that the killers will be brought to justice. view the page star city
