cht's potential for development still unrealised
the chittagong hill tracts with their natural endowment of resources make up a region that is capable of firing the imagination of any development planner with a vision. apart from its contoured topography, home to a rich bio-diversity of flora and fauna, being an environmental asset and tourist attraction in its own right, the potentialities for economic development the hill districts have are also immense. but unfortunately, all of this enormous possibility of the region, has hardly ever crossed the academic threshold, the rhetoric wish-list, as it were.
disaster issues in school curriculum
the idea of introducing disaster-related issues in school curricula surely promises to bring a new dimension to education in the country. for a developing nation such as ours, the ubiquity of problems it faces calls for new and sometimes radical approaches toward a resolution. that necessarily brings the question of the school syllabi into focus. we are of the opinion that the national convention on monday on disaster risk reduction through schools is a step in the right direction and one that should lead to other and meaningful steps where imbuing the young with new ideas is concerned.

violation of ethnic rights
no doubt, we are a peaceful nation, and even the people across the globe recognize us likewise until they find the report in which thousands of ethnic people are stated to have been attacked by a group of musclemen. when i looked at the report, and thereby knew that some local musclemen led by one nur hossain master demolished a community in which indigenous people live in, the whole thing stopped me for a while, as i was thinking about the national identity. at the same time, it was haunting me, i wanted to know the multiple answers: why did thousands of people lose their accommodation rights? why were they oppressed severely by the land grabbers? why did the attackers damage and torch their homes? where is the provision to stop the heinous crime?
prices of essentials
the prices of commodities increase higher and higher day by day. if the price of a particular commodity increases by a certain percentage, then it never gets back to its previous position, regardless of what is happening in the market. the price of a particular product will be estimated at the equilibrium level where the supply and demand intersects. but the prices in our country fly much higher than the equilibrium level. greater demand and lower supply is one of the major reasons of price increase. there are also some natural and man-made causes which play their due role in price increase. natural causes like floods and droughts are unpredictable and we need to be prepared for that. apart from natural causes, man made causes increase the prices and a particular group of people take advantage of increasing price level. it is quite common that the prices of essentials increase in the holy month of ramadan. certain commodities are used mostly in ramadan for preparing iftar, but what's the reason behind increasing the prices of other commodities? the government has asked tcb to import several essentials which are consumed mostly in ramadan to ensure smooth supply.
role of ict
finance minister ama muhith has stressed the role of ict in creating a corruption free country while speaking at a seminar in sylhet on digital bangladesh. he raised different issues and sectors that can benefit through creation of a digital country. though it is a bit late, the initiative taken by the minister is appreciable. it will be wise for all members of parliament (mps) to follow him and arrange similar seminars and workshops in their respective constituencies or regions. the seminars and workshops should be held in local institutions like schools (general, vocational and madrasah), colleges, institutes and universities. not only the students and teachers will attend but the local people must be invited and encouraged to attend the events. the most important thing is to raise awareness among common people about the benefits of ict which is the main tool for a digital country. once they make up their minds to take such initiatives, experts from the respective regions will come out to cooperate and to lead the programme further. they can be termed as the hidden human resources for the region. their expertise can be utilized for the welfare of the localities.
digital results

constructive criticism
constructive criticism is very important both at individual and national levels. it is said that my critic is my best friend. it is very natural that people make mistakes knowingly or unknowingly while performing their duties and critics help them to be on the track by pointing out the wrongs. unfortunately, we as a nation have very little power of tolerance and that's why we react very sharply to the slightest criticism we get from our opponents. the political parties show very little endurance which is of great importance in maintaining peace and harmony in society.
bnp's mistakes
this is nothing but public perception of political events unfolding in bangladesh. the bnp has made a political mistake by not attending parliament on a flimsy ground of 'front row seats' they have now committed the most irreparable political blunder by refusing to participate in the parliamentary team that went to tipaimukh on a fact finding mission. the non-cooperation by the opposition parties is only strengthening the hands of the indian government to deal with the issue of tipaimukh in their own way.

ice to burn?
gas hydrates look like ordinary ice crystal, and burn like many conventional fossil fuels. they are crystalline compounds formed from water cages stabilized by guest molecules such as methane, ethane etc. usually at low temperature and high pressure. one unit volume of gas hydrate provides as much as 160 volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure. gas hydrates therefore have been considered as one of the potential energy resources. since the 3rd decade of the last century gas hydrates have been paid special attention due to their potential to block the oil and gas flow lines. beside the energy concern, gas hydrates show various beneficial applications such as water desalination, gas storage and transportation of methane. the see floor and permafrost regions set optimum temperature-pressure conditions for the natural occurrences of gas hydrates. recent reviews on the concerned subject show that more than 90 sites on the globe have been directly (experimental evidence) or indirectly (geophysical data analysis) identified to contain natural gas hydrates. current estimates show hydrates could contain from 10(to power 15) to 10(to power 17) m3 of methane at standard temperature and pressure.

seasonal anger?
due to heavy downpour almost the whole of the city of dhaka was inundated on july 28, 2009. life came to a standstill. millions of city dwellers were in deep trouble. prime minister sheikh hasina, like all her former ceos of bangladesh, lost her patience and summoned all the ministers and bosses of the concerned departments and organisations to her office to give them a bit of her mind. it all came in the media next day. we, the ordinary citizens of dhaka, felt satisfied that the matter has been noted by the prime minister. like every time in the past, this time too, our hopes will run high. but shall we be disappointed again like it happened umpteen times in the past ? shall the govt take stern actions this time against those land grabbers, corrupt bureaucrats and insincere politicians who make a natural disaster more disastrous by human machinations? or, shall we have to wait for the next year when the prime minister will again show her anger and displeasure to her ministers and officers on the same issue? view the page international
