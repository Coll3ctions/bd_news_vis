driving mr. dad
i have sweet memories of driving a car in dhaka. the car we owned was a small one, a morris minor, which my father had purchased second-hand when he was stationed in dinajpur. however, abba did not drive; and, while he had six sons, we were all very young when the morris minor joined our family. soon thereafter, my older brother and i got our “learner's permit”--nonetheless, keeping a driver was still considered a necessity to take abba to work and take us places. after i got my driver's license, i would always be on the lookout for an opportunity when the family car might be available, and take it out for a spin. initially, i'd have an escort, the family driver, but soon i would take the car out all by myself and drive around in the ramna area where we lived, or in the dhaka university area where i was studying.

the turbid waters in which a society wallows
thirty six years ago bangladesh started its journey as a nation-state with great promise of a common national identity, democracy, social and economic justice, and religious non-discrimination or secularism. soon the high ideals of the war of liberation were vitiated by the seizure of state power by counter-revolutionary forces. the country went under military rule for 15 years following the coup d'etat of august 1975. it experienced changes of the governance system a number of times multiparty parliamentary democracy (1972-1974) to one-party presidential system (1975); military rule (1975-1990); again, multi-party parliamentary system (1991-to date). democratic institutions, values, traditions, practices and procedures can hardly grow in such an unstable situation. the re-introduction of the multi-party parliamentary system in 1991 did not improve the overall situation much. for five consecutive years, both under the bnp and awami league government, bangladesh topped the transparency international list as the most corrupt country in the world. elections scheduled to be held in january 2007 could not take place because of disagreement between the two major power contending parties around the composition of the caretaker government, election commission and necessary electoral reforms.
