we condemn the bomb blast that occurred in the indian tourist city of jaipur a couple of days ago. a previously-unknown militant group has claimed responsibility for a string of blasts that killed 63 people. this is an act of barbarism. whoever has done this barbaric act should be brought to justice. how long will the peace-loving ordinary citizens continue to suffer?
medical college
recently, the government declared that five medical colleges would be set up in the country. we welcome this decision and hope the government will soon establish a medical college in kushtia which has been the demand of the local people for a long time. in june 1980, the then president of the country had laid the foundation stone of this much cherished medical college, which is yet to be built. there is a general hospital in kushtia with two hundred and fifty beds. a medical assistant training school and a nursing training centre are also there. so if a medical college is established, these buildings can be used for classes at the initial stage. the other infrastructure could be built gradually as there is no need to buy land, for the required land is already there. so, it would not cost a lot of money to start a medical college here which could serve the poor and unfortunate people of this district with good treatment facilities.
rice production
