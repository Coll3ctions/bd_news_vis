sheikh hasina's welcome return
we welcome sheikh hasina back to the country after her medical treatment abroad, consigning any speculation mongering to the bin. with the election schedule having been announced and the emergency relaxed, the country is set on the election track. the awami league chief's return adds to the fullness of the electoral atmosphere. her presence and leading the party up front rather than from a long distance would surely help invigorate the party and steer it steadily on course to the upcoming general election.
the sordid happenings at bsmmu
the removal a few days ago of some senior officials, including the vice chancellor, of bangabandhu sheikh mujib medical university on charges of irregularities brings to light the questionable manner in which the institution was being run. when bsmmu began its journey, it did so with high hopes about offering excellence in medical education and research. however, in recent years there have been allegations of a politicisation of the bsmmu administration, with the result that the organisation has been in decline as far as medical education and the provision of services to patients are concerned. the recent instance of doctors at bsmmu producing a false medical certificate and without proper approval for a detained politician, to the effect that he needed to be treated outside, speaks volumes about things going wrong at the institution. there are set criteria about medical certification through a formation of medical boards that cannot and must not be disregarded.
