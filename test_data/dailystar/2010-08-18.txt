we welcome hc move on adulteration and prices
the high court directive to the police to file criminal cases under the special powers act of 1974 against those behind an adulteration of foodstuff and a spiralling of prices of essential commodities reflects the concerns of broad swathes of society about prevailing market conditions. it has been observed for a very long time and especially since the beginning of ramadan this year that traders have with impunity continued to raise the prices of goods, to the great discomfiture of citizens. at the same time, the fact that every so often reports surface about the adulteration of food items throws up the image of a situation which, unless it is handled firmly, will lead to a culture of impunity on the part of dishonest traders for whom nothing other than profiteering matters.
cng filling moratorium
impulsive response to a deep-seated crisis, be it handling traffic congestion or suspending cng gas filling for a big block of time appears to have been something of a signature emblem of governance. the ostensible purpose behind pre-mature closing down of educational institutions for the ramadan and eid and now behind the six-hourly daily prohibition of cng supply at the filling stations has a ring of 'yureka' chant about it. as though an answer to nagging civic problems has been ingeniously hit up on. panacea to long-standing diseases has been found at long last -- such is the self-congratulatory mode! but how are the organisations and users taking it? view the page sports

bcb and poor cricket
there is a proverb - “if you want to destroy an institution, appoint a politician as its head”. the situation is now heading towards this direction after the appointment of a politician to head the bcb. first of all, a change was made in the captaincy without any known reason. only explanation given was shakib's reported unwillingness to continue which the ex-captain later confirmed as correct. next came the controversy over the selection procedure. the selection committee has little say in selecting players which is reportedly dictated by a few influential people in the board supported by the chairman. the selection committee neither agreed nor disagreed to the news item published recently.
encroachment of roads
there is no sign that the present traffic jam situation will improve soon. and we can imagine the worst traffic jam in near future. the government has taken many steps to improve the traffic system in dhaka. but the ultimate result is zero. in my opinion, the main reason is - nobody follows the traffic rules and the traffic police also do not care about the traffic rules.
contradictions
i find myself confused by the present crisis in the rmg sector because of many contradictions. it is our major foreign exchange earner, largest employer, gives opportunities to women and generates huge revenue. unfortunately, this productive area is going through increasing unrest and violent upheavals. both workers and owners are unhappy. to a layman, with access to only what he reads or sees on tv, the causes are many and the old merry-go-round blame game is being played with full vigour by the three parties involved workers, owners and government.
campus violence
most of the public colleges and universities have become mini cantonments which are full of lethal weapons and ammunition. it is a great tragedy for the nation that the sanctity of the campuses of our educational institutions is being marred by violence. campus violence is a festering wound. the places of nation-building are now centres of terrorism. invaluable time, talent and money are being wasted by campus violence. the violence often forces the closure of the institutions and further worsens the already critical, session jam situation.
manikganj accident
the tragic accident at uthali, near manikganj, where two top bureaucrats were killed vividly exposes our inefficient road safety system. even the prime minister expressed her strong resentment. but result? in the following weeks casualty on road became higher. in reality other than expressing anger no positive step is taken to curb the killings. police commissioner has issued some directives which only increased confusion and anomalies on the road.

bnp's opinion
i am really happy to note the contents of public address of begum khaleda zia in her party's public rally at paltan on 9 august 2010. her whole speech was within usual accusations of government's failures and faults. most opposition parties in the world do the same as she has done. people also know this fact and did not take it seriously except few diehard supporters who are again out of income due to their party's present position and some media outlets which are projecting it as a threat and confusing the people.
promoting science education
a statistical finding has been published some days ago in an eminent bangla newspaper telling that the number of students in science group is going down drastically. students are now more interested to study in commerce group as they think that commerce-oriented courses, especially business administration, are more pro-career than science. it's no way the fault of our students to think that way as every human being considers his/her future. the mindset of the students can only be changed if they find bright career prospects in the science courses. the policymakers of the education system of our country should go for an overhaul in this sector. now, let's consider some backdrops of our science education on which they can work.
political compromise
in the month of ramadan we expect a political trade off since the elders are extending invitation for iftar. the opposition has already made a breakthrough in the process by making governance to a certain extent quite difficult for the present government. it is difficult to make any guess in the backdrop of poor performance in power sector and city management. to be straightforward, the al is in power but the bnp controls the strategic areas of governance by their loyal set ups in trade, commerce, power, rmg and what not.
price hike
it has become a tradition that in ramadan prices will hike on a galloping scale comparable to other times. 'increasing demand' may be a cause. but is this the only one?
public transport system
once, i had a chance to go to mumbai and i was amazed by their transport system. they have good rail network to travel in the city. thousands of people are travelling by train to go to work or anywhere in the city all the time. for that reason, there is not much traffic on the road. view the page international
