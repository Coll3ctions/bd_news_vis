ekushey
language is regarded as the mainstay of a nation's culture. as an evil attempt to tarnish our culture, the erstwhile pakistanis tried to impose forcibly an alien language on us by effacing our glorious mother-tongue forever. but on that day our invincible people realized it and came forward to protect our language. the unprecedented incident of ekushey february is not merely an event but indicates a spirit that we got 57 years ago through the sublime sacrifice of those valiant sons of our soil.
early marriage
the state of getting married before being mature enough to get married is simply referred to as early marriage. like most of the countries in the developing world, adolescent and child marriage in our country seem to be a strong social evil, mostly for girls living in rural areas. the young girls, the worst victims of forced marriage, are not having a sigh of relief from the malady of early marriage. statistics show that as many as 75 percent of rural girls in bangladesh get married before the age of 16 and only 5 percent between 18 and 20.

slow poisoning
once i had the opportunity to meet magistrate rokonuddolah and he said that in many food shops he had seen textile dye for mixing with sweets and other foods. like other children my children also love to eat coloured chocolates, sweetmeats, ice creams, soft drinks etc., some of which contain artificial dye. so i avoid giving them to my children. but many of my relatives and friends bring chocolates and ice creams for them. when my children take chocolates, i feel very helpless as i think they are taking poison. in my laboratory i have tested ice creams of some famous companies and some of them contain a huge number of bacteria-- much beyond the normal limit.
role of acc
i highly doubt whether the anti corruption commission (acc), would ever be able to cure bangladesh from corruption. it seems to me that the authority may not even be a kosher institution within itself and yet, it is supposed to deal with the problems of corruption. how could we expect an authority to be a prosecutor, jury and judge all at the same time? besides, where can we find such great flawless brave individuals, who will always do the right thing despite pressure from all corners? this was indeed a utopian and popular idea, to quick fix the corruption but it failed to account for the successful prosecution with evidence and subsequent punishment of the culprits. i am sorry i do not see the required quality and transparency with the current acc and that is why it is destined to fade away with the new democratic government. no doubt, the acc has exposed some cases of corruption but it also harassed a great number of people for no good reason.
in response...
i am referring to an article entitled “turkey's islamists show their hand”, where intriguingly the writer launched a campaign of fallacy.
call centres
recently, the ds reported that the potential call centre industry in bangladesh is facing a lot of policy hurdles. indisputably, it's our bad luck because we are unable to take this great opportunity. all over the world this is a growing industry, especially in the developing countries. the global market is worth $450 billion. how much percentage are we getting in this respect?
propaganda or facts?
the bnp secretary general seems to be upset, about lawmakers asking for information about koko's illegal money transfer and ex-pm's 400 pieces of luggage while going to saudi arabia! both the facts are verifiable and possibly on record. koko's money laundering and getting money from siemens was public news in us papers.
acc vs. government
there was front-page news in many bangla newspapers on 20 feb. under the heading "kar katha shattaya". many people, especially the ones who were charged, arrested and jailed for corruption were the most vocal against the acc chairman and dg.
digital bangladesh
the term "digital bangladesh" has become a common one in our national life these days. we frequently hear of this term but almost all of us are ignorant of what it actually means. it has become so frequently used a term that it has affected all. in the near past the word "digital" was only used to mean something modern.
withdraw restriction
the bangladeshi icl cricketers are still disallowed to play in any form of home cricket. sri lanka has already withdrawn the restriction on their icl cricketers. if bcb (bangladesh cricket board) gives them the permission to play in all forms of cricket, then our national team will become stronger. we must not forget that alok kapali, shahriar nafees and aftab ahmed played very well in icl.
morning shows….
it is just more than a month that the al-led grand alliance formed the government after its landslide victory in the last general election. against the opposition & some media reports & criticisms, sheikh hasina, the prime minister, told that it was too early to make any comments on the achievements of her government. this is very true but as the proverb goes that morning shows the day, the common people are losing their hearts. look at some news headings from ds in the last few days which are: school shut as al men occupy it for jatra, bcl dissolves ju unit after gunfight, mps shout, bang desk at js , local development to sink in mp meddling, panic spreads as law enforcement slackens, gun-running rampant along sw borders, truck looted by dinajpur bcl men, gang kills man & loots truckload of rods in n'ganj, mob clashes with bdr over smuggled goods etc. we see nothing bright!
language issue
reading your ekushey edition, i was struck, once more, with the strange contradiction between the genuine feeling for the celebration - its history and meaning - and the shame that admits how badly your mother language is often spoken, especially by the young. professor serajul islam choudhury, in particular, spoke of this and the resistance to bengali-speaking that exists among some who prefer english.
