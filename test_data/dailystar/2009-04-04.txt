hasan mashhud chowdhury's departure regrettable
it is with deep regret that we note the departure of hasan mashhud chowdhury from the anti-corruption commission (acc). the resignation of the acc chairman clearly raises a number of questions, the answers to which have not been provided by either chowdhury or the government. there is, though, the subtle feeling that not everything had been going well for the acc chief since the general elections in december despite his apparent belief that the new government would give him the cooperation necessary to continue the drive against corruption. the retired general met prime minister sheikh hasina and then emerged to tell waiting newsmen of the satisfactory nature of their talks.

what lies below
the pilkhana incident has restored mutiny and violent deaths to the centre of political discourse after many years. the role of institutions like the army and its auxiliaries like the bdr and the ansars have returned in full force, making everyone anxious to understand what they mean in terms of law and order stability and the character of the state institutions that house such forces.
chronicle of tragedy and the pendulum of sentiment
it was appalling to witness the fast swinging of the "sentiment pendulum" during the course of the bdr mutiny. when the first news of the mutiny broke, the sentiment pendulum decisively swung towards the mutineers, partly owing to their socio-economic background but mainly due to the stories of deprivation they managed to deliver to the public.
untangling the web
there is very little that one can add, at least nothing very insightful, to what has already been said and written on the bdr massacre. the opposition political parties have given their verdict on whom they think is responsible for it. and the al has come out with theories of its own, courtesy the daily comments on the investigation by the minister for commerce. however, there are differing views on several important aspect of the matter in the grand alliance, particularly between the al and its major component the jp, principally on how the matter should have been handled.
picking through the wreckage
the emerging conventional wisdom at the time of writing is that the events were premeditated, and not spontaneous. if this view is true, then it is important to scrutinise the rank and file of the bdr. failure to do this means we run the risk of a rebel soldier killing an indian officer during a flag meeting. the repercussions of such an incident could be far reaching indeed. and even if nothing like that happens, it seems difficult to ask a 25 year-old captain to command a bdr platoon in the remote border areas. it is no surprise then that officers are yet to join their men at camps. view the page urban

excuses
wine-ing
i accidentally came across this book on wines written by an indian in a kolkata bookshop, and then found to my surprise that it has actually been well received in the country. magandeep singh, a sommelier who's a consultant with hotels and restaurants, writes with humour and a light touch. in his introduction he confesses that he “was not a 'wine man' to begin with”, but persistence, curiousity and patience in the quest to understand what “it was about wine that was so mesmerizing” paid off at the end. the book is arranged in fourteen easy-to-read chapters, and clues in south asians starting to develop a taste for wine, or even ones who have been regularly drinking it without knowing much about it, about the fine art that lies behind selecting, palates, varieties, vintages, reds, whites, tasting, storing (the chapter is titled 'zen and the art of storing wine'), and even ways to handle the stress of surveying snooty wine lists. and much more. white wines, for example, should be served about one-third of the glass (never more!), and reds about two-thirds. why? so that each sip is at the right temperature! pour too much and halfway through “the wine starts to taste awful.” for south asians… well, for a transplanted one like me, however, the most interesting and informative parts are the chapters that deal with which wines to serve with indian food whites, a floral chenin blanc goes best with saag-palak, while the tandoori preparations need full-bodied reds with oak aging. there is also a chapter on indian wines ('the desi shelf'), a field which, though still a “toddler” is apparently now starting to spread wings with french (who else!) help, away from the traditional popular sparkling wines into a wider range: cabernets and sauvignon blancs, and where the dindori reserve shiraz from the sula vineyards actually receives a high rating from singh. view the page star health

struggling with strategic fallouts of 2/25
bdr mutiny (or 2/25) created strategic implications of unimaginable consequences both within and without the country. friends and enemies, far and near, are watching our actions and utterances and devising their own strategies to keep the fallout of 2/25 from reaching their own doorsteps. 2/25 has caused multidirectional alarms in regional and concerned capitals. our government and opposition are further complicating the matter by trying to answer the unanswerable “hypothetically”, thus creating insurmountable confusions, which compels all seeking answers to go astray and haywire.

study of a perplexing regional organization
saarc, a manifestation of regionalism, emerged in an institutional form on 8 december 1985 as another effort at attaining regional cooperation, this time in south asia. in shah muhammad ikhtiar jahan kabir's view, “saarc has been contributing to the regionalism in south asia as an institution, as a process and a spirit.” however, further down the book, the author declares: “the saarc charter remains a non-starter from the very beginning to guide the regional process.” the contradiction in the two observations should not escape the reader, and there are several in regionalism in south asia: a critique of the functionalist approach. they mar the quality of a serious undertaking, which purports “to address the question of whether the ongoing process of cooperation in south asia is on the right track; and if it is not, then to explore alternatives or remedies.”

most of our adult life is spent working. taking into account commuting time, overtime, thinking about our jobs and worrying over work, we spend increasingly more of our waking hours in the office, on the road, behind the desk than we do at home. this is a reality shared by countless workers. how many of us can put on a genuine smile and say, “i love my work and all that comes in the package”?
