rising prices, approaching ramadan
there is an anxiety among the general public about a further rise in the prices of essential items during ramadan. every new season of significance, be it ramadan or eid, has seen prices inflate to levels that leave the poor absolutely helpless and the middle classes struggling, often in vain, to maintain a decent living. if some recent statistics from the bangladesh bureau of statistics are any guide, the inflation rate on food items for the month of july this year registered a worrying 13 percent. it thus becomes easy to see which way things will likely go in the coming days, unless of course, import is timely, transportation of commodities, now impaired by floods is steadied with special efforts and supply and distribution mechanisms are rendered efficient.

pakistan, or how a dictator humiliates a country

plight of our workers
we are observing the plight of our workers stranded in malaysian airports. when these people boarded the flight to malaysia, they dreamt of working hard and sending their hard-earned money home. mostly, they envisaged a better life. however, upon descending, they were not received by any members of their recruiting agency. despite having legal documents, they were then taken to a warehouse where the authorities stopped supplying food after two days. these people are now staring at their bleak future.
drockstars
it seems rock & roll has scaled great heights in dhaka city in recent years. popular "modern" bands like artcell, black, cryptic fate, arbovirus, nemesis etc have made their mark in the music industry. but most recently, the final six bands of drockstars --bortoman, dour, radioactive, eclipse, power surge, dreek have also gained considerable popularity in the music industry. four months of intense competition, heartbreak and simply mind-blowing performances have finally paid off but now the competition has ended. bands like power surge, the ultimate winner, who have delivered splendid performances (portraying their metal core and thrash metal influence), radioactive, who are most popular amongst the judges as they concentrate on their old school rock & roll and hard rock ballad's influence, and the other bands-- dreek, dour and bortoman also gained considerable respect.
shoaib akhtar
the cricketer who always seems to unnecessarily get himself into trouble is no one but shoaib akhtar. the "rawalpindi express", who has a habit of getting himself involved in controversies, recently invited fresh trouble for him by hitting asif with a bat. this puerile behaviour, has now left him out of the twenty20 world cup as the pcb has dropped him from the tournament. it appears that shoaib is destined to miss all the major tournaments because, if my memory serves me right, he, along with asif, even missed this year's world cup although the ban imposed on them had been lifted. more recently, he was also on a six-week probation. so, these sorts of incidents are nothing unusual for the world's fastest bowler.
a fresh beginning
i left bangladesh with a scholarship in 1974. august 15, 1975 broke our hearts as we lost bangabandhu. later, flood, cyclone, hunger, internal disorder, killing of the great freedom fighters like, taher, zia, monzur etc. saddened us all. then came the years of corruption. we felt very humiliated to have our origin in bangladesh. not once, i faced the question, why should sweden have research and teachers exchange programme with the most corrupt country in the world? why business in bangladesh, asked many.
justice
our politicians think that we are, well, to put it bluntly, stupid. just before her remand, begum khaleda zia said that neither she nor her 'sons have any craving for money' because they have 'been bestowed with the love of the people'. well i say, if it looks like sleaze, if it smells like sleaze, then in all probability, it is sleaze!
university teachers
a university, we all know, is the highest seat of learning and a sanctuary for resolving problems. university teachers' job is to teach students and to help solve crisis with patience and make the country a safer place to live in. however, it is fairly appalling to observe the role of a handful of university teachers in making the country an inferno.
presidency
the post of president in our prime minister's( i don't say parliamentary or cabinet) form of government is nothing better than a dignified hibernation. one deposed president once lamented that orders passed in his name were hardly shown to him.
stranded pakistanis
the proposed citizenship for the stranded pakistani refugees is a completely wrong decision by the government. the decision makers either have no understanding of history, or this decision is a part of the systemic effort to delink people (especially the younger generation) from the glorious freedom movement's heritage and history. no doubt an 'eid news' for pakistan. thousands of freedom fighters are still alive and this news will make their hearts bleed.
the two leaders
it appears that khaleda zia does not have the intellectual capacity to understand why she is in jail. autocratic practices and "paribartantra" or "dynastic politics" within our dysfunctional democracy have pushed the nation to where we are today. by unilaterally expelling mannan bhuiyan, she has demonstrated her immaturity and total disdain for democracy within her party. i find her "let them eat cake" mentality comically amusing - god save the queen! (because no one else will).
can we afford two airports?
after the commissioning of zia international airport by the late president ziaur rahman, news surfaced in those days that the old tejgaon airport would be demolished and the vast area would be utilised for the purpose of residential and government office buildings.
smoking
it is clear that smoking amounts to slow poisoning. in our modern society, many people smoke. our new generation smokes as a fashion or style without knowing its bad effects. it is fatal as well as costly. there is no doubt that smoking is a great health hazard. one puff of cigarette contains nicotine, tar, methyl alcohol, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, arsenic, banzopyrene and several other substances which are injurious to health. it causes cancer, heart disease, bronchitis, asthma, gastric ulcer, tb, loss of appetite, decay of teeth and diseases of lung. nicotine is so dangerous that if the quantity of nicotine contained in two cigarette sticks is injected into a healthy man, it will cause death. it also harms the nerves. according to the specialists, one burning cigarette gives off more than four thousand harmful elements. cigarette not only harms the smokers but also pollutes the environment. nonsmokers inhale the poisonous smoke, one should not smoke before children because the poisonous smoke harms the children a great deal. he who drinks poison suffers himself but smoking is dangerous both for the active smokers and the passive ones. it can be said that smoking is committing suicide.
our police
it is exciting news that our police can prove that they are not an incapable lot. the police are capable of performing much better. recently, they arrested seven young criminals who had killed an innocent boy for five thousand taka and a mobile set.
bridge on the river panj
on august 26 afghan and tajik leaders, mediated by the usa, have inaugurated a new bridge linking their countries across river panj at pyandzh. the $37m project, a us gift, replaces an intermittent ferry service across the fast-flowing river. the bridge - nearly 700m (yards) long and 11m across - has replaced an unreliable ferry which was the only way of getting across the river panj.
restriction on motorbike import
after being born and brought up in the middle east, i decided to move back to bangladesh and live here. what i didn't realise is that import regulations and weird laws are prevailing in our country. i have been trying to import a motorcycle which is a hobby and passion of mine but all efforts have gone in vain. trying to find answers, i have found that the government has imposed this very "weird" regulation against motorcycles because police & rab officials have said and i quote, “if high powered motorcycles are allowed, we will not be able to chase them and catch them.” this is just a laughable and ridiculous excuse. and therefore it was decided through a government sro that the import of any motorcycles above 125cc would be restricted. i would like to bring to the government's notice that neighbouring india does not have this law. don't you think it is an absurd excuse given here? the general opinion of people in bangladesh is that motorcycles are driven by hooligans and mastans. what about the rest of us, who are motorcycle enthusiasts and we ride because we enjoy riding and take it as a hobby. as a result of such laws, there is no development of any recreation or motor-sports activities in our country. we should look at countries like india & malaysia who are hosts to world class events such as the moto-gp and other motor sporting events which bring huge amounts of earnings for their respective governments. if the import of a hummer or a porsche carrera can be allowed, then why can’t i import a 600cc honda cbr?

making democracy work: defining the parliamentary constituencies
