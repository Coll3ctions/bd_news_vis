israel's nuclear ambiguity: time to come out of the closet

elections in myanmar

rediscovering nature's resplendence
everyone should go back to nature every once in a while. for sourav mahmud, though, nature is part of the everyday pattern of life. which is why he moves from one spot in the country to another, to rediscover all those dimensions of nature that have consistently enriched bangladesh's environment. mahmud is young. the brutal frankness these days is that you do not expect much of the enterprising from the young, for reasons that have to do with urbanisation, indeed that have to do with the relative ease that has come into the conduct of life through means of technology.
a tortuous struggle in defence of dignity
one hears the story of an enchanting land comprising people who are a world unto themselves in terms of ways of living their lives, their demeanour, emotional outbursts, moral standards set by themselves, however wide the deviations might be from the edicts of religion entailing double standards and many others. a reader keeps on peeling off layer after layer of darkness only to discover a nadir of darkness sown in their character as reflected particularly in their private lives unknown to the world outside. one common factor that binds all such people in all such families is that they are all 'obscenely rich'; their men are free to do as they like while women as lesser beings are ruled by them and are the arbiters of their fate. there is dissatisfaction, resentment, fear and sorrow among the womenfolk but all in a hush-hush way. then the reader is startled coming face to face with a rebel, a belligerent young woman who is determined to fight tooth and nail for her freedom as a human being, knowing full well the price she will have to pay for it. in other words, amira, the protagonist, later known as jenna sorrel in america, risks her life along with her baby son to win freedom.
understanding the american ethos
"impatience with theories, ideas --- the entire practice and process of abstract thought --- is perhaps the most common manifestation of anti-intellectualism throughout american popular culture and average americans' day-to-day lives. therefore, it should be no surprise when that attitude is found even in magazine coverage of higher education --- the one institution in which americans have expected (not to say preferred) and perhaps even tolerated this core requirement of intellectual activity.” although these lines are to be found towards the end of an absorbing book, in a chapter (6) pertinently titled “unreflective instrumentalism, hedonism, sexism, and age discrimination”, they encapsulate the general drift of anti-intellectualism in american media: magazines & higher education. and the author, while ending the previous chapter (5), entitled “populist anti-elitism and higher education”, bemoans such a state of affairs thus: “however, the needs and opportunities in the united states in the areas of arts, sciences, government, journalism, retail politics, and the overall american culture and american society --- even the complexity of day-to-day life for the average citizen --- suggest that more citizens, not fewer, should be learning, and not only a finite amount for a degree, but learning more and more over a longer period of time. unfortunately, american anti-intellectualism makes the idea of even necessary, let alone optional, lifelong learning a tough sell.”
of reputations proper and misplaced
swedish linguist sven ohman (1936-2008) knew differently, and it would be even harder to imagine why he believed that noam chomsky (b. 1928--) has never been a linguist. it is something hard to believe for anyone who is familiar with the name of chomsky and the reputation it carries. formerly an uppsala university professor of linguistics, sven ohman in his book, the essence of language: a philosophical problem, has successfully established his observations and findings denying chomsky's position as a linguist.
