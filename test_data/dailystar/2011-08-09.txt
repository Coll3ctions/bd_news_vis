throwing to the 'wolf' in noakhali
the news, and that too, belated, of cops letting a mob in noakhali beat a 16-year-old boy to death, is shocking. not only has the worrying trend of mob violence become a common occurrence in recent days, but in this particular case, the role of the police has made it even more alarming. according to witnesses, the law enforcers actually verbally encouraged the mob to kill the boy. if he was in fact a robber -- as police have claimed but which locals have said is unlikely -- then it was the job of the police to arrest him, not let the mob beat him to death, thereby taking the law into their own hands.

belief, scepticism and the brain
beliefs come first, reasons follow. a common question from skeptics and science-based thinkers ask, “how could anyone believe that?” sometimes people do believe false and even weird things. in fact, the brain is a belief engine. it finds meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaningless data. once beliefs are formed, we seek out confirmatory arguments and evidence to justify them ignoring the contrary evidence. indeed, we do not like to admit that we are wrong.

earth's “trojan” asteroid
recently, nasa's wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise), mission has detected orbiting the sun in loops around the plane of earth's orbit. before getting into details, let's explain what trojan is in the realms of astronomy. a trojan is a minor planet or natural satellite (moon) that shares an orbit with a larger planet or moon, but does not collide with it because it constantly lead or follow in the same orbit as the planet. prior to this latest discovery, it was known that within our own solar systems, saturn has the most known trojan satellites: saturn's moon tethys has two trojan moons (telesto and calypso), and dione also has two trojan moons (helene and polydeuces). in the scientific community, it was a long-held belief that earth should have trojans however their discovery was a sternly challenging one since they are relatively small and appear close to the sun from earth's point of view. according to martin connors of athabasca university, canada, who is also the lead author of the paper on this discovery that appeared in the july 28th issue of the journal nature, “these asteroids dwell mostly in the daylight, making them very hard to see. but we finally found one, because the object has an unusual orbit that takes it farther away from the sun than what is typical for trojans. wise was a game-changer, giving us a point of view difficult to have at earth's surface”.

what is artificial gravity?
artificial gravity is the varying of gravity using artificial means. it is used largely in space, but also on earth. it can be achieved by the use of different forces, in particular centrifugal force and (for short periods) linear acceleration. the creation of artificial gravity is considered desirable for long-term space travel or habitation. it allows for ease of mobility, and helps to avoid the adverse health effects of weightlessness in the absence of gravity.
