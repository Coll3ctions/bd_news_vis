that was no cricket!
to win a game is always exciting. to lose it is again to be expected, for that is the rule with games, indeed with life itself. but when the bangladesh cricket team put itself and the rest of the nation through misery on friday, it was not winning or losing we were concerned with. it was something more. it was simple awareness of how much lower a team playing cricket on a global scale could go. to be washed out for a miserable fifty eight runs is deep embarrassment. on friday, it was a whole country rendered immobile by images of bangladesh's batsmen stepping on to the pitch and stepping off it in quick progression. it was not just bad cricket. it was no cricket at all. view the page sports

caught napping....
....because i was napping. well, fact and figuratively a bit more than a nap because i missed the whole match. let me explain, if you are in the mood for it. having got back from moses where a whole lot of issues were addressed and many of the world's problems were solved, although those were a different set of stories, i had settled down comfortably for the afternoon matinee, namely wi v ban. as an armchair critic my comfort levels are important to me. so like a reclining buddha i was comfortably, and as it turned out though, a bit too comfortably, not too relaxed mind you at that point, in a state of considered preparedness for the bangladesh innings. just in time though to catch kayes being caught low down in front by the keeper. ignore the unintended pun, please. tamim i had missed altogether because i was a little late on the draw with the remote, but he was not, as was quite apparent i later learnt, courtesy of several uncomplimentary slowmos. and then, total black out.

weekly currency roundup
feb 27- march 3, 2011
international markets:
the usd hovered near 4-month lows against a basket of currencies this week. the euro hovered near a four-month high and a key resistance area against the dollar on thursday, supported by expectations a european central bank meeting will pave the way for rate rises later in the year. investors have pushed the euro up about 3 percent from a low hit on feb. 14 in anticipation that ecb chief jean-claude trichet will sharpen the central bank's anti-inflation rhetoric as oil prices continue to soar. some market players think the bank will switch three-month liquidity operations back to capped-limit, variable rate tenders a mainly symbolic step in the phasing out of crisis support that could also help clear the way for a rate hike. some traders said there is a risk the euro could slip after the ecb meeting since many market players are already counting on the central bank to send strong signals that it will raise rates to counter inflation. data showed last week that speculators' long positions in the euro have soared to their highest level since mid-october, pointing to the risk of profit-taking. but market players also said the currency's outlook in the longer term hinges on where oil prices are going, as the dollar comes under pressure from rising oil prices. many investors believe that higher oil prices will push central banks to raise interest rates to combat inflation but that the federal reserve is likely to lag the ecb and others, maintaining broadly simulative policy to support growth. the us currency also hit a one-month low of 81.57 yen on wednesday, though thick bids around 81.50 yen, were likely to limit further losses in the near-term. view the page metropolitan

we miss the 'narail express'
after losing to india the whole nation was upset. even if the batting was good we could not reach the target. it all happened only because the bowlers did not give their best. how could the indians score 370? it only happened because mashrafe was not there! he has the heart of a real tiger. this all-rounder had a great contribution in beating india last time and was also the man of the match then. the whole nation, especially our captain will now miss the bowling of mashrafe. injured mashrafe could play better than the other bowlers. we miss the 'narail express'!

how do we express shame?
currently, i along with my only son have been visiting bangladesh. we have no words to express our sense of shame at what happened in the country during the last two weeks. that politicians can stoop so low as to indulge in a free and uninhibited use of obscene language and extremely objectionable gestures is something no one in any country can imagine. the nation expects a lot from them. millions of people elected them and they cannot accept the behaviours some lawmakers displayed and the language they used beginning from arial beel issue to icc world cup, stock market scam to countrywide strike and many more. public sentiment is everything. with public sentiment nothing can fail; without it nothing can succeed. it is true that you may fool all the people for some time, you can even fool some people all the time; but you can't fool all the people all the time.

shafiqur and the government!

a nation with short memory
we always need bumps to recall things, to see things. we are such a nation! we need a market to crash before getting to know that the market is dangerously overheated. we need people to be dead squeezed between buses, stamped under wheels to see those reckless drivers driving city buses. we need kids to be hit in the head and paralyzed by bricks falling from under-construction buildings to see that the constructors are not taking precautionary steps to prevent accidents! however, we do not need anything to forget all these in no time! we were shocked to see our government's bizarre attempt to grab huge area of cultivable lands, evict inhabitants from their homes to build “airport” when we are facing food scarcity. in cox's bazar, those speedboats are dangerously being driven in the shore packed with hundreds of bathing tourists. any day we would hear somebody is injured or dead having been hit by one of those boats. then again, we will take steps to repel them off the shore, not before that. after a while they will come back again.
ban fatwa
