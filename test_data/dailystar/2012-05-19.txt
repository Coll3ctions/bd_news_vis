asia as global leader - not so fast

economic diplomacy between bangladesh and east asia
the role of economic diplomacy has been transformed in the post cold war era. trade, market and investment have been promoted through using foreign policy instruments. now a day, there is a growing realisation that economic relationships have strong impacts on political relationships and these will not be effective until or unless a robust economic diplomacy is pursued by the stake holders. against this backdrop, bangladesh foreign policy also has to count on economic diplomacy to have increased access to global markets. notwithstanding the commitment of the bangladesh government to use economic diplomacy as the central strategy to all the diplomatic initiative (budget speech, 2009-10, section 261) the performance of bangladesh in this sector is not so satisfactory. an enhanced economic diplomacy should be pursued to attract investment, utilize and obtain technology along with better management of external economic assistance.

revisiting the lost alleys
hasnat abdul hye needs no introduction to the literary world of bangladesh. his is a household name that has kept readers spellbound for nearly four decades. his versatility in every genre of literature is remarkable, perhaps with the only exception of poetry that very interestingly and speaking figuratively has been compensated for by the way he used to be addressed by the then finance minister saifur rahman as 'kobi', meaning a poet. this bit of information comes from a tv interview of the author. all those yesterdays is an autobiographical account of the writer's youth that straddles eleven years of the prime of his life. unusually long narratives, crowds of people, a plethora of events and places all characterise the subject matter of the book to make it a full-fledged real-life story of the author. minute details that are dealt with meticulously give evidence to the authenticity of facts along with the author's acute power of observation --- the eye of a seasoned anthropologist where nothing goes amiss. since hye has produced the stories mostly from his memory rather than taking help from the usual entries in a regularly kept diary -- a practice that he did only for a short duration while in america --- they tell readers about his amazing ability to record things in his memory to be produced vividly much later.
where the world comes to die . . .
it is of course as a fiction writer that chetan bhagat has gained this immense popularity. he decided to quit his job as an investment banker to follow his passion, writing, which to him was more important than monetary or professional success. in may 2010 he was enlisted in time magazine's list of 100 most influential people. in the same year malalai joya was also enlisted. she was a fierce critic of the nato war in afghanistan. she was admonished for her views by ayaan hirsi ali, who was enlisted in the 2005 list of influential persons.
