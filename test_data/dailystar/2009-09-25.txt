holidays and healthcare deficit
the saddest thing that could happen to people is for them to be deprived of public services every time a holiday season comes round. it is a reality which has always been felt keenly during the period around and on eid. as a report in this newspaper makes clear, innumerable citizens (and they are almost all in the lower income category) suffered during the festival holidays because of an acute absence of doctors and other medical personnel in the hospitals. given that public services are always a twenty-four hour job, arrangements should have been in place to handle patients during the holidays. is there any mechanism to ensure this?

rivers
the rivers of bangladesh basically mark both the physiography of the nation and the life of the people. nearly 700 in number, these rivers generally flow south. the larger rivers serve as the main source of water for cultivation and as the principal arteries of commercial transportation. rivers also provide fish, an important source of protein. flooding of the rivers during the monsoon season causes enormous hardship and hinders development, but fresh deposits of rich silt replenish the fertile but overworked soil. the rivers also drain excess monsoon rainfall into the bay of bengal. thus, the great river system is at the same time the country's principal resource and its greatest hazard.

nijhum dwip deer
my previous letter on the subject was a knee-jerk and totally sentimental reaction on the proliferation of the nijhum deer, given my lifelong concern for our forests and wildlife. dr reza khan has done an admirable job (ds 12 sept) in putting the issue in its correct perspective given the present conditions, while mine were at least 40-50 years old. actually i was influenced by a recent documentary in the national geographic which depicted a south african couple who reared a pair of tiger cubs on their sprawling farm, cared for them, trained them to hunt and within 2-3 years gradually released them into the wild. five years later they were flourishing with a family. imagine wild bengal tigers in africa, when this magnificent creature faces decimation in its own homeland!!!
the city we had
the difference between the two is heaven and earth. about 80% of the city dwellers do not have any idea about the provincial capital dacca. months ago i came back to dhaka from houston, texas. it is said that sugarland is heaven on earth. i do not think it will be out of place to mention sugarland is what dacca used to be 40 years ago. dhaka has gone back many years behind dacca. the decline began 40 years ago and is still on.

commerce minister and tcb
soon after taking over as commerce minister, faruk khan issued confusing statements about the role of tcb. he said tcb would have no role in the market and after a few days he stated that it would have a role! probably, he intended to appease the businessmen with this statement. it is now apparent that this did not work since the price of sugar is now tk 70 per kg!
law secretary

deed writers
the hand writing of the quack deed writers was a problem for the people in the past. the quacks don't have enough knowledge of land laws. also, they do not know the latest rules and regulations of land registration system, but they have established their supremacy in the land registration office.
diplomats and traffic
mr. elahi's (ds 16th september, 2009) point - that no one but the tax payer of a foreign diplomat stationed anywhere has a right to question how the former spend the latter's money - is moot given that i never raised it. my concern is about the use of suvs by international agencies and abuse of traffic laws and disruption of flow by diplomatic vehicles by blocking busy roads and travelling in an armed convoy as though they were very important state officials of the country. while the diplomats may not be the root cause of the traffic problem, by their apparent misbehaviour, isn't it obvious that they are not helping?
taxpayers harassed twice
income tax & value added tax (vat) of a business is assessed on the basis of sale or turnover. this is unbelievable but believe it that in bangladesh the sale or turnover of a business is always assessed twice by two different govt. departments & the sale or turnover figure assessed by the two departments for the same business is always different! this funny thing is happening because income tax & vat are assessed by income tax & customs department respectively and there is no co-ordination between the two departments. as a result, a businessman is harassed twice for the same business, which is completely unnecessary.
the baul's passing
your second editorial entitled "the baul's passing" published on 14 september seemed to contain certain factual mistakes. you wrote "education, a difficult proposition for him considering his state of penury, stopped when he was informed by the school authorities that pupils were expected to serve in the first world war. one looking for peace of the soul could not indulge in the horror of war. karim never went back to school." karim, the baul samrat, was born in 1916, during the first world war (1914-1918). he was two years old when the wwi ended. as such a suckling baby of his age was not expected to enrol in the school!
