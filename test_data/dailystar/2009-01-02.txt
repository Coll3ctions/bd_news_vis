sheikh hasina's positive comments
we are heartened by the content and tenor of awami league chief sheikh hasina's comments at her post-election press briefing on wednesday. she has sounded some specific positive signals. the victorious al leader has offered the position of deputy speaker of the jatiyo sangsad and the chairmanship of some parliamentary standing committees to the opposition. while these are certainly signs of a fresh new beginning toward making parliament functional, sheikh hasina could go a step better by proposing that the speaker of the js, once he or she is chosen, should resign from the political party he or she belongs to as a first, significant sign of the neutrality demanded of such a key position. indeed, the idea was part of the bangladesh nationalist party manifesto and if it is accepted by the awami league, it will serve as a good signal to the opposition about the sincerity of the ruling party. elevating the position of the leader of the opposition right after that of the leader of the house will be another positive gesture to the opposition.

destroying your brand
what is a brand? you will get several verbose definitions, depending on the book you look up. to me, a brand means just one thing- trust. all activities done by an organisation will build up brand image, which translates to trust. every time a customer interacts with anything related to an organisation, be it people, products or advertisements, it will create an emotional experience. and be careful, this experience will eventually translate into trust, whether the customer will trust spending their money by buying from you.

the spirit of bangladesh
congratulations to all bangladeshis for successfully holding one of the most fair and peaceful elections in south asia. people have spoken loud and clear by choosing the awami league alliance to serve the country. this is as much a victory of the peaceful execution of democracy, as it is of sheikh hasina whose alliance party won a landslide. even though there are no fresh faces at the top, there are new visionary leaders who have won seats in the parliament. there are also many who have worked behind the scenes in the past two years to help their parties re-organise. it was a crushing defeat to all who were counting on violence and disarray. the bangladesh army and the election commission have shown much discipline and far-sightedness by deploying a high-tech voter registration system which was pivotal to the election success in 2008 and beyond. we are grateful to them.

architecture of the air
light and sound shows involving architectural structures are increasingly becoming popular in the modern urban aesthetics. in bangladesh however, this idea is quite new, due to so many reasons. a weeklong light and sound show on the newly constructed bridge over gulshan lake, linking banani and gulshan residential areas, was an opportunity for dhakaiites to witness this idea. view the page op-ed
time for politicians to prove a point
december 29, 2008 was the calmest day of the year. from the morning, people were moving to the poll stations peacefully, transports were significantly less than the average day of dhaka. even on eid, there is much more hustle and bustle in the streets than what we saw on the election day.
daring to dream
two miracles happened in bangladesh a few days ago. first, over eighty percent of bangladeshis voted in one of the most peaceful elections in its history. secondly, bangladesh, the second largest muslim majority country in the world, voted for a party that believes in secularism by giving it eighty-five percent of the parliament seats.
what happens next?
when the first blast sounded, on saturday at just past 11 a.m., i hardly took notice. i was at work in my office on the second floor of the palestine tower in gaza city, where i write for the local newspaper. large explosions had been increasingly rare since hamas and israel struck their ceasefire pact six months ago. still, i decided to stay put and keep writing. by the time the second bomb landed, moments later, i knew something serious was happening. the whole office broke into a panic. i ran as fast as i could, shouting to my colleagues to leave the building.
a gentle reminder
december 29, 2008 was a strange day. for me -- a first time voter -- it was like playing chess and making the right decision. should it be the refreshingly novice advocate? should the nation finally forgive the repentant general? whether the disastrous dynasty should be given a second chance? or should i just cast "no to all above" and vote them to oblivion? it was a day of dilemma and a day to decide. view the page startech
