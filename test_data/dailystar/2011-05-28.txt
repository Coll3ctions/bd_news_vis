sweeping condemnation of rab
bangladeshis could perhaps be forgiven for being verbose and rhetorical and at times pompous in their behaviour and mode of expressions, for bangla has been viewed as a language of over-statement. it is thus no wonder that the bengali speaking people are sensitive and sentimental in social transactions. however, when a supposedly phlegmatic and responsible gentleman of the western world who speaks in english, understandably a language of understatement, indulges in hyperbole, it causes uneasiness.

hamlet and ophelia in dhaka
how do you celebrate the birthday of the greatest dramatist and playwright, william shakespeare, that is? joining up with a bard birthday bash at stratford-upon-avon would be the best way to celebrate it. since that is possible for only a few, others may choose to enjoy a play or read a sonnet or a long poem to get into the spirit.

in search of bluebird
the genesis of love remains a mystery. they say how, why, and when it happens no one knows. on the art and science of love ontor solemnly declares it is an innocence bordering on naïve faith. surely it is the half cognizant absences in life that lure leanings towards the other; no more, no less. one is compelled, fascinated, attracted by different aspects of more than one individual. sometimes it is a sense of intellectual compatibility, sometimes of a verve that one notices which denotes the promise of excitement and stimulation! such sparks cannot be love. can it? mentally she makes a note: it is good to remember that in the end we have only ourselves. the phone rings, putting an end to her cascade of contemplations. she is reluctant to converse with neel. who would say anything yet? recently her fragmented thoughts could not find their way on paper. she hears herself say:
as we walk the path
sleep dearly, my love,
paint your thoughts in hues of
wild laughter, warm embrace,
passion and promises shared.

dying in the dark: critical care in a bad shape
critical care or intensive care medicine can be the difference between life and death for patients with critical illnesses. critical care services, usually provided in the intensive care unit (icu) are scarce, expensive, unequally distributed in bangladesh. in many instances, it is substandard and runs as a profitable business. urgent action is needed to reform critical care services in order to save people who are dying in the dark.
reduce your risk of developing diabetes
the number of people living with diabetes is growing very fast. in bangladesh, more 8 percent people are diabetic and a significant number has been suffering from catastrophic complications of diabetes like visual impairment, amputation, kidney failure, heart attack, stroke etc. preventing or delaying the development of diabetes can be the best strategy reducing the burden of the disease — both physically and economically. changing our lifestyle could be a big step toward diabetes prevention.

does russia fit into bangladesh's geopolitical matrix?
pragmatically, we are done with “friendship-to-all-malice-to-none” period. now, it is the geopolitical compulsion that leads to the reckoning of how to employ geo-strategic advantages to build a sustainable security design for the future ahead. the question forges to the front when we face a dilemma in making decisions on any of the offers made by the big powers to contribute for our sake. again very recently, it has become an issue when an agreement with gazprom, the state-owned energy-exploration company of russia for cooperation and assistance in the area of gas exploration in bangladesh has been ratified by the two countries. however, the question of a steady bangladesh-russia relations was brought into the spotlight when the present government reached a five-year nuclear deal with russia seeking assistance in the field of the peaceful use of nuclear energy, particularly building a 1,000-megawatt nuclear power plant to help supply of the increasing energy demands of bangladesh. the plant was projected to cost up to $2 billion to be able to generate electricity by 2014. under the agreement, russia would assist to design, construct and operate nuclear power plants and to train bangladeshi engineers and officials.
the nuclear debate at a dead end
the 25th anniversary of the chernobyl disaster and current concerns about the consequences of the nuclear accident in fukushima act as a cruel reminder that nuclear energy like any other industrial activity presents an irreducible risk for the environment and human health. yet, the full impact of nuclear accidents on the environment and public health remains unknown. despite crucial differences in terms of accident causes, radioactivity releases and local demographics, japan's emergency evacuation plans in fukushima are virtually identical to the contingency plans set by ukrainian authorities in 1986. beyond the technical and scientific challenges faced by public health surveys, this situation is favoured by two decades of debate about the pros and cons of nuclear energy, where both sides have been presenting misleading data to support their respective agendas.

the tears and pride of a mother
a mother is desperately looking for her only son through every lead she can get for days after he was seized by the pakistani military for interrogation about the whereabouts of freedom fighters of the independence war. finally she meets her son behind bars at the prison cell. the son has been so brutally tortured that he can barely stand or talk. he tells his mother that the military will release him if he reveals the names of the others who are in control of guerrilla groups. the devastated but brave and indomitable mother tells him, “keep strong son, don't tell anyone's name”. this is a mother as strong as the now sovereign country of ours. she would not bend before the fear of losing a precious possession for the greater good, for upholding the rights of citizens, for the liberty of bangladesh.
of fairy tales, of lives really lived
bollywood is a strange, quixotic place. first, you wonder why that term 'bollywood' has come to be attached to the world's largest movie industry. couldn't someone have devised a better term rather than aping hollywood? that aping has led to such puerility as lollywood (to describe the pakistani movie industry in lahore) and dhaliwood, here in bangladesh. then comes the fairy tale aspect of the indian film industry. it still tends to operate in a world of unreal songs, fantasy dances and love stories that always end up with the man and the woman ready to live happily ever after. realism is something you are yet to get out of bollywood.
a writer, through a different lens
depicting a part of any great man's life cannot be limited within the man. the depiction also extracts something out of the time and society in which the man has spent his life. in fact, when we go through any biography or autobiography, it is the times and life of contemporary society that on the whole attract us. going through dhakar buddhadeb basu is no exception. it is rather more interesting. though not comprehensive, it is an exciting illustration of the times, the people and the society of contemporary dhaka which influenced buddhadeb basu in his early life.
