natore court action against policemen
a court in natore has issued warrants of arrest against twelve policemen and seven other people on the charge of murdering a young man through so-called crossfire in august 2009. the move is significant considering the manner in which the youth was killed and the way in which his death was passed off as a matter of routine law and order. it brings to the fore once again the critical issue of 'crossfires' which have aroused, naturally, public fury at home and outrage abroad. sadly enough, these 'crossfires', which first became regular practice on the part of the security forces, have continued even under the present elected awami league-led government. what is infinitely of grave concern is the fact that despite their pre-election position against 'crossfires', the leading lights of the government (and that includes the home minister) have instead tried defending such questionable acts as part of law enforcement measures. view the page sports

our lovely country
recently, i watched a bbc programme called 'tropic of cancer'. as a part of this programme mr simon reeve embarks on an epic journey around the world following the tropic of cancer and uncovers environmental, political and human stories from some of the most remote places on the planet. in bangladesh, simon sails down the mighty padma and visits fishermen who use trained otters to drive fish into their nets. further on, he sees the riverbanks crumbling before his eyes. increased river erosion is thought to be caused by global climate change. and in the capital dhaka he meets some of the millions of child workers.

save buriganga
we have already noticed the river buriganga has been polluted at an alarming rate that resulted in the dreadful condition of surface water. the ecological system has been imbalanced by different kinds of man-made activities such as unplanned urbanisation on the banks of the river. many industries and factories have been set up on the banks without showing any regard for environmental issues.
is it a fair deal?
we have learned that petrobangla and ministry of power, energy & mineral resources have recently allocated 1,00000 (one lakh) mt of condensate for two private companies.
aluminium windows
nowadays almost all the houses of dhaka city have thai aluminium windows which can be opened and closed easily. however, only fifty percent of the windows can be opened. in this way we are depriving ourselves of air. i think in a city where population density is so high and where load shedding is so frequent, use of such kind of window is not a good idea. moreover, the distance between the houses is very little, thus this window makes things worse.
the ci and govt.
the story of a sinking ship is unfolding slowly. the ci can defend his contention politically, but his chances of gaining the status of the chief investigator as per charter of the act was remote and literally impossible. he was behaving like a typical government servant.
flagging education
with the new academic year beginning, parents, particularly those belonging to the middle and lower middle classes, are a harassed lot. in the past, schools were run by governments and the quality of education was good. teachers were dedicated and there was no need for private tuition. but now private schools and coaching centres are mushrooming all over the country. we find them giving huge advertisements on their pass percentage and successful candidates. accordingly, they also demand huge fees. another growing trend is publicity in schools that they coach students for entrance examinations right from the fifth standard. of course, they charge a premium.

magic of belief
why is it that some people always succeed in whatever they do and others continue to fail? how come some people drift through life trying to find the energy to go on, and others have abounding energy? is there some magic potion that the successful have access to? the answer is yes. the magic potion is belief. the idea of the magic of believing is born out of the fact that masterpieces, world architecture, societies and cultures, discoveries, new skills, world records... man's achievements have all resulted from the quaint beginnings of a simple belief. what magnificent and incredible power, and apparent magic, stems from a clear cut belief!
energy options
i'm writing in response to the cover-page articles in the latest issue of the daily star (30th april 2010) on energy options for us. the lead article 'the case for coal' explored, and, to a great extent, as i understand, suggested coal option to ensure our energy security, and the next article advocated for solar breakthrough. well, the first thing first. the real solutions to the energy and climate crisis is well-addressed by it, and what the writer told are available today if we focus on what we have in abundance.
ci resigns
with the voluntary resignation of mr. abdul matin, the chief of the war crimes investigation agency, what has the government taken as a lesson/learnt? this type of incident is embarrassing both for the government and the individual concerned. is there any guarantee that the next person selected will also be a correct choice? therefore to avoid such incidents in future the government may formulate appropriate procedures.
black money
black money generally means what is earned through illegal means. but, legally earned money would be black money if the earner does not pay tax on it.
tax issue
recently, the issue of taxing the share traded income and mandatory tin for bo account created panic amongst the share investors. but it is also necessary that the government earns from such a huge transacting market. i think that the easiest way could be to impose a 0.1%(zero point one percent) mandatory fees on all the amount transacted, which could easily bring tk. 1 crore income to the government on the 1,000 crore transacted daily. this could be a hassle free way for both. there are many other benefits in taxing this way.
