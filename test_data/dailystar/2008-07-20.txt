the killing of the bdr men
the killing of two bdr men by india's border security force the other day is an act that cannot but cause deep concern in dhaka. coming at a time when there are noticeable changes for the better in relations between the two countries and especially when the foreign secretaries of the two countries have been meeting in delhi, the shooting by the bsf has laid open to question the modus operandi on which it operates at the border. indeed, in the past too there have been reports of indiscriminate firing by the bsf on people in bangladesh territory and especially of bdr personnel.
anti-dumping issue
we are concerned at the news of huge quantities of foreign goods being regularly dumped in the country by overseas manufacturers. a report in the business page of this daily gave details of how despite the existing international law prohibiting export of goods at a lower price than the price in the domestic market, many countries are flouting the law, especially when exporting goods to bangladesh. and because of this practice, one can easily see how shops in every corner are overflowing with imported consumers goods, mostly cheap and substandard as far as price and quality are concerned. this no doubt is forcing the local manufacturers to face uneven competition and financial loss at the end of the day. but world trade organisation (wto) clearly states that export of a product may be termed dumping if the exporting company sells it at a price lower than the price it normally charges in the domestic market. bangladesh has officially adopted the anti-dumping rule in 1995 following an agreement at the wto but so far it has not been able to reap any benefit from it.
remittance and resilience in rural areas
the seven billion dollar remittance flow into bangladesh should be seen as a sigh of relief when the economy is caught in a catalogue of economic crises. this amount is roughly 12% of our gdp. analysts say that our workers from foreign countries sent more money this year to help families faced with price hike. for us particularly, right at the moment, the sauce matters -- not the source. however, foreign exchange flows are not an unmixed blessing, as they might fuel money supply to further inflationary spiral unless properly "sterilized" by the central bank. assuming that happens, such a big rise in remittance could keep us cool for a while.
the convicted and corrupt at the polls
electioneering has kicked off in four city corporations and nine municipalities for the august 4 polls, as the candidates running for mayor and ward councilor posts have formally started their campaign after the emergency power rules (epr) was relaxed further. but allowing a good number of convicts and corrupt people to run in the polls is surely a disturbing development. most of these contenders are ward commissioners, who were either behind bars or in hiding after promulgation of the emergency.
the necessity of inter-faith dialogue

dilapidated cyclone shelter
as part of my office assignment recently i visited subornochar, noakhali. local people requested me to see a cyclone shelter at char clerk. it was built a few decades ago. its present condition is very dangerous and it may collapse any time. there is an adjacent school and playground. its collapse can lead to a disaster.
us envoy's response
i was surprised by your editorial of july 17, which implied that foreign diplomats should not talk to politicians. in my role as a diplomat in bangladesh, i need to understand the issues of the people and the government here. the only way to understand is to communicate, to listen and question the person on the street as well as the leaders of the government and political parties.
how much land does a man need?
it is a story we read in our school life. it was an interesting story for teenagers and i believe most of the people of our age must have read it in the rapid reader. however, for the information of others who have not read it, very briefly i put here the gist. the story went like thi-- a rich man having huge landed property wanted to help his onetime friend, who was very poor. one day he called his poor friend and told him that he would give as much land as he could circle around by running from sunrise to sunset. accordingly, on a fine morning, in presence of some witnesses, the poor friend started running from a fixed point to circle as much area as he could circle by sunset. from the very onset, the man started running as fast as he could covering more and more better lands he found to bring into his fold. he totally forgot that he would have to return before the sun is set. the greed overtook him and failed to notice that the sun was gradually setting on the west. his only concentration was covering more and more better land he found on his way. while little time was remaining for the sun to set he was standing far away from the starting point and out of reach. sensing this difficult situation he increased his speed at the top of his capacity. he used all his physical powers to return to the starting point before sunset but all in vain. finally, while he was just a few yards away from the touching point he fell down on the ground and died of exhaustion. the rest of the story need not be mentioned here.
rajuk's new rule
at last the cat was out of the bag on 29 may 2008. the government issued the gazette notification on the building construction act dated 27 may 2008. our long waiting and anxiousness has come to an end after a year and a half. for the first time appreciable guidelines/ rules have been incorporated in the above gazette, to be followed by the developers and the land owners.
no dearth of talent
i was quite amazed when i saw a report in your daily on july 10, 2008 about a young boy of dinajpur who had invented an environment-friendly power plant that can be operated without any fuel input like gas or coal. the report also specifies that it will also not emit smokes. this again proves that our country really has talented people. all we need is a visionary leader to guide these talented people towards betterment of the country.
indo-bangla mobile phone service
i was wondering if mobile phone service providers in bangladesh could come into an agreement with their counterparts in india and offer cheap call rates for the benefit of the peoples of both the countries. it is not that we cannot reach our relations and friends in india over our mobile phones but the rates are so high that you have to think twice before dialling a call. it is an irony that we can call on our mobile phones to our relations and friends in europe, us and the far east at a concessionary rate but making a call to india costs three times more!
tv advertisements
children love to discover new things from different sources, especially television. generally, they are very inquisitive about everything. in this case, tv advertisements (ads) are a great source of their entertainment as well as learning. but various advertisements present their message in such a way that the kids don't learn better things. those ads are misleading and sending incorrect messages. so, the authorities should be much more conscious in this respect. some examples will help us to realise the issue.
flood resistant rice plant
your report with photograph, published on 12 july on the subject, joint effort of irri and brri scientists, is the best news for bangladesh today. it will herald a new era of rice productivity for us. i salute the scientists for their dedication and hard toil unknown to us!
persistent load shedding
we have to suffer due to electricity disruption for at least five-six hours every day. actually, sufferings of the general people have increased as the prices of almost every essential commodity have gone high. however, people work after sunset because daytime is not enough to finish all the works. the frequency of load shedding has gone up with the per unit cost of electricity. on the other hand, people need to spend money for making the provision for light at night.
brta registration and annual tax
there have been numerous claims against false registration of cars as well as yearly tax deposit. despite the various measures adopted by the government, some unscrupulous people in different post offices have made their fortunes by resorting to fraudulent activities. most interestingly, one can't detect this until & unless the person is going to sell his/her car to somebody else. during this sale /purchase, the owner of the car knows the actual picture as the buyer who checks the same with the brta authority finds that the seller has 4/5 years' registration fees unpaid. in fact the seller paid his dues to brta authorities through post offices on yearly basis but those amounts were never deposited!!
school students' ordeal
in a recent news report covering a road show, we saw school students welcoming the dignitaries waiving flags. it is good to see on television. but we do not see the other side of the picture. how long did these students wait in the road? we have no idea how many of them got sick for doing so.
