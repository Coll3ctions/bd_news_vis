is the perception close to reality?
let us consider two important, internationally considered reliable, recent reports on corruption to understand the position of bangladesh.
corporate helping hand
the role of the private sector in the global economy has increased over the years. in bangladesh, the private sector's involvement in the economy has steadily increased over the last two decades. according to some estimates, the sector accounted for more than 99% of the exports, 93% of the employment, and 75%, 73% and 89% of the investment, fixed assets and value added, respectively, in 2004, against 26%, 71%, 29%, 66% and 44% respectively in 1980. the situation has not changed radically since then.
a mariner's nightmare

reporting on corruption: a view from the ingo sector
the recent household survey of corruption conducted by transparency international bangladesh (tib) has evoked debate in different corners of the society, most publicly in the newspapers and on television. this debate is important, and as respected ingos we have a contribution to add to this. view the page science & life
astrophysical dark matter
the 'dark' matter is called 'dark' as it does not radiate or absorb light. it has only gravitation and weak interactions. there are two types of dark matters: the hot dark matter (hdm) and the cold dark matter (cdm). hot dark matter occurred during the earlier stage of the universe while the cold dark matter occurred later. examples of cold dark matter may be neutron stars, black holes and brown dwarfs. these objects are not directly observables as they do not emit. but their presence can be detectable due to their strong gravitational effects on the surroundings.
elusive saharan cheetah
the mysterious saharan cheetah is an ultra-secretive elusive creature. a sub-species of cheetah, it is also known as the northwest african cheetah. it was only back in 2009 that scientists from the zoological society of london were able to photograph one for the first time using a nighttime camera trap in the algerian deserts. and very recently (december, 2010) scientists from the saharan conservation fund (scf) photographed the wild cat in the deserts of the termit massif, niger. as these cats are very rare, the international union for conservation of nature (iucn) has classified them as critically endangered species. and naturally the image captured by the scientists from scf has created a great enthusiasm among the conservationists as many believe that fewer than 10 of such cats survive in the harsh deserts of termit, niger. experts also believe that the total number of saharan cheetah (scientific name acinonyx jubatus hecki) is somewhere around 250.
planets beyond solar family
the discovery of a planet orbiting a dim dwarf star about 20 light-years from earth has encouraged astronomers in their hunt for habitable, and maybe even inhabited, worlds elsewhere in the galaxy astronomers suspect that dozens of potentially habitable worlds will be discovered as the number of known exoplanets continues to climb.
when black hole was born
most galaxies in the universe, including our own milky way, harbor super-massive black holes varying in mass from about one million to about 10 billion times the size of our sun. to find them, astronomers look for the enormous amount of radiation emitted by gas which falls into such objects during the times that the black holes are "active," i.e., accreting matter. this gas "infall" into massive black holes is believed to be the means by which black holes grow.
oldest human remains
israeli archaeologists have discovered human remains dating from 400,000 years ago, challenging conventional wisdom that homo sapiens originated in africa, the leader of excavations in israel said on tuesday.
the body-mind connection
medical science is only beginning to understand the ways in which the mind influences the body. the placebo effect, for example, demonstrates that people can at times cause a relief in medical symptoms or suffering by believing the cures to be effective - whether they actually are or not. using processes only poorly understood, the body's ability to heal itself is far more amazing than anything modern medicine could create.
what's the hubbert peak theory?
the hubbert peak theory posits that for any given geographical area, from an individual oil-producing region to the planet as a whole, the rate of petroleum production tends to follow a bell-shaped curve. it is one of the primary theories on peak oil. the theory is named after american geophysicist m. king hubbert, who created a method of modeling the production curve given an assumed ultimate recovery volume.
