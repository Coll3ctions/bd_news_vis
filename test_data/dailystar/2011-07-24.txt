the carnage in norway
the carnage which has left as many as ninety one people dead in the norwegian capital oslo and on the nearby island of utoya has sent shock waves around the world. the force of the blast in oslo, which killed seven and injured scores, left buildings in ruins in an area housing the prime minister's office and other government establishments. but a far bigger tragedy occurred within two hours of the explosion in oslo when a gunman, suspected to belong to the political far right, shot down eighty four people. the fear is that the casualty figures may rise. more to the point, there is the very natural suspicion that the gunman may not have been acting alone. an eyewitness to the tragedy on utoya island, himself injured, has spoken of the gunman wearing a uniform that gave him a nazi-like appearance. view the page sports

their last triumph
we all know about the mirsarai tragedy where 43 students were killed due to reckless driving of a farmer. as a student i feel very sad over the fact but i feel much worse when i think that they were like me, and they were coming after wining a football match. all of them had smiles all over their faces. the glory of wining was shining in their eyes, but who knew that it would be their last triumph? among those 43 boys 7 of them were only son of their parents, which also matches with me. almighty allah's thoughts are unpredictable! i think he warned us to be aware and take action against these stupid cruel people who only looks for their profit. the whole nation is mourning their death. maybe someone from them would show us the right path. the culprit should be punished.alas, it was their last football match, their last smiling, their last glory, their last triumph!

slaughter of the six
it was indeed very sad to know that six students have been killed brutally by the mob during the holy night of shab-e-barat. what really hurts me is the insane act of the people, who without thinking went for the killing. in bangladesh it has become a common scenario…when we grab any criminal, without knowing whether they are guilty or not, we kill them by beating. why are people so cruel these days? we tend to unleash all our anger and frustrations on those people. how those six lives were lost in front of police? please hand the accused over to the law enforcers before you go for the killing game. find the true culprits behind these murders and give them exemplary punishment which may discourage others to do these heinous acts in future.

constitution controversy
bangladesh constitution has been amended 15 times. on all previous 14 amendments no one cared to arrange any public debate not to speak of inviting opposition to discuss. 15th amendment is made perhaps with an unusual long discourse. awami league led grand alliance government tried to elicit opinion of all concerned before placing the all important bill. the amendment passed duly. bnp led opposition boycotted all the processes including parliament sessions. now they have taken the path of agitation and other destructive means to ventilate their opinions. the leader of the opposition even made audacious gesture like 'throwing away' the constitution. this attitude is not in conformity with the democratic norms. the same party is also agitating against charge sheets of sensational 21st august carnage and 10 truck arms haul case. we do not want to comment on under trial cases but these are all true cases. let the truth be established in open trial. government should be firm to establish rule of law. opposition should stick to lawful process. the constitution of the country is sacred document. none will be allowed to throw it away.

mala and i were relishing a leisurely latte at starbucks and chatting about …whatever it is that friends who meet after a gap of six months talk about… "shoes and ships and ceiling wax and cabbages and kings?" suddenly we were hit by a gust of nostalgia about the "good old days!"
support efforts towards autism welfare
it is really encouraging that the international autism conference will be held on july 25-26 in dhaka, which would come up with a "dhaka declaration" for helping the autistic children around the world. it is reported the organising institute is the bangbandhu sheikh mujib medical university (bsmmu) based on the support and initiative by saima wazed putul daughter of prime minister sheikh hasina. she is the main organizer and a guest speaker.
long term weather forecast neglected
modern weather forecasting has improved a lot with the introduction of satellites and radar in addition to ground observations. but in bangladesh, we don't seem to be utilising all these facilities. heavy rainfall very often brings floods and landslides in cox's bazar and chittagong areas, and it is noticeable that no adequate advanced warning is given about these events.
