before north korea exploded a nuclear device, it was argued that if north korea was allowed to go nuclear, it would destabilise the asia-pacific region. to counter a nuclear-armed north korea, japan would also go nuclear, raising china's historical fear about japan. south korea, fearing a north korean invasion, would also go nuclear and the whole region would see a nuclear arms race similar to soviet-american nuclear arms race during the cold war era. many neo-conservatives in the u.s. had called for a pre-emptive strike on north korea before it developed the bomb.
save karnaphuli!
thanks to the crass commercialisation and continuous dumping of highly toxic liquid and solid wastes into the karnaphuli river. it is suffocating the feline of our country's economy! experts say that the riverside factories, human waste, oil spilling by boats and vessels are responsible for pollution. once the karnaphuli used to be the haven of fishes, but now most of the fish species have vanished! "department of environment (doe) and chittagong city corporation (ccc) have failed to save the river from pollution, as about 300 factories on the banks of the river are discharging wastes into the river," says idris ali, professor of chittagong college, who has been working on the pollution of the karnaphuli river for two decades. is anyone even a wee bit concerned about the fact? doe director admitted the bad condition of the river. he said that according to the high court order, they asked the factories to set up etps(effluents treatment plants). idris ali has said that the renowned factories like kafco have no etps to treat wastes. local people say that now even fishermen don't go fishing.

let's stand beside them
a few days back, a friend and i went to apon- a drug rehabilitation centre, as part of a research work of our department. the conversation we had with the teenaged drug addicts changed our perception about them. many of them are abandoned by either their father or mother. in most of the cases, their mothers were divorced and then got married again. as a result, they had no place to go but to live on the street. in some cases, after their father or mother's death they were forced to leave home and became street children. what is most depressing is that almost all the street boys are addicted to drugs and involved in crimes and different kinds of anti-social activities. their average age is not more than 13 or 14 years. if every one of us takes the responsibility to bring them in the mainstream of society, the situation will change radically. it is our moral duty to stand beside these children.
overcrowded classrooms
the classrooms of our government-run colleges are overcrowded. the students who have to attend the classes and the teachers who have to take the classes know what a noisy situation prevails there. rows of benches packed with students - with five or more students sharing a single bench - is a common sight of these classrooms. as many as one hundred and fifty students sit in a single room.
the example that farzana set
dowry system is a deep-rooted problem in our society. it is an amount of money or property given by the bride's family to the bridegroom's family. dowry prevails in our society in various forms. sometimes money is directly given as dowry, sometimes various luxury products are given. the situation is worse in the lower class of society.

promoting bangla films
this is the proper time to establish a film city in our country and save our film industry and as our culture. bangladesh film development corporation (bfdc) should be rebuilt so that quality films can be made there. during the last eid-ul-azha five movies were released. among them four movies got good response from the audience. the directors and producers of these movies are happy in their success. now, for the sake of our film industry the government should establish a film city in the country. besides, a group of young filmmakers are trying to make good films. we hope the government will take some initiatives to promote these promising filmmakers.

ouster is a bad word . . . in these times
the bangladesh nationalist party has said it loud and clear. the awami league-led government, it informs the country, must be ousted in order to protect the country. and how do you observe that statement? for starters, you could tell the opposition that you can only agree with it halfway. and that is to inform it that the country is always in need of protection, always requiring the highest degree of security in order to carry on. and that ouster idea? that is a fine term, ouster, and we have over the past five decades or so been witness to the many spells of ouster governments have been subjected to by ambitious military officers across the globe. and then think of this lovely land of ours. every ouster of a government has brought with it an end to the lives of the great and the good. by extension, each ouster has seen a newer, swifter decline in values. but oust an elected government? that very thought is in bad taste. it reveals two things. the first is an absence of pluralistic sentiment in those who simply do not know the ramifications of the term. the second is that a call for the ouster of a government voted to power by the majority of people in a country is akin to undermining the sovereign right of a society to make informed political choices for itself.
why afspa must go

shale gas: a burning issue
the issue seems rather similar to that of unconventional oil and has already sparked a major controversy in the west. but its implications for the debate on climate change are hardly known in countries of the global south. on november 6, thousands of protesters staged a colourful encirclement of the white house, protesting against the keystone xl pipeline-project and against expansion in extraction of tar sands oil. four days after this, obama ordered a thorough review of the pipeline plan and suspended decision-making on its construction.
