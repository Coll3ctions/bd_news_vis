our citizens in distress abroad
ten thousand bangladeshis are said to be languishing in prisons in foreign countries under different charges like overstaying, violation of statutory conditions of visa including criminal offences. in bits and pieces we have heard about our citizens being stranded, detained, im-prisoned and deported, but only when such a consoli-dated figure appears in print that we sit up and take note. or do we? may be we would be nudged to feel for them, perhaps only momentarily, at their plight in in-hospitable conditions and curse their gullibility in keeping faith with cheats.
removal of judges in pakistan
the move by the pakistan government to send 37 judges of the supreme court and the various high courts into forcible retirement spells grave danger not only for pakistan's judiciary but also for the future of its politics. at a time when the country's politicians, law-yers and other classes of people are engaged in a strug-gle to have democracy underpin the political process, the dismissal of the judges, for dismissal it is, smacks of a crude attempt to have a pliant judicial system in place for pakistan's rulers.
back against the wall

trial of anti-liberation forces

ban on religious parties
recently, some political parties have appealed to the ec to ban religion-based political parties from participating in elections. they argue that the founders of the religion-based parties are war criminals and also that allowing such parties to contest in elections will go against the secular nature of the state. well, i am not writing in support of any proven war criminal, but i want to assert that the founders of all religion-based parties are not proven war criminals. the spirit of our liberation war was to ensure that every individual has the right to practise his/her respective religion peacefully. the constitution of bangladesh also guarantees different political parties having different political ideologies to contest in polls with the common people reserving the right to decide which one of them should rule the country.
36 years under scrutiny
after 36 years of independence a section of the population complains of total failure of bangladesh's entire state system--socio-political and socio-economic. unfortunately, they are correct to a certain extent. what is extremely unfortunate is that the exponents of this theory do not want to recognise even whatever little we have achieved under adverse circumstances.
our prime ministers
there is always a good timing to do everything in life. if anyone can hit the perfect time, he will get the best score in his life. taking great decisions and accepting real facts of life, anyone can make his or her life peaceful, and can create a nice world.
undemocratic
i strongly feel that the war criminals should have been tried long before, but the demand for such trials appear to have come at a wrong time and from the wrong people. the people who virtually established the jamaat in national politics have now suddenly become vocal and want to put the gun on someone else's shoulder to wipe them out. one gets a strong feeling that the jamaat, by now, has already made inroads into national politics and even if they compete independently in the coming election they are likely to become a force to reckon with. keeping this in mind they are now out to eliminate the jamaat on some pretext or the other. let the people decide whether they should be eliminated or not through the ballots. the law adviser has rightly pointed out that they don't want to be a scapegoat to handle such a sensitive issue and those who have not tried the war criminals in the last 36 years should be taken to task first. view the page international

coping with cyclone
we have lost everything we worked for during our lives. we do not know when and where to start again" was what i heard from most of the people of the devastated areas that i visited last week. manikhali, betaki and amtali are the three places that i along with a few others visited after the ravaging cyclone sidr, which razed everything on the fateful night of november 15.
basket case or recipe for success?
out in the ravaged fields, days after cyclone sidr hit bangladesh, the devastation was everywhere. flattened houses, crops, trees, dead livestock and, sadly, also people. yet even more evident was the resilient bangladeshi spirit.
forget war with iran
president bush, in his news conference this week, said "nothing's changed" about the u.s. approach to iran. on the contrary, everything has. what the u.s. president failed to acknowledge was that there had been an earthquake in washington, which came in the form of this week's new national intelligence estimate (nie) on iran. the most immediate impact is that the nie resolved the big question hanging over the last 12 months of bush's troubled tenure as president: will he attack iran? the answer now is almost certainly no. the report also means that a host of international actors who are not necessarily friendly to america -- from iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad to russia's vladimir putin to mohamed elbaradei, the controversial head of the international atomic energy agency -- come out looking like winners. america's reputation in the world is the biggest loser.
