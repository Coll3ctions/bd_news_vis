work plan of the law commission
the law commission, for all the inactivity it has been forced into since it came into being thirteen years ago, remains undaunted. it has just formulated a work plan for itself for the next two years. that is indeed a bold move, but for such a move to be translated into reality on the ground it will need a good deal of spirit and energy. experience shows only too clearly that it has in the past made as many as 88 recommendations on the law and its various aspects to the government. now, obviously, such a number is remarkable. the unfortunate bit in the story is that no more than four or five of these recommendations have been accepted by successive governments. which brings up the matter of whether governments, political in nature as they are, have ever been ready and willing to take the law commission seriously? one feels here a whiff of the partisan. every time a new government has taken over, it has found the reasons to keep the commission at bay.
road congestion
things are back to square one as far as traffic management is concerned. after the short-lived respite during eid holidays the everyday urban menace called traffic congestion is back with a bang. throughout the week thousands of vehicles of every description are to be seen clogging the main roads and alleyways of the metropolis from morning till midnight. while traffic lights keep turning from red to green and back in sheer futility, exasperated policemen try to control the burgeoning number of vehicles with their hands. alternative system of modern and effective signalling is yet to be installed to address the situation.
obama's tricky prize
the norwegian nobel committee has stunned the world with its announcement of the nobel peace prize for 2009. of the 205 names in the list, us president obviously was the most prominent personality in the world to draw the attention of the nobel committee. but his being the most powerful and illustrious global celebrity apart, many have questioned the wisdom of the nobel committee for its decision to exalt barack obama so early in his career in the us presidency as he is yet to deliver the promises he made to the people of the us and the world at large. the former polish president and winner of the peace prize in 1983, for instance, exclaimed in reaction to obama's luck saying, "so soon? too early… he is only beginning to act." in a similar vein the former us ambassador to un john bolton called "it is indicative of the politicisation of the nobel peace prize process. this just carries it to the n-th degree." on the other hand, the 2002's nobel peace winner former democratic us president jimmy carter welcomed the nobel prize committee's decision as "a bold statement of international support for his vision and commitment."

beggars and vehicles
in the streets of dhaka city private cars and beggars have increased in huge numbers. the common increase of private cars and beggars is synonymous which may have some meaning from economic point of view. private cars have increased traffic jam and beggars also cause traffic jam. but here the point of interest is beggars not private cars. the beggars are poor but all poor are not beggars. there are professional beggars too. women beggars with babies are common. some people pretending to be pir/fakir are also found begging. children are also engaged in begging. foreigners visiting the country fall prey to the beggars. there are beggars everywhere round the clock. it is often seen that crippled beggars are lying on footpaths suffering from cancer, leprosy, malignant tumour, swollen, protruded eyes etc. religious places like mosques and mazars are full of beggars. during prayer time men, women and children remain awaiting outside for begging while devotees are praying inside the mosque, as if beggars need not pray. there is also no question about men and women begging together. it appears that beggars need not be worried about heaven and hell.

shift bina from bau campus
bangladesh institute of nuclear agriculture (bina), a national research institute, can't run its research and administration smoothly because of bad student politics. as it is located on bangladesh agricultural university (bau) campus, leaders from the ruling party demand 'chanda' from its employees, tinker with the tender process, recruitment is based on the ruling party's list and, above all, the entire administration is totally helpless because of their dominant role in every situation. the authorities can't take any decision against the ruling party student leaders, all the time the leaders enter into bina campus and threaten the authorities with dire consequences.
facilities only?
the 3rd session of parliament resumed on 4 october and participation of the main opposition is again uncertain. this is really disappointing. the 29th december parliamentary election was an overwhelming election where all the voters from all sectors of society participated spontaneously. it is true that in most of the constituencies the bnp did not come out victorious, but in every constituency the bnp candidate got a lot of votes. so why are they not participating? they are the representatives of the voters. but i think that the bnp does not think like this. they are only thinking about their personal and political issues. they should put their position and activities on the manifesto as an opposition party. because it could help the voters to rethink on the issue of casting their votes for the bnp.

young people
the thoughts, principles and energies of young men and women are vital for the continuing development of the societies in which they live. the evils of young men and women, as well as their dreams and aspirations, are a necessary constituent of the challenges facing today's societies and future generations. in all parts of the earth, young citizens, living in countries at diverse stages of growth and in different socio-economic situations, aspire to live better lives in their societies. convinced elements would help this process, such as ensuring education, access to employment opportunities, adequate food and nutrition, a physical as well as social atmosphere that promotes high-quality health and protection from disease, pleasure of human rights and basic freedom, contribution to decision-making processes etc.

crossfire killings
i refer to your editorial of 5 october. although such killings are regrettable, the law and order forces have a duty to interrogate and recover arms and explosives from criminal gangs and have an inherent right to defend themselves if under attack. similarly, if a criminal attempts to escape they have a duty to give warning and if it fails, to stop escape by shooting down the escapee. view the page international
