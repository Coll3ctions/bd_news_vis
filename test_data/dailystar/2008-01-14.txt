question paper leakage
only the other day we had expressed our dismay at question paper leakage in dhaka university in this column. we had urged the government to take strong measures to prevent recurrence of such incident so that honest students did not suffer in the process. but before we heard of any worthy measures taken by the authorities towards apprehending the network of criminals, the story of leakage of 2nd year honours english compulsory examination 2006 question paper in the national university (nu) came as a shocker. the leakage fiasco forced students of a number of nu affiliated institutions like dhaka college and eden college come out protesting on streets, which subsequently led to the suspension of the examination. we believe nu has formed a three-member investigation committee to get to the bottom of it and submit a report in seven days. it only remains to be seen whether this committee will deliver the goods or meet the same fate like that of the numerous ones in the past thrown into the cold chamber.
the myth of an american century!
even if obfuscated by gory development in our neighbourhood -- the assassination of pakistan's charismatic leader, benazir bhutto and its widespread repercussions -- two events of global significance couldn't but stand out as the year 2007 eclipsed in the sea of eternity. the first one was time magazine giving vladimir putin, the steely-eyed russian leader, the accolade of person of the year. the second was the purchase by the china investment corporation of nearly 10 percent of the american bank, morgan stanley, as it announced the write-off of $9.4bn bad debts. here is an attempt to put the events in some historical perspective.
knockout time
the logic of the last round can be significantly different from the strategies that have sustained a heavyweight bout thus far. when the contestants hear the final bell, they can be sure of two things in a democracy tournament: there will be a winner or a loser, because there is nothing called an inconclusive draw. two, time is finite.

“flaws in cng conversion”
i came across the letter from my friend mr. mansoor on the above subject published in your newspaper on 31st december. i feel i must reply to this as he has found a large number of reasons for the recent cng explosions. blaming a lot of people does not help, as the real reason for these explosions cannot be identified by wholesale blaming of everyone.
election on schedule …
the present ctg deserves our salutes; they've been doing what the whole nation expects them to do. they've uprooted the multifaceted vices that had been eating up the backbone of this country; they've glued up the cracks in the democratic fabric of the republic-- the holes for the rats of the dark are severely battered. the present price hike will hopefully be resolved by this "few good men" soon.
saga of load-shedding!
the above depressing news was published in the first page of most newspapers on the last day of 2007. a demoralising beginning of the new year! the adviser concerned prepared everyone for the worst in his press briefing. despite all the plans, the proposed rationing (load-shedding) of electricity supply has condemned all of us to living in partial darkness. hopefully, this time around it will be more democratically administered with equal misery for all and not favouring some at the expense of others, which was the practice in the past.
benazir bhutto
benazir is gone…as soon as i heard this news i felt a kind of trembling inside me, which i was not able to control. interestingly when benazir was in the scene years back and she was sent on self-exile, i was just a kid to understand either benazir or her politics. just for the last two or three years, i have started generating my own understanding regarding politics and since then i have started admiring benazir bhutto, suu kyi and sonia gandhi. it is true that against benazir there was charge of corruption and more specifically perhaps her husband is responsible for her downfall. for a girl like me, benazir was always a charismatic figure with her great look, talent, western education and personality along with media attention. her uniquely designed coat with milk white scarf, eyes covered with fashion glasses and the fusion of being a mother and a political figure were always eye-catching.
transparency in government
the people of bangladesh have yet to witness a transparent government. we expected that the current caretaker/interim government (the actual terminology remains unclear to this day) would pave the way for transparency. before attempting to bring about positive reforms in the political parties, people expected that the present government itself would practise good governance. we are well accustomed to observing the mud slinging by the ruling and opposition parties in the past. now we are witnessing the same trend in the present government on the issues pertaining to lifting the ban on politics, ending the emergency rule, bringing the war criminals to justice, sending archaeological artefacts abroad, and skyrocketing price of rice and commodities. now all blame goes to the major political parties, business sectors, and some vested (yet unidentified) quarters.
biman issue
this refers to an article on boeing for biman appearing in your paper.
policy guideline for nrbs
the clarion call of the chief adviser to the nrbs to contribute in the economy of bangladesh was timely and thus commendable. non-resident citizens of china , india , philippines and korea, in fact, made massive contributions to their countries' socio-economic development. there should be a well designed guideline indicating their areas of participation and facilities to be provided to them with banking facilities and return of profits.
is it true?
i wonder if any human rights organisations would be interested in checking out a story i have heard that some of the fishing boats that were lost in the cyclone may very well have not been carrying warning devices of any kind, intentionally. someone told me that some fishing boat owners do not want their boats to be coming back at every storm warning for fear of loss of income.
leaders and legal process
a recent news item published in the prothom alo caught my attention. in a joint statement forty-one eminent citizens of bangladesh expressed concern about the illness of the former prime minister and awami league leader sheikh hasina and asked for her release from detention (the prothom alo, 2 january 2008). considering her significant role in establishing democracy, rule of law and people's welfare, the eminent citizens asked the government to release hasina and to provide proper medical treatment for her illness.
resuscitation of mongla port
the recent reports appearing in different newspapers about the present condition of mongla port give an impression that the closing down of the port operation is a matter of time. this news hurt the countrymen, may be highly disappointing news for me, being the ex-chairman of that ill-fated port. there are many reasons for the port to malfunction but the reason most highlighted-- the silt deposit problem of river pasur-- may not be the correct one. the years 1997 and 1998 when i was the chairman had the record earning and net profit of the port for whatever reason (this is on record). this only establishes the fact that a concerted effort by all concerned can make this port vibrant again. needless to say, the country with roughly fifteen million people cannot depend only on one seaport i.e. chittagong. for safety and security of the country we must put all efforts for mongla port's survival. view the page international
