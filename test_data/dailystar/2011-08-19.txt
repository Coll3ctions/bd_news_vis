gas at sundalpur
the news that the state-owned bangladesh petroleum exploration and production company limited, in short, bapex, has struck a gas field at sundalpur in noakhali is indeed a breath of fresh air. it could not have come a day later when the country is facing a severe gas crisis of 500 million cubic feet of gas per day (mmcfd).
hc move against two hospitals
the move by a high court bench to seek explanations from two private hospitals on the deaths of some patients in recent days should be the beginning of a process to hold medical authorities to account. a few days ago, dr. mridul kanti chakrabarty, a senior teacher at dhaka university's department of music and a reputed scholar, allegedly died of negligence at labaid hospital. suffering from dehydration, he was, as reports would have it, made to wait a pretty long time for treatment. his death, it is fair to suppose, could certainly have been prevented had doctors at labaid, one of the more expensive medical facilities in the country, taken quick action. view the page sports

the unbearable loss
it shook my heart when i came to learn the news of tragic death of mishuk munier, ceo of atn news and tareque masud, a noted filmmaker in a gruesome road crash. i know mishuk not only as a colleague for some time as a broadcast journalist, but as one of the talented sons of shaheed professor munier chowdhury- my dearest teacher of dhaka university. when i started teaching electronic journalism as a part-time teacher at the mass communication and journalism department of dhaka university, i found him as a colleague. mishuk took the initiative to bring some essential tools, particularly one editing machine and a video camera. however, he left the university to join ekushey tv, which truly was his field with all his dynamism and great diversity.
drawing room coaching
secondary schools teachers have spacious drawing rooms in their houses to accommodate a big number of students for private coaching. these drawing rooms are usually furnished with high and low benches, a chair and even with a blackboard hanging on the wall! a causal visitor will surely mistake such a drawing room for a classroom of a school! coaching goes on batch by batch in the morning and after the school hours. the agile teacher cleverly prepares a list of probable questions of the subjects he teaches. he also prepares a list of probable questions of all other major subjects in a close exam-oriented collaboration with his colleagues who are also engaged in similar coaching business! they believe in the philosophy of honest reciprocity for the success of their business! the youngsters are asked only to memorize the answers and they are given cent percent assurance of a smooth class promotion in the most shortcut way! thus, a solid foundation is being laid for our future rural citizenry!
stop reckless driving
undoubtedly, reckless driving is the main cause of road accidents in our country. drivers of all types of transports compete for overtaking one another. the drivers enjoy this lethal racing game on city roads and also on highways. very often we can see in the highways that during overtaking each other, no passage is left in the right side of the road for the vehicles coming from opposite direction. many head-on collisions between two transports are happening for this reason. interestingly, some passengers on board encourage the drivers to win the race instead of abstaining them from it.only mindful and responsible driving can save many lives. if the drivers of all types of vehicles are considerate to their colleagues working in other vehicles, it really can reduce road accidents significantly.
whose negligence is it?
some losses can never be compensated. the loss of abid, a promising singer of our country, is one. every year accidents happen when tourists visit the cox's bazar sea beach. more than fifty people have died in the quicksand of the beach during the last fifteen years. only 21 coast guards are there to provide security to the visitors. is it enough to ensure proper safety when accidents are taking place quite frequently? lack of awareness of the tourists is highly criticized after every accident takes place. but isn't it the duty of the authorities too to make tourists aware?

the economist's "embraceable you "
i have read with interest the recent article published by the economist (july 30th august 5th) and find our government's reaction somewhat exaggerated. the analysis had more to do with india's approach to fast tracking its good neighbourly relations than having a dig at bangladesh's political situation. for those of us familiar with the economist, the observations were routine and in line with previous write-ups. to the government's credit it refrained from making the elementary mistake of deleting sections of the article or, unthinkably, banning the issue. for the depth of its analysis, fluidity of presentation and uncanny knack to predict the future the economist has come to be a must read for so many government functionaries and policymakers. it spotted obama way before he became a threat to hilary and in recent times has heaped praise on the arab spring arguing that its inherent democratic strength far outweighs the dangers of islamic fundamentalism. following on from its leader, it criticized india for its over-reliance on the awami league and shunning meetings with the bnp. for its part the awami league must therefore demonstrate its maturity in engaging in bi-partisan politics. the awami league would do well to concentrate on core issues: improving the lot of the poor, drastic steps to improve infrastructure (some achievements like reduction in infant mortality rates and rise in agricultural output are praiseworthy but more needs to be done), seen to be tolerant and ensuring justice on a level playing field. it will then be a matter of time before the economist says less about this “beggar infested city of dhaka” and more about the emerging tiger of south asia. oh, wouldn't that be wonderful!
be proactive please
no two people are similar. foreign minister dipu moni is right that the family of sheikh hasina and khaleda zia are different in respect of education and lifestyle. the economist's report did not point to this difference. the recent happenings across the country prove that people are reeling under government's misrule: innocent students like kader and limon are subjected to barbarous treatment at the hands of police who are supposed to protect innocent people. things have come to such a pass that government's sweet will rather than the rule of law determines every affair of the state. at the face of such atrocities media from home and abroad are doing their commendable job of warning the government but the government seems to be incorrigible and unheeded to all those calls for justice and respectability. people do not bother whether the 2008 election was masterminded by india, what they want is respectable living in peace and security. people seem to be waiting patiently for the government to be proactive and return to sense.
