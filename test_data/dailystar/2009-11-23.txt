sheikh hasina's call to khaleda zia
prime minister sheikh hasina on saturday urged leader of the opposition khaleda zia, through jatiya sangsad speaker abdul hamid, to return to parliament with her party. we wish, and so does the country, that khaleda zia had reassured the nation through an emphatic yes. but that was too much to expect from a single gesture of goodwill; yet, the big question is: why should the bangladesh nationalist party have boycotted the js for such an inordinately long time, doing neither any good to the party nor to the country?
denial of crossfire deaths
we do not want to quote figures - even one death is one too many if that occurs due to abridgment of the due process of law. but so called crossfire has put a blot in the country's image, not to speak of the fact that public confidence, in the government and in those that people seek protection of, has been eroded badly and the credibility of some ministers severely dented.

significance of armed forces day
november 21, 1971, a glorious day of our national history: on this day combined forces of bangladesh army, navy and air force launched a concerted effort to put down the occupation army of pakistan on the wake of unprecedented genocide conducted by them. on this very day armed forces of bangladesh took a ceremonious birth. although november 21, 1971 is marked to be the raising day of the bangladesh armed forces, the bengali members of army, navy and air force conducted operations in their respective domains against the occupation forces from march 26, 1971. these organs of the armed forces had been carrying out massive destruction of the occupation forces during the liberation war without any pragmatic national directives and military planning. as a matter of fact in the tense situation of our national life in those days when occupation forces were committing inhuman atrocities all over east pakistan, the armed forces of bangladesh came into being to confront the occupation forces. view the page sports

poaching
the three hill-tracts of bangladesh namely rangamati, khagrachari & bandarban are not only commendable for there natural beauty but these regions are also full of natural resources. these account for one-third forest resources of our country. wild animals, trees, agricultural resources etc are found aplenty in these regions. recently, a news report was published in one newspaper that a wild elephant was found dead in bandarban. more than 12 elephants were killed by poachers in recent times.
climate change
global climate change poses a potential danger to the development efforts, ecosystem and productive capacity of our environment. climate change particularly the temperature rise due to greenhouse gases may cause rise of sea level. according to one study, one meter net rise of the sea level would inundate 17% of the total area of bangladesh, particularly the low lying flood plain and coastal areas, including sundarbans and man made coastal mangrove forests. it is a big threat to land use, its system, related sectors and overall ecology and economy.
bnp council
the leaders of the bnp were spreading apprehension about the possible obstacles to holding the council on time. as usual the blame is put on the government party. however, my observation is , if they want to go ahead despite all the obstacles {?}, one possible catch is already there. this is regarding the venue of the proposed council. we heard on the media news that they would hold the council in the “bangabandhu international convention centre.” the question remains when and under what name the bnp will apply for that centre. they had renamed the centre after their taking over of power in 2001. i have never heard any top bnp leader to utter the word " bangabandhu" of " jatir pita". therefore, the high command of the bnp might not agree to apply for the centre under its present name. they might use the name they changed to. this is the catch i just foresee because the bnp might look for any single opportunity to blame the government if they do not get the centre using the changed name. this is just a characterisation of our overall political culture, especially the policy of the bnp.
