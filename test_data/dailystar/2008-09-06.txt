a growing propensity toward violence
we are concerned at the growing tendency on the part of a section of students to resort to violence on any pretext whatsoever. a few weeks ago, agitation by students in the university area as well as dhaka college led to mindless violence which resulted in the death of an innocent trader. and now come reports of the vandalism let loose by students at pangu hospital because of what has been described as a non-fulfilment of their demands. it may well be that the students were provoked into violence. but the point is that students being the enlightened people they are ought not to succumb to such provocation.

how cruel is the coincidence that the birthday of mother teresa, who embodied love for indian children, should have fallen in the same week of august when two christian children and their mother were burnt alive by the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) at khandmal district in orissa. true, the naxalites have claimed that they have killed the hindu mahant (priest), swami laxmananda saraswati, because he had indulged in crimes against the christians. but the naxalites' statement is taken with a pinch of salt. the hindu extremists are said to be the real culprits.

return to democracy and the premonitions
there is no dispute as to the imperative of returning to a democratic polity, notwithstanding the increasingly discordant voices of the politicians and the flurry of bails of important corruption suspects. howsoever difficult and disconcerting it may be to punish the corrupt, we have to remember that punishing the bad hats is an urgent priority because we have to once for all put a stop to the rise of half-educated arrogant predators in the political arena. surely we do not wish to see the return of the likes of those criminally disposed young members of parliament of dhaka city and its periphery of the not-too- distant past. these fellows are now behind the bar and the sense of relief consequent upon their absence is there for anyone to see and appreciate.
prof noman -- a teacher extraordinaire
there are some persons in this planet of ours who do not need direct acquaintance for you to know them. i am not talking about a famous statesman or a celebrated writer or even a big artist. rather i am talking about a professor who was truly educated, a real connoisseur of learning with high ethical standards. that a man of letters would prove a connoisseur of learning is not to be taken for granted in our given social context; because, for most of the educated class here, education is only a means to make a living. but the professor i am referring to here was a man of learning as well as a connoisseur of education; though he was not the one to make newspaper headlines. he was a renowned man, one who was and continues to be, honourably enshrined in our hearts.

social forestry, exotic trees and monga
all over northern bangladesh the practice of planting fruit trees in and near homestead and other lands is being undermined in recent decades. this has happened soon after the campaign of social forestry programme publicising planting of certain quick-growing trees supposedly having higher timber-value. earlier, many fruit-bearing trees have been the sources of extra income as well as of supplementary food and nutrition during the monga crisis for many households. in particular, for example, seeds of jackfruits and creeper potato (gachh alu or machh alu)) stored earlier were used in case of food scarcity during the monga period. the timber of jackfruit trees is also of great value for furniture making as well as for house construction. during the last three decades or so there has been a rush for planting cheap trees of foreign origin under the social forestry programme of the government with the help of a number of ngos and commercial nurseries in northern bangladesh (also elsewhere in the country).

charlie chaplin and anjan das in bagerhat
a film festival in a city like dhaka is not a big deal for its dwellers, be it boishakh, or falgun or any other month. but when such a festival finds its way to a small town like bagerhat--however small the monetary resources and funding for advertising and mass gathering!--it is quite an event, a breakthrough in the context of a small town. especially when one considers that even khulna, the divisional city, has no such venture. to fully understand the impact of the film society, one has to take into account the context. bagerhat's filmgoers, much like other parts of the country, gradually shifted over to commercially-oriented hindi films on the back of the gradual degradation of our national movie industry over the past two decades. it was during this critical time, in 2002, that bagerhat film society, the brainchild of abdullah boni, was formed.with the slogan 'better film, better society', a committee was formed on august 30 with s. zakir hossain as president, abdullah boni as secretary, and mahmud rahman as chief organizer. it has arranged five successful festivals so far, all held at the auditorium of bagerhat cultural foundation located in the center of the town. june 2003 saw the first festival where bagerhat's inhabitants were given a chance to view movies that till now were seen perhaps by only dhakaites: charlie chaplin's 'the kid' and the polish oscar-winner 'no man's land' as well as bangla classics like satyajit roy's 'gopi gyne bagha byne'. however, as expected, turnout of an audience addicted to hindi movies was poor.
