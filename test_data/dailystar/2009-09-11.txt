tendering online by pdb is a right move

crime and extortion, as eid approaches

traffic jam & old vehicles
the brta is reportedly planning to withdraw 15 years old cars and other old vehicles from dhaka city as one of the measures to ease traffic congestion. the reason for traffic congestion in dhaka is not old vehicles only. the main reasons are road condition, excessive number of vehicles, mishandling by traffic police, ignorance of traffic rules, excessive number of pedestrians and their crossing of roads indiscriminately, contrasting speed of vehicles and in many areas rickshaws, narrow spaces of roads and by-lanes etc.
check noise pollution
i strongly support the resolution recently adopted by 'sundar jibon' and 'society for assistance to hearing impaired children (sahic)' demanding that the authorities check noise pollution and give rights to the affected people to file cases against the polluters.
opposition and js
the third session of the 9th js started on september 7. as was anticipated, the main opposition is continuing the boycott that they began in the previous session (budget). the budget was passed without the opposition scrutiny. now some more important issues are haunting the nation. some of those are deteriorating law and order (though the home ministry doesn't realize this), unabated price hike, monopoly in tender business, and lastly partisan promotion in the administration. but why does the opposition continue the boycott bypassing the interests of their voters and the nation as a whole? is the opposition doing it very illogically? i don't think so. the issue of seating arrangement has been wrong both ways. the last speaker gave all the front seats to the opposition perhaps deliberately; and the present speaker has done a wrong computation. he and his colleagues counted the jatiya party (jp) in the opposition and gave a few front seats to them. how funny! everybody knows jp is the second major component of the so-called grand alliance; their seats must logically be on the treasury side. however, if there are not sufficient seats in the treasury bench, the jp can borrow some seats from the back of the opposition bench. the speaker and the treasury mps must correct this computational error, provide some more front seats to the opposition and call them generously to come and to debate national issues. the call should be such that the js can do nothing in the opposition's absence, shunning a stance that they don't care much if the opposition joins or not.

garbage disposal
when we lived in germany from 1974 till 1985 we had the following way of deposing our daily rubbish: there was this so called "dustbin' where we had to throw in our "kitchen rubbish". and next to it there was a smaller "dustbin" where we had to dispose of every kind of plastic material, such as plastic bags or bottles, and there was still a smaller "dustbin" next to it, where we had to throw in any kind of finished batteries.
sartorial restrictions
the news was carried in the national dailies that an office order is under process for imposing a ban on wearing suit in the government offices during the hot months of the year. the purpose of this order is to save electricity by not using acs in government offices. earlier, the government introduced daylight saving time (dst) by pulling the clock forward by one hour which has been a futile exercise. instead of saving electricity the change of time has created a lot of confusions and problems for the citizens from different walks of life. a number of news items and write-ups are being published in different dailies to withdraw dst system.
dealing with extremists
the state minister of home affairs has recently announced that the government would welcome it if extremists decide to surrender voluntarily and take necessary steps in accordance with the provisions of law. since in the eye of law those persons are dubbed as criminals against whom murder and other cases are there; the only step as per the existing law the authorities perhaps could take was to arrest them upon surrender and put them on trial. but this process perhaps would not be acceptable to them. instead, they would first seek a general amnesty before surrender. as such the announcement though apparently was a good gesture but left many questions unanswered. at present there is no government policy or law to rehabilitate them. a few years back a large number of such extremists operating in the southern districts surrendered under a general amnesty to the authorities with the hope of starting a new life as law-abiding citizens of the country. the authorities also reportedly absorbed some of them in the police and ansar departments in different cadres. but later it was reported in the newspaper that most of them deserted their workplace and rejoined their old profession and many of them as alleged, even fled away with firearms provided to them by the state. perhaps it was not proper to appoint them in armed cadres and hand over any arms to them.
saifur rahman's passing
saifur rahman was one of the top accounting professionals brought to the political arena by the late president ziaur rahman. president zia vowed to make politics difficult for politicians. induction of non-political persons was one of the tools used to achieve this goal. the results were far from positive. most of such inductees proved themselves to be highly corrupt, maybe slightly smarter than the grassroots politicians.
investors
some investors from abroad who can not arrive in due time at home face a problem regarding their investment in sanchaypatra because the rule is this that you must renew the sanchayptra on the date when it expires its maturity and if not renewed then onwards there will be no interest paid on the instrument, even for years. thus the investor faces a huge loss of interest on their investment in this sector. on the other hand, at home thousands face the problem when they forget to remember the date and make time to go for the renew. the authorities should re-think about this and make arrangement to have the option of auto-renewal system which now prevails in all banking sector in the case of fdr where the fdr is automatically renewed when it expires at present rate of interest.
banned drugs
recently quite a few children have lost their lives after taking paracetamol products. such drugs have been banned by the government. the people in rural areas might be illiterate and may not have access to tv or radio and thus be unaware of the ban, but what about the doctors who are still prescribing these banned medicines?
ramadan and our duties
the ds “ lifestyle” section of 01 sept had a very commendable list of what we all could do, this and indeed, every ramadan. i would slightly disagree on only one action. “giving an umbrella to the traffic controllers, who spend a lot of gruelling time in sun and rain directing traffic”.
thirty years of bnp
there is a popular saying in bengali “jonmo houk jotha totha kormo houk bhalo” which could have been said about the bnp, the party which ran the country for 15 years. for a thirty years old party its nothing but the story of sheer success.
