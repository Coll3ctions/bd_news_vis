trial of war criminals

stop admission business
majority of the population of our country live under poverty line and cannot meet the basic need like education due to their economic insolvency. needless to say, education is a prime requisite for any kind of national development and progress. reasonably, the incumbent government since its assumption of office is showing keen interest in educating the students with proper knowledge of morality, patriotism, communication technology, that the new national education policy serves. due to emphasis on the sector, pass rate of the students in the ssc and the hsc examinations over the past years has significantly increased. consequently, the number of students seeking admission for higher education in different universities and colleges is already higher than the prevailing admission capacity of universities and colleges and is increasing rapidly day by day. as the existing public universities accommodate only a small number from the massive number of admission seekers and many for lack of their economic solvency cannot afford the exorbitant costs of higher education in the private universities, it categorically paves the way for higher education of the richer section of society.

well done, honourable pm!
it is quite pleasing to see the qualitative changes that the present government has brought under the leadership of sheikh hasina in the last one year. her role in climate change dialogue, improving the economic and political relationship with india and china - the two big world's power-, defusing tensions with myanmar and her government's persistent efforts to improve the infrastructure development such as road, gas and electricity in lifting economic condition of the country certainly deserves much appreciation. the schemes to improve the traffic congestion and rivers around dhaka city, rehabilitating beggars through employment creation, curbing the politics of militants, trial of war criminals and a corruption free cabinet are some of the notable achievements of the present government. the county will grow and reach the level of middle-income countries sooner than expected if our governments continue performing like this. i would urge the people to support the government and give them the credit for their genuine efforts to improve the condition of bangladesh, as everybody expects recognition of his or her good work. this should also be a lesson for others who are willing to lead the country in future as the true and patriot leaders act to improve the fate of common people, not of themselves. also, no minister has the courage to engage in corruption if the leader does not endorse it.
gulshan park

dhaka's descent into disaster
dhaka, the old moghul capital, has become a modern day disaster. the years of inefficiency and neglect on the part of successive administrations have truly turned this once peaceful, beautiful city into the "second-worst" liveable city in the world. i wonder what the city mayor, gazing at the dhaka skyline from his imposing office, will make out of this dubious distinction dhaka has earned.
equity in development
if development is defined as a multidimensional process of change from a less desirable to a more socially desirable state, then orthodox and critical alternate perspective of development comes into play (caroline thomas and melvyn reader-1997). the orthodox view of development encourages the south to replicate more or less walt rostow's "stages of economic development" while critical alternate perspective argue for a more holistic approach that would meet the physical, environmental and spiritual needs of human beings.
