pm's salvo at criticism
to the nation's disappointment, prime minister sheikh hasina appears to have dismissed demands from her party and ruling alliance lawmakers that she sack some under-performing ministers. the lawmakers were only giving expression to widespread public feeling about some critical issues the nation has of late been facing. by her reaction, the prime minister has made it clear that while she relishes the good words about her government she is in little mood to accept and act on justified criticism. in this case, the criticism was not so much directed at her as it was at some ministers. by choosing to criticise the critics, she has effectively given a boost to those ministers who have performed miserably. worse, she gives people reason to suspect that intolerance may be blinding the government to the realities on the ground.

let's all live in harmony
the indigenous communities are demanding to implement the chittagong hill tracts peace accord in full, signed in the previous tenure of awami league government in 1997. it is palpable that the government's failure is the main reason behind the misunderstanding among factions of indigenous people. why is the government now creating a debate unnecessarily over “tribal or indigenous”? we have heard that according to the ilo convention 169, there are no major differences between them in terms of providing facilities.
greenhouse effect
greenhouse gases are the components of the atmosphere that contribute to the greenhouse effect. the major greenhouse gases are- carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons etc. it is clear that the greenhouse effect is a great threat to the world.
painful road accidents
one more accident took away the lives of renowned filmmaker tareque masud and a media personality ashfaque munier mishuk. road accident happens very often in bangladesh most of which go unpublished and thus none knows about them. how long shall we endure such pathetic happenings? today we are feeling sorry as we have lost culturally important personalities. otherwise, we pay very little attention to road accidents. people are dying every day on roads. a few days ago people of bangladesh witnessed mirsarai tragedy in chittagong. after the deaths of tareque masud and ashfaque munier mishuk, several other accidents occurred in the country. the government cannot sit idle. a comprehensive traffic control system with its full utilization is the demand of people. i think reckless driving, faulty designs and poor maintenance of roads and weak enforcement of traffic rules are the major causes of frequent accidents on highways that claim scores of lives every year. experts said number of traffic accidents could be reduced considerably if speed limits were strictly enforced. it is high time we took steps and joined the campaign against road accident.
alternative to physical punishment
while i was a student of notre dame college, i got acquainted with a philosophy of the notre dame family. it was, they did not believe in physical punishment which creates unwanted distance and malice between the teacher and the students. what then the notre dame college teachers did to punish the guilty? if any student was found absent-minded or undisciplined, teachers gave him more assignments than the other students. doing all the problems of math exercise, writing all the principles of a physics chapter ten times or drawing a number of graphs was among the punishments. if anyone neglected his assignments, he was given twice more assignments. on further negligence his results would be withheld and his guardians took his responsibility. this not only made us disciplined but also increased our efficiency. we became more sincere considering the burden of a large number of assignments. i request the education ministry to take this into consideration instead of physical punishment.
the chariot of civilization
a particular civilization has its own life span. when i see london burning and its youth looting, i hear the death knell of western civilization. the chariot of civilization seems to be leaving west for another location that may be middle east where the youth brought down two autocratic governments with little arson and bloodbath. when a civilization lapse into sectarian and seek one-eyed interest of the powerful, it ceases to be a civilization. when the civilization degenerates into merely material gain rather than the mental illumination, the hydra head of darkness rise to engulf that civilization. when a civilization wage unjust war and kill millions of innocent people just for establishing the hegemony of hubris, the horse of civilization looses its patience and start for new destination. we strongly believe that the camel of civilization will stop at our door step if we welcome it with bouquets of universal and non-sectarian flowers and music. great minds have no religion and great civilization is as general as nature which equally nurtures all people all over the world.
road accidents and traffic laws
i would say these are not anymore accidents, these are murders. before anything the traffic law needs to be very strong like those are being implemented in the first world countries. in our neighbouring country india,we have noticed that mr. anna hazari is on hunger strike against corruption. is there anyone or any group in our country who is conscious about traffic law? can they not go to shaheed minar and do some decent protest/hunger strike against these unexpected deaths in our country. can't they force the government to make and implement strong traffic laws?
mindset of our leaders!
how degradingly low could be the mindset of our political leaders? it was indeed really shocking and embarrassing to see the picture of our opposition leader alongside party loyal in the ds, cutting happily a 67 lb cake, in the early hours of 15th aug, just next to the images of the thousand mourners paying last respect to tareque masud and mishuk muneir. not only for the sake of respect for the father of the nation's death anniversary, but also for the tragic accident, couldn't she postpone or rather cancel her birthday celebration? why is it so important for her and her party to celebrate aug 15 in this manner? what message does it send to the mass people, other than that our leader is indifferent to other people's sentiments?
road safety
in recent times we have witnessed some of the most tragic road accidents. these accidents have taken away the lives of students, intellectuals, government officials and of many men, women and children. according to the government, from the year 1999 to 2010, nearly fifty thousand road accidents have taken place in bangladesh. the sheer bulk of the number is frightening.
the two issues
this refers to the two issues which deserve attention of the media the election manifestoes of the political parties and the information regarding the candidates, their assets and antecedents, notably the criminal past, if any made available in the affidavits, filed by them. the two issues, which get a low priority, are clearly seen as falling in the substantive category.
