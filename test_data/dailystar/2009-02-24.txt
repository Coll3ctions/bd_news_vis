making parliament vibrant and effective
it is too early to say anything conclusive about the performance of the ninth parliament, barely 45 days old, though some of the initial signs and symptoms are rather discouraging as the bnp has been absent in the house for 17 days over a meaningless seating arrangement row. it seems jamiruddin sircar, the immediate past speaker who stretched his imagination to introduce the new seating plan, actually laid a trap, which the ruling al has walked into. the whole seating arrangement dispute sounds childish and amateurish, to say the least.
jmb regrouping
the recent arrests of a dozen of jmb militants and discovery of arms and explosives from their hideouts are to be taken as signs of something ominous lurking in the shadows. in fact, seizure of sophisticated explosives, grenade making materials, cds, jihadi books along with the information that they have been living in rented houses indicate that the militants have a regular funding source to sustain their operations across the country. a front-page report in this daily on monday suggests that some of their sympathisers living in the middle east are allegedly sending money through various illegal channels to jmb operatives. some local ngos have also come under suspicion for providing financial help to them.

no matter what former and present police officials may say in defence of the force's actions, integrity, dutifulness, communication skill, professional competence, training standards, personal commitment, inter-personal relationship, personal and professional honesty and so on, public perception continues to be something they must worry about. a great deal needs to be done to improve the image of the police and thereby earn the respect of the common people.
was not 1/11 a historical necessity?
history has to reserve a place for ex-president, dr. iajuddin ahmed for all he did at the end of the bnp-jamaat regime. would it be one of a hero, or a villain? strangely, it should be of both. his caricature, until 1/11, of a president-turned chief adviser of the caretaker government was understandably prompted by bnp's string-pulling from behind the scene. if that was not villainy, then what was?
smart governance
the current government has come to power with the catchphrase of "digital bangladesh." however, to be frank, common people are not that conversant with this term. public services will not reach the doorsteps of the ones who need them most unless they are made easily accessible and obtainable. increased use of ict can greatly facilitate government initiatives to make the administration citizen-friendly. view the page sports
