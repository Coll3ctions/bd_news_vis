the principal difference between an "off the record" and "on the record" conversation with a politician is that the former is likely to be much closer to the truth. off-the-record does not mean outside-the-discourse; after all, the best way to keep anything to yourself is to remain silent. when a politician chooses to talk without attribution, it only means he, or indeed she, is sending a message with an in-built denial clause. off-the-record is a means of placing frustration and anger into public play. this is par for the course, and far more fun than the carefully chosen phrases of official fudge.

a spoon full of love
during the recent holiday season my social life suddenly erupted into an unusual explosion of activities. excuses for entertainment ranged from baby showers, weddings, anniversaries and birthdays. amidst all the dinners and lunches i attended, the one that stood out as a truly epicurean experience was the party organised by my friend to celebrate her husband's retirement. my friend's gastronomic creations are renowned for their exquisite taste, natural ingredients, and stylish presentation. be it beef stroganoff, chicken tikka massala or vegetable frittata, the sauces and flavours of the dishes she cooks are distinctively different -- yet they seem to preserve the character of the originals. the amazing thing is that my friend can make the process of putting together a gourmet meal seem like an effortless exercise. despite a hard day's labour in the kitchen, she manages to greet her guests with a glowing smile looking more fresh and manicured than the invitees!
