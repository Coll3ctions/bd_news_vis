a glaring instance of governance deficit
none other than the chairman, bangladesh road transport authority (brta) has disclosed that 50 percent of the driving licences carried by motor drivers across the country are fake. what is more startling is the admission that those bogus licences were not issued by brta. who were they issued by, then? pat came the reply, albeit without any action plan to remedy the situation: the manufacturing racket is not all a private sector affair, a section of staff in brta and the ministry of communications are involved in the counterfeit licensing business.

meet the marginal man

sa's chance at hand
it will be almost impossible for the boxing day test to live up to the drama of south africa's win in perth. so unexpected was their brilliant chase of 414 that it left both teams in a state of shock. the squads have had a few days to digest the outcome and for australia the distaste of losing forced at least one player to be spat out. but it will take more than just personnel alterations for ricky ponting's men to fight back in melbourne when the second test begins here today. they face the challenge of turning a moderate attack into one capable of curbing south africa's powerful batting line-up, while their own batsmen try to click back into gear.

nz, wi change gear
after no results in a drawn two-match test series, it's understandable that both new zealand and west indies would be desperate to slip into a new format with hopes of notching up a result. while neither side has really been comfortable in test cricket this year, it might be stretching it to say they're more comfortable in twenty20.
ricky hopes for best
as ricky ponting's toughest year in charge of the australian team draws to a close he is facing one of the test matches that could define his captaincy. a loss to south africa in melbourne this week would concede the series and cap off a disappointing year that began with a narrow but controversial series win against india at home and continued with a 2-0 loss in india.

we never gave up: dyson
west indies coach john dyson has said his team deserves credit for pushing new zealand in an evenly-contested draw in the final test of the two-match series. a series of convincing individual performances ensured an outright result was never in prospect in the decider, but dyson said earning a draw was "better than losing".

irresponsible utterances
during this vigorous election campaigns all politicians, particularly the top ones, must mind their utterances in public meetings and in front of the media. irresponsible comments may cost them votes and change public perceptions. they should not take the people for granted. they cannot fool them with their lies, false and impractical promises.
false promises?
recently, our two major political parties have unveiled their election manifestoes with a view to enlisting people's support in favour of their candidates in the coming elections. the awami league, one of the major parties, has branded its manifesto as 'charter for change'. it has addressed nearly all substantive issues like lowering of commodity prices, curbing of corruption, raising production of power (5000 megawatt power by 2011), free education up to degree level, permanent pay commission, trial of war criminals, eradication of poverty and inequality and establishment of good governance. also a bright future to the new generation has been pledged in the manifesto called 'vision 2021'.the manifesto contains both short term and long-term programmes. on the other hand, the other major party --bangladesh nationalist party (bnp)-- vowed to provide employment and medical facilities including health insurance and reduce prices of essentials. over the past decades, we have seen that during election our politicians made many tall promises to the people and after their victory they forgot everything. it has become one of the salient features of our political tradition!
words only?
someone said, ''we are a nation of words only.” now if we look at the situation ahead of the parliamentary elections, we have to admit that the statement is true.

election & hartal
we are once again going to have a national election and once again we are terrified at the prospect of incoming hartals which both the major parties are expert in using to punish the nation.
to president bush…
iraqi journalist zeidi offered you a golden opportunity to tell the world that you possess at least some virtues. you are probably the most hated man in the world right now. what zeidi has expressed by his act of throwing his shoes at you is the feeling of millions of people around the globe. you can realize that. the security police in iraq can torture zeidi; they have broken his arms and ribs, but they will not be able to break his spirit. you could have immediately stopped this, by forgiving him, by acknowledging that lot of people do hate you for the deeds you thought to be for a right cause. when a demonstrator was caught after throwing an egg at the british prime minister harold wilson, the great man forgave him and suggested that he join the british army as he possessed such a good aim at the target.
christmas
there we find the virgin mother offering the baby jesus - the one who stripped himself of divine glory in order to become poor, driven by love for mankind.
national holidays
we have enough of national holidays along with hartals which are unwarranted national holidays for which we citizens did not bargain for in our constitution. it is good that we have got rid of innumerable national holidays which we used to enjoy in our childhood in memory of our great leaders. i do not still understand why we used to have those holidays when those great leaders worked hard for the whole of their lives to deliver us a better life. although i do not think economic freedom of a nation is everything, yet it is required to guarantee safeguard of other freedoms to some extent. i do not find any justification behind such long national holidays for eids and pujas. in europe and america where the countries are developed and can afford to take their pace slowing down and where the muslims form in many countries well over 10% of the population, we do not see eids as national holidays.
allow fema to monitor elections
it is unacceptable that the election commission has disallowed fema, the most experienced organisation doing election monitoring since 1995, to monitor the elections. people know fema since 1996. thousands of citizens across the country are involved with this organisation as volunteer activists and especially during the election time as election observers. their reports are neutral and acceptable.

"some of the families whom we help give us 50 taka, some 100 taka and some give us nothing at all, but, if we shake our heads and say that there are such complications that they must go to the clinic, the clinic gives us 500 taka! sister, what do we do? we have families to bring up." view the page international
