contemptible!
one would have thought what marked out a living organism from an inanimate object is the capacity for feeling. the marker ought to be nobler when you are a human being. you are simply expected to sense the pain and trauma of another who has been physically hurt with the same intensity as though you were the victim. should you fail the test, you don't simply deserve to be called a human being. not even perhaps an animal; as even some species exude kindness to the kindred. view the page sports

some suggestions
i would like to suggest the following to the policy makers of our government.
save jatka
day by day we are losing our national fish hilsa, because fishermen are catching hilsa fry (jatka) defying the law. hilsa has a great contribution to our gdp. according to sources, in our national gdp its contribution is 1%. so, it is a matter we should give importance to.
rising sea level
the rivers that drain into bangladesh deposit more than 500 million tonnes of sediment each year. many islands do disappear but new ones emerge. in fact, more land is gained than lost. in this context, the formation of a single island in the 1970s and its disappearance 30 or so years later are not remarkable and do not have any implications with respect to the supposedly catastrophic effects of carbon dioxide emissions.
we can win
we have got a clear message from the students of o and a levels in 2008-2009 academic sessions that bangladeshi students also can win the world. we feel our exuberance in offering accolades to those 52 students who have got world's highest marks in various subjects in those sessions (highest marks were secured before also). their marvellous achievements speak for the talent of bangladeshi students even amid various constraints and shortage of facilities. surely, we have this sort of talented students in our general education also.
stop jay walking
at about 9.30 a.m. in the morning, i was waiting at a traffic signal in front of alliance franchise keeping close to the maiden to take a u turn. suddenly, there was a knock on the window, turning around i saw a girl in uniform yelling at me. being unable to hear anything i lowered the window and i was shocked to hear what she had to say. i politely asked her, was she walking on the footpath that i have to make way for her to pass. i was even more shocked to hear her reply. she said it is for the students of dhaka city college.
road accidents
for our daily activities or for journey, we have to ride bus, car, taxi etc but the question is how safe these vehicles are for us to ride in! abnormal road accident has almost become a normal matter to us. as a result, every day road accident is increasing.
crime situation
lately, the number of crimes has been on the rise in dhaka city. every day we are getting news of killing & stabbing from various parts of dhaka. crime is also increasing in other regions of the country. if we peruse the newspapers of last ten or fifteen days, we would find news of killing & violence every day. some of those news reports even found place in the first pages of top newspapers. it is true that we cannot blame the government for those crimes but methinks it should activate its law enforcing agencies. it must be proactive, rather than reactive to reduce those criminal activities. we want to live with safety & security.
business education
from the time of alexander, the idea of globalisation has been a much-talked about topic in the intellectual world-- especially in the field of political economy and in the socio-cultural arena. it became a reality after travelling a long path, finally in the 20th century. we are now living in a global environment. technological development makes the flow of information very easy and we have easy access to it. almost all the spheres of our society are affected by this surge requiring various kinds of reforms and adjustments with numerous dimensions. people's attitudes are changing as they become more and more aware of the international events and their consequences. economic adjustments coupled with changing business environment made it mandatory to have required knowledge in the field of business and commerce. multi-national corporations are expanding their operation much faster than before in the developing countries as they are trying to become cost effective. skilled and knowledge oriented labour force are the basic requirement to grab those opportunities. we have to compete with other nations if we are willing to capitalize on those opportunities which require extensive education and knowledge in the relevant fields. business education, which we are acquiring, will help us to cope with this environment. we need to develop our learning from both theoretical and practical context. we must be dynamic and confident by acquiring knowledge of various fields. interactive, analytical, on-line supporting paper works as well as diffusion of knowledge among the students, intensive group discussion on various real life events, workshop, and debate etc. can increase our decision making power and analytical ability. therefore, it is high time for the students not to spoil their time engaging in unproductive activities but to be more and more engrossed in the study, so that they can shine and compete successfully in the professional fields. one of us may get a nobel prize for our hard work. it is difficult but not impossible.
lu campus
leading university (lu) campus is situated in sylhet city, a region highly vulnerable to earthquake. the present campus of lu is located in a very old building, modhuban market, where more than 1800 students study.
an apologetic pakistani
i was absolutely delighted when i was going through the write-up of eminent pakistani journalist hamid mir entitled “apology day for pakistani” in the daily star on march 26. in his writing, hamid has demanded formal apology from the government of pakistan to the people of bangladesh for the war crimes committed by their forefathers back in 1971. symbolically, hamid's awareness seems to me the awareness of pakistanis, majority of whom feel ashamed and sorry for the genocide imposed on us by the oppressive military rulers during our liberation war.
divided nation
in 2010 the nation is divided into two political groups. the practice of democracy is being thwarted by the crude power politics. the mass people have become puppets at the hands of two political parties. it is evident that the top leaders of our two prime political parties always fail to reach a consensus on our major national issues such as health care, education, sovereignty, foreign policy etc. the most worrying fact is that the country's sovereignty is being undermined by some inconsiderate alliances with the external powers. in our country the total policy changes with the change of government. consequently, poverty and unemployment persist. due to the conflicts between the two parties, the major issues always remain unresolved.
nuclear iran
iran should acquire or develop nuclear weapon as soon as possible to ensure its survival against any western or israeli military invasion. look, just before the last iraq invasion, the western powers first misled the whole world by spreading baseless news about iraqi wmd. they were in such a hurry to attack iraq that they did not wait for the opinion of the world community. in fact major western intelligences were very well aware that iraq did not possess any wmd!
mosquitoes
the population of khulna city is increasing day by day. that's why civic problems are also increasing. infestation of mosquito is one of them. in our city this problem is becoming a normal one. it is impossible to sit at the reading room, drawing room, kitchen or anywhere without being bitten by mosquitoes at night. this problem has become so acute that even during daytime mosquitoes reign supreme.
contaminated water
in shantinagar area, we are getting contaminated water supplied by wasa. the water we use is full of termite and there is bad odour in the water as well. we can't use this water for cooking and for bathing.
dst and we
last year when daylight saving was introduced, people did not oppose it, most people accepted it. they adjusted to the changed situation.
counterfeit items
although i believe articles on this matter have been published in newspapers before, i would still like to bring to your attention that despite this, a well known departmental store chain continues to sell counterfeit items such as 'kellog's cornflakes'. any prudent consumer would be able to detect the difference between the authentic kellog's cornflakes cartons manufactured in manchester, u.k. and those counterfeit items. other small departmental stores in dhanmondi are also selling these items. i must admit i was really annoyed by the indifference of the sales personnel when i approached them on the matter. they were obviously embarrassed when i approached them and were insistent on taking me aside so that the other customers wouldn't overhear. if they really care about their reputation they should stop the sale of counterfeit items and help bring the people responsible to justice! view the page international
