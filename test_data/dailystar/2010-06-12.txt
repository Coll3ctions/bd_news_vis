challenges facing the budget
it cannot be said that the national budget for the next fiscal year (fy 2010-2011) at around tk132.17 billion, which is 16.9 per cent of the proposed gross domestic product (gdp) worth tk 780.29 billion, is too ambitious given the overall size of the economy and the population. and compared to the revised budget for the outgoing fiscal (2009-10), it is only 35 per cent higher. from considerations of novelty, there is, however, not much to write home about except that it is a continuation of the earlier budget in terms of the emphasis given on human resources development, agriculture, power and energy and rural development. however, with extra thrust on infrastructures like power and energy on which the proposed allocation has been increased by 61.5 per cent, the new budget promises to facilitate investment better than before.

biodiversity for life and livelihood
human being is probably the most intelligent among the million species. he has tamed the nature by his knowledge and comparative physical advantages. however, in his reckless consumption spree for the sake of development and prosperity, humans have used different species in such a way that many of those have already become extinct and some others are under threat of extinction.
saving biodiversity, managing ecosystems
whatever the religious scriptures depict, man as a species of living beings constitutes a negligible part of the earth's biota. yet, having overwhelming intelligence and capacity to mould nature, he has done much harm to the environment that nurtures all of them with motherly affection. in essence, we -- the humans -- have been a destructive species that has caused irreparable damage to mother nature just for rapid production of our utilities and to lead an easier and rather lavish life. view the page literature
che and i
as i was driving to work, i heard on the radio that che, the legendary revolutionary, was visiting my hometown this coming friday. my first reaction was to dismiss the announcement as a prank. by the time i reached the expressway, i was convinced that it was a case of bad radio reception since i was driving though some dead zones of which there are plenty in the suburbs where i live. however, after i reached my office, curiosity overwhelmed my better judgment, and i checked on the internet and found that che was indeed coming to my town.
tears hard to hold back
it is not every day that one sees a funeral procession of a police officer who died in the line of duty. i witnessed such a one, one of the most serious and spectacular processions that i have ever seen, a few days ago. in a civilized society, it is the police officers who safeguard law and order and keep things flowing. it is also the police that prevent crime. without them society will be in chaos. a police officer, a nurse, a sweatshop factory worker, a city sanitary worker, a fireman, a postal worker, a farmer who grows things for us; they are the backbone of any society. they are the everyday heroes who we do not give a moment's thought. some of them earn less than a dollar a day.
memories of a father
when the sky turns crimson in the west even as the day ends, i remember my father. it has been more than fourteen years since i last had any conversation with him. there will be years, a myriad of them, when he and i will not have occasion to speak to each other again. he has been dead all these years and sleeps in the shadow of pastoral trees through which the winds blow and the rains pour. view the page strategic issues
japan-us relations poised to strengthen

barisal by the bay
the following review was published almost three years back, a year after fakrul alam's book of translations of jibanananda das's poems came out. amazingly (for a book of translated poems, that is) that first edition sold out, and a second edition - with a smaller, more pleasing font, with the addition of some more translated poems like knowing how these fields will not be hushed that day and i stay in the city all the time, and with a few poems reworded, as in life's transactions have closed again now is life's mart has closed again - is now out. all of which merits a reprint of the original review, specially for those readers who missed it on the first go-around.
of commonplace situations and recognisable characters
chitra divakaruni's first volume of short stories, arranged marriage, was so good that when my eyes alighted upon another such collection, the lives of strangers, in a bookshop, i had to buy it just then.
peregrinations in the world of faith
god has always been elusive. or the search for him has been. then too there are all the instances where looking for god, putatively finding him and then claiming him for a particular religious community has spawned issues over which vast global regions have become involved. witness the aftermath of 11 september 2001 in the united states. suddenly, because of the destruction in new york, western interest in islam as also its fears of it have become a considerable many degrees more pronounced. karen armstrong, happily for us, is not guided by these immediate considerations. for a basic reason, which is that she has for a very long time been writing on religion and has particularly remained busty expostulating the diverse aspects of the islamic faith. reasoned analyses have been part of her assessments of the place of faith in life.
