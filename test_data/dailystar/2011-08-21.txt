al lawmakers' outburst
the impassioned manner in which ruling awami league lawmakers have raised questions of public sufferings and grilled ministers in the jatiyo sangsad in recent days is certainly welcome and clearly a matter of relief for the nation. that they have finally begun to focus on such issues nearly three years into their term as parliamentarians is appreciable, though one is tempted to ask why they desisted from doing the same till now. the mps' ire at the patent inability of the government to handle such issues as roads, power, prices of essentials, et cetera, is a clear sign of desperation on their part. in the face of mounting criticism of the government's failure to satisfy public expectations, the lawmakers have found it extremely difficult to face their constituents. they have acknowledged as much, which obviously reflects on the government and raises a number of questions regarding governance or the lack of it. the mps' sentiments are also, sadly, an indication of the growing chasm between them and ministers content to mouth platitudes at every opportunity.

london riots
london and other english cities are in turmoil. with the current coalition government where no one has a definite say, riots were at the top of things to happen. the main cause for these riots, which were caused mainly by the young underclass of english society, is that there are talks of rights but lack of responsibility. the current conservative government seems as if it doesn't want uk youth to be educated anymore. is £9,000 an appropriate amount for a year's worth of university education? or, what about the budget cuts that benefits the upper class of society but destroy the underclass? cameron's 'big society' in which everyone helps everyone is certainly at an all-time low. some people need to control their children whereas a certain person needs to take control of the country.
passenger's role in reducing accident
we know many factors are responsible for road accidents. unskilled and whimsical driving, transport's unfitness and bad road conditions etc. might be the most prominent factors. however, as these problems solving agencies are beyond passenger's reach instantly but they are the most victim group of accidents, so they, the passengers onboard, should come forward for playing an important role in this regard.
food adulteration goes unabated
as per recent reports 70-90% food items of our country are adulterated. it is sad news for the whole nation. probably we will not find any country in the world like ours. adulteration has been happening for many years but of late it has crossed the limit, posing serious health hazards to the people. it has the worst impact on our children's mental and physical growth and women's fertility. food adulteration causes cancer and damages vital human organs like liver, kidney and heart. it is the result of greed of a handful of dishonest businessmen. they must be dealt with rigorous punishment; otherwise, the health of the whole nation will be jeopardized soon.
fading glory of govt. colleges
government colleges have not been on the list of best colleges for the last few years. it is because they are plagued with multifarious problems such as lack of teachers, dirty politics, absence of easy new subjects like computer and islamic studies, poor monitoring and corruption. there are many government colleges where only one teacher is to run the whole department single-handedly juggling between office works and giving a few classes that is humanly possible out of several classes everyday. naturally most often students get no classes as a result they recourse to private tutors and coaching centers. so government college classes remain almost empty that too often get disturbed or closed by wrangling and violence between rival groups and college administration itself. this sorry state is there for long. the repeated application for creating new posts and opening new subjects often gets no nod from the concerned ministries. on the other hand, college administrations get discouraged to do development works in the colleges because of racketeering by the student leaders backed up by the local mps. only political commitment and proper monitoring and attracting good ones to teaching professions can turn the sorry state of the government colleges around.
let catherine carry on
the unnatural death of the two prodigies, one prominent filmmaker tareque masud and another eminent media personality mishuk munier, is an irreparable loss for our film industry and electronic media. this happened due to lack of responsibility of the drivers and poor state of the roads. tareque masud's films muktir gaan (1995) and matir moina (2002) have achieved international awards and also represented us to the whole world. all of us had expected that he would be more renowned for his next film kagojer ful (the paper flower) but our dream is shattered with the dreadful road accident. i hope that catherine masud would complete the remaining work of the film kagojer ful to fulfill the dream of tareque masud.

life is priceless
road accidents have become perpetual lead news in bangladesh. every day we get the horrific news of road mishaps in the print and electronic media. many valuable lives are lost in these road accidents. actually, the highways have become death traps in our country and road accidents are occurring frequently on these highways. reckless driving, overtaking, overloading, defective vehicles and dilapidated roads are mainly responsible for road accidents. we all should raise our voice to curb these accidents. the government should take pragmatic and effective measures to check road accidents. traffic police as well as highway police can play a pivotal role here. the commuters should be more aware in this regard. they should not travel on the roof of the vehicles and incite the drivers to overtake other vehicles on the highways. those who own private cars should be strict with their drivers. we all should keep in mind that life is more valuable than time.
the underage drivers
it seems that the country especially dhaka is having the most under aged drivers who do not have license but they are driving tempos and human haulers. other than this they also drive mini buses and pickups when need arises. this is not only in dhaka but also in other districts. they are doing it by managing the traffic police and the sergeants. as a result the road accidents are increasing tremendously in the city. we the concerned citizen of the country ask the police department to check these and take stern measures against all these drivers. it is also alleged that these drivers who did not even cross the age of 15 confidently tell that age does not count in this profession. it is the money that matters and we have given some money and got fake license. they say that the owner gives them permission to drive the mini buses if the driver does not show up. we vehemently ask the police to check this practice and stop these teenagers to drive these vehicles which is dangerous for the people who travel by these buses.
