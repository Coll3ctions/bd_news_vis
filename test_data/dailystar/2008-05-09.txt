energy plan
recently, the chinese foreign minister visited bangladesh and showed interest in making a nuclear power plant that would provide electricity. bangladesh should take this seriously and be quick to respond to this opportunity. the only ingredients involved in making nuclear powered electricity are water and uranium. it is very cheap, it costs only two cents to produce one kilowatt of electricity. it is environmentally friendly. the initial cost is a bit high, but if we invest a few billions of dollars it will be worth it in the long run. it can run continually for thirty years before renovation is needed. there are some people who spread rumours that nuclear energy is "dangerous" without knowing the facts. everybody knows that the nuclear power accident that happened 22 years ago (1986) at chernobyl was due to a human error. nuclear plants always need proper maintenance. developed countries have been using nuclear electricity for more than half a century. electricity is the key power for all industrial development. bangladesh should immediately start developing at least 5,000 megawatt capacity power plants.

rickshaws in the capital

imf's diktats
a recent article by bill quigley ( a human rights lawyer and law professor at loyola university, new orleans) titled “ the us role in haiti's food riots”, published in one of our english dailies, was one glaring example of how multilateral organisations such as imf, under the auspices of the us, damaged haiti's agricultural market. according to the author, in 1986 (after the removal of “baby doc” duvalier), the imf gave loan of $24.6m loan to haiti. but as always they set certain preconditions i.e. haiti was asked to remove tariff barriers from their rice and other agricultural products so that cheap and “subsidized” us rice could enter into their domestic market. and as a result, the haitian farmers found it very difficult to compete against cheap us rice. thus domestic farmers were adversely affected and lost the incentive to cultivate any further. there were other repercussions in the form of “rice wars”, and to make matters worse lives were lost.
