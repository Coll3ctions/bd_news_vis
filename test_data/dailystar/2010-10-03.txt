ayodhya verdict

good news for cepz
we are certainly pleased that the chittagong epz has been given a high ranking by the uk-based journal fdi. that despite all our problems, multifarious in nature, the cepz has been recognised in a survey of 700 economic zones as the fourth best in terms of economic potential and third best in the competitive category is certainly a moral boost for us. and indeed we do think that such a placing of the cepz can well be taken as a sign of the long way our investment-related activities can go. more importantly, though, we believe that the ranking should act as a spur to us in the matter of streamlining things on the national economic scene through injecting more vitality into other economic zones in the country. view the page sports

hydraulic horn
hydraulic horns are banned by law in our country. but i am a bit sceptical if there is any implementation of the ban. on the city roads i used to hear the high-powered hoots of the hydraulic horns, especially in the trucks after dusk.
electronic admission process
this year different universities have taken an excellent initiative about undergraduate admission. dhaka university and many other engineering universities have introduced an electronic system for filling up admission forms and the payment of fees. using the internet and the state-owned teletalk connection, an admission seeker can easily apply for admission to any of these universities sitting at home. no more travelling for hours to get to the university, no more standing in queues and no more hassle in submitting the form and other necessary papers! an efficient way to save papers, and, of course, time. this system has been developed by the teachers of shahjalal university of science & technology, sylhet, and this project has rightly earned itself the national e-content award. we also appreciate this innovation. but this achievement has also put the government face to face with some new challenges. access to internet has to be ensured. as the payment has to be made only by using a teletalk connection, many will have to go to shops or mobile phone booths to pay the fees. the charge for providing this service should be minimal and it should be the same all over the country.
set up new gas pipelines
on september 10th, i, along with two of my friends, was walking through s.m. maleh road at narayanganj in the morning. suddenly, we got a smell of natural gas. after a while, we discovered that it was coming out of the drain beside the road. within an hour, we found the same condition in kutipara road, nayamati road and loyal tank road. it was the day before eid, so we were just wondering what would happen if anybody would throw a burning cigarette on the road? our surmise was correct, that at 10.25pm of the same day when we were gossiping on that road, all on a sudden there was something aflame on the road and it was a burning piece of cigarette. the fire spread quickly. after 15-20 minutes, people from local fire service station came and extinguished it.
airport bus service
over the years, i have had the opportunity to travel to many different countries. in all airports i have seen airport bus services for commuters to travel between the airport and different parts of the city. this service was utilised by passengers, airport employees and anyone who wished to go to the airport to receive relatives or for other purposes. the buses were big, air-conditioned and had designated bus stops for them. these buses also had adequate luggage space. as this service was very affordable, many airports or airline employees did not bring their cars to the airport. this reduced a lot of congestion in the airport areas, traffic jams on the airport roads, and people did not have to worry about parking their cars in the expensive and limited airport parking lots.
global competitiveness
bangladesh has again failed to uphold its global business competitiveness index exhibiting a downward trend that reflects country's miserable investment climate. except for a few indicators such as- training and education, and financial market sophistication, most of the indicators show a deteriorating position. for the economic development of the country, it is mandatory to have a congenial business climate where various factors that are relevant to business and commerce are stable and ensured in the most efficient manner. major indicators such as- macro-economic stability, higher education and training, market size, and innovation have not shown any significant improvement, whereas other indicators have either deteriorated or remained somewhat stable at a lower level. but the major blow was infrastructure that has shown a significant downward trend. infrastructure is the most important element for the economic development of a country. but it is a matter of great regret that our infrastructure facilities have been rather downgraded over time than to have shown any sustainable, better outlook. transportation system remains inefficient. there has been a huge power shortage in the country prevailing for a long time but the authorities concerned have not taken any effective measures yet. we have to keep in mind that trivial improvement is not the solution, as our competitors, like vietnam, indonesia and some other countries, are doing better than us and grabbing all the opportunities. but it shouldn't have happened. we have a huge and cheap labour force along with a sizable demand for goods and services in the country.
a corrupt nation
the other day (september 21, 2010) turning on the television, i happened to see a treasury bench member speaking on the microphone at the national assembly on rights and privileges enjoyed by the mps and the negative attitude of the media towards them. since it sounded interesting, i kept watching btv, which was telecasting live the parliament session. later on, the honourable speaker of parliament took over and began delivering his speech. at one point he mentioned that some car dealers met him with the purpose of supplying cars for the mps and that they would reward him with a sum of tk. 200 crore if a purchase of tk.800 crore is made (not sure about the figure). the honourable speaker, being an honest man, got alarmed and decided to refrain from such a venture and refer the matter to the honourable prime minister. with the honourable speaker's speech at the national assembly, it has now become officially established that this nation is indeed a corrupt nation, irrespective of what the tib says or not. the party in power always denies the tib report on corruption.
coaching centres
have any one of you ever tried to understand what is going on in the name of coaching outside the schools in the so-called english medium schools? i am a poor father of a student of o-level. the teachers of o & a levels in different schools are engaged in coaching outside their schools. two thousand and five hundred bucks a month is the fee for the two-days-a-week service. besides going to their respective schools, many students start to go there for each subject, as soon as they are promoted to grade nine. the prime effort of the coaching centres is to prepare the students for the exams. as a result, having been utterly confused, the parents like me are going from door to door for finding out the right (?) coaching centre. the situation of the students is even worse. from 8 am - 2 pm they stay at schools and after that until 9 pm they stay at the coaching centres. their weekends are also not spared. what a pity that the poor kids are running like a spool in a weaving machine for getting a bigger score in the exams. we, the parents, are indeed responsible for this. it is because of our demand that the coaching centres continue to exist and grow.
good taxpayers
since the taxes paid by the people to the government for development work can be compared to the blood coursing through the veins nourishing the human body, it is commendable that the government has started to recognise the good taxpayers. on the occasion of national income tax day on 15 sep 2010, the finance minister himself distributed crests to as many as 348 taxpayers from all parts of bangladesh. i am surprised that no one from dhaka or chittagong, the dens of iniquity, was named in the ds report.
will we ever improve?
when will we improve? will we ever improve? though i am an eternal optimist, this particular question has me stumped. the character and general behaviour of bangladeshis have a lot to do with both the following issues: a bloody clash between the supporters of the ruling party and bnp took place at the john f kennedy (jfk) international airport in new york in the usa on last sunday wounding at least 10. the clash occurred centring the new york visit of bangladesh prime minister wanting to join the un session. when prime minister arrived at the airport and went inside, the bloody clash took place between the supporters of the two parties outside the airport. the ny police controlled the situation.
match fixing
from the very beginning cricket has been treated as a gentleman game. but that image is now in a threatened position. cricketers sometimes fix the result of a match for huge financial benefits. this is the impact of massive commercialisation of cricket. even the international cricket council (icc) seems to be helpless in this situation.
anthrax hazard
according to the latest report, 589 people have been infected with anthrax so far, since the middle of august. anthrax was first detected in bangladesh on august 20 in sirajganj district. despite measures taken by the local government, the disease spread into six districts of the country.
intolerable!
traffic jam, load shedding and gas crisis have crippled our daily life. these are the main news of almost all the national dailies of the country. the awami league cadres assaulted the government officials in pabna. chhatra league cadres are doing the same around the country.
jfk airport incident
what happened at jfk airport in new york on 19 september 2010 afternoon is very sad. the activists of bnp went there to demonstrate peacefully against prime minister sheikh hasina's totalitarian practices and human rights violations in bangladesh. if they could demonstrate peacefully, i do not think sheikh hasina would be terribly humiliated, because many prime ministers and presidents have to undergo such embarrassing experiences. by attacking the bnp protesters and turning the airport area into a battlefield, those awami league activists dishonoured our beloved country. sheikh hasina was also mortified and had to use a 'safe exit door' to leave the airport.
communicative english
he is right in saying it is amazing what high grades in english tests and examinations can be gained by those who go out into the world tongue-tied when it comes to speaking the language - but then i have come across english ma's of whom the same can be said! however, how hard it would be to find an incorruptible way of testing speaking ability, considering what has happened to writing ability! in many schools, corrupt systems have evolved via memorised questions and answers and even whole essays learnt by heart - never name copying - all enabled by 'helpful' big brothers, sisters, parents and private tutors - and the notorious grammar books and their ilk. such books, and people, enable some students to achieve what they consider their prime aim - how to get a good mark in the next english test, usually by finding a way in which words can flow from the pen to the paper without, at any point, needing to go through the brain. i have even known parents who, in accusing tones, call 'unseen!' any questions in tests that are not identical to the ones that can be memorised from the student's exercise book or, as it is universally, and inaccurately, called here, their 'copy' - an unfortunate reflection on how it is often used. teachers, sadly, are often fully aware of the cheating 'games' that are being played but permit them as if they stand in the way of the short-term aims of such pupils and their parents, complaints may be made to management and they could lose their jobs. thus the failure of firm and fair discipline to purify the system and the attitudes and practices in it perpetuate the mess that schools can get into. giggling and saying, “this is how we do things in bangladesh and we can't do anything about it,” may be factual but it is still an insult. you see, the main problem with english in bangladesh is surely not the lack of people who can speak english but the shortage of people who can write it! many are those who can confidently (but usually inaccurately) chatter away but ask them to write anything down and see them disappear…! view the page international

unanswered questions about the garments wage issue
don't come around today, gondogol' -- the text-message blipped on my phone. garments workers were allegedly going on a rampage in gulshan, protesting the minimum wage award that was announced earlier that week. according to eyewitness accounts, the people attacking the wal-mart office -- a major buyer -- didn't look like a spontaneous mob. there were all sorts of speculations: war criminals were behind this; oh no, it was the indians out to destroy our economy.
living wage is not just wages
every day, when the millions of employees of the several thousand garments factories, hundreds of thousands workers of the several hundred knitwear factories or the several thousands of workers of the few hundred spinning mills head off to work, they are busy thinking of the several daily chores and expenses as is expected of any earning professional in any other company in bangladesh. we all seek earnings for housing, food, education, utilities and some savings for a rainy day. others more fortunate can begin to think of some savings to take care of parents, sharing in some creature comforts and finally, some helping hand to the less fortunate.
made in bangladesh
on a wintry morning in 1978 in my office in chittagong deputy commissioner's house, i meet this maverick former civil servant now turned an entrepreneur asking my help to get his imported garment machinery off loaded from chittagong customs. this was nurul quader, a senior colleague of mine, who had left the service to pursue his talent in the private sector, and had hit upon this rather adventurous concept of making readymade garments following the south korean model. there was some snag in clearing the equipment for the fledgling industry he had set up, which he called desh garments. this was done in no time, but for me the million dollar question to him was why at all he had landed in this adventure when he had scores of other opportunities to try his business acumen.
getting and staying active in later life
old age is neither a disease nor an individual problem; rather, it has become a worldwide challenge that must be addressed globally. "later life" is unavoidable, inevitable, universal and excessively troublesome. no one can stop the process of ageing. the quality of life and the rate of ageing both vary considerably depending on a number of factors such as education, occupation, purchasing capacity, lifestyle, food habit, residential location, belief and culture, etc.
