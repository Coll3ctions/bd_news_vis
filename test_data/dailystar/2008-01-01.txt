goodbye 2007
as we look back to 2007 we do so with a mixed feeling. the pessimists perhaps might say that it could have been better. we would like to suggest that as things turned out for us in bangladesh, it could have been worse.
shocking succession to benazir
the sadness that has weighed upon people's minds following the assassination of benazir bhutto can only deepen with the way her pakistan people's party has decided to elect its new leadership. the bigger truth, though, is that there is really nothing new or inspiring about the new men now in charge of the party. with bilawal bhutto zardari and asif ali zardari taking over as the chairman and co-chairman of the party respectively, it is once more a dominance of dynastic politics rather than democracy that manifests itself. at the same time and in a very regrettable way, it shows up once again the power and influence that pakistan's traditionally feudal society still exercises over the masses. by doing what it has done, the ppp has done little to convince anyone that democracy in pakistan will benefit from the move.
human rights commission and enforcement sensitisation
the news of proposed legislation about the formation of a human rights commission being approved by the advisory council is salutary. the establishment of a commission to specifically look into potential and actual instances of human rights violation is expected to have a preventive and sobering influence on state actors, particularly of the regulatory outfits. one can hope that the enforcement organs that exercise coercive powers will be more than cautious in the discharge of their duties.
the 2008 resolution
one more atrocity by terrorists and an irretrievable loss for pakistan! the great promise that ms. benazir had to offer to this country now remains with us only as frustrated aspirations. benazir's assassination was a tragedy waiting to happen, she knew it and all of us knew it. to carry on regardless in the face of such imminent and terminal danger requires special courage, for which no eulogy can be enough. view the page sports
