she had jaundice. really. so everything looked yellow to her. the streaks of grey in his hair, his intelligent eyes, his well-clipped, clean nails, everything. and he--he had a new strain of viral fever. so her curly hair, pale cheeks and the tiny black bindi on her forehead was all grey to him. sitting in that room in the lodge in gandhi nagar, she actually thought that he was a yellow man; he thought she was a grey woman. poor things. nothing more than a woman and a man, at that moment. she was thirty-five, plus or minus. he, forty-five, plus or minus. she, a divorcee and the mother of two. he, married, the father of two.
proud mary keep on rolling, rolling, rolling...
writers.ink keeps on rolling! it has brought out yet another anthology of short stories by women writers, edited by niaz zaman. the 20 stories in the volume are by both indian and bangladeshi authors. it contains translations and original writing in english, with the majority of the fiction afforded here being very much in the former category. eleven contributions are by bangladeshi women (with three, the ones by niaz zaman, neeman sobhan and shabnam nadiya written originally in english) and the rest (well-known writers such as selina hossain, shaheen akhtar, rabeya khatun, farida hossain, sonia amin, purabi basu, nasreen jahan, makbula manzoor) being translations from the original bengali. the indian writers are volga, bani basu, suchitra bhattacharya, gauri deshpande, the perennial anthology favourite mahasweta devi, suraiya qasim, pratibha ray, temsula ao and kr meera (whose stunningly homespun tale of love retrieved from the debris of the special loneliness induced by illness has been reproduced above). the vernacular languages of india are well represented in this volume, ranging from urdu to telegu to oriya. especially welcome is the inclusion of temsula ao, since assamese writers tend to be under-represented in such anthologies. ms. ao lives and works in shillong, writes in english, and has published a book of short stories these hills called home: stories from a war zone (previously reviewed in this page). among the bangladeshi writers shabnam nadiya's piece titled 'parakrousis' (which along with some stories being written by a writer not in this collection, abeer hoque) may signal a break with the recording of genteel bourgeoisie sensibilities that is still the hallmark of bangladeshi women writing in english. hanif qureshi, who as a young man churned out the stuff, once proclaimed the iron law of english pornography of the '60s: 'no sex with pets or blacks'. so too in bangladeshi women's english fiction no woman lights up a ciggie, forgets to put on underwear and run over a cat with her car. and absolutely no sex with pets! but things might be changing.

news brief
international arms transfers there has been an almost 50 per cent increase in the volume of major conventional arms transfers over the past four years, reversing a downward trend after 1997. the usa and russia were the largest suppliers in the five-year period 20022006, each accounting for around 30 per cent of global deliveries. exports from european union (eu) members to non-eu countries accounted for just over 20 per cent of global deliveries. because of its very limited internal market, the russian arms industry remains heavily dependent on exportsmost newly produced weapons in russia are exportedto maintain an arms industry and fund development of new weapons and technology. this limits the possibility that russia will exercise restraint in its arms exports. the arms industries of the usa and eu members are in general far less export dependent. view the page star books review
understanding bangladesh's experience with militancy
global war on terror: bangladesh perspective is a compilation of the proceedings of a seminar of the same nomenclature, organised by the bangladesh institute of international and strategic studies. the disconcerting aspect of this arrangement might be gleaned from the contents page, chronologically placed: “welcome speech” by abul basher imamuzzaman, “address by chief guest” by m. morshed khan, “chairman's speech: global war on terror: bangladesh perspective” by mufleh r osmany, “bangladesh's fight against terror: lessons learnt and future perspectives” by reaz rahman, “bangladesh's quest for a moderate muslim state” by m. ataur rahman, “an emerging model of counter-terror infrastructure and the role of military and state security apparatus” by mohd aminul karim, “terrorism in south asia: ramifications in the internal and external security of states: a bangladesh perspective” by m. sakhawat hussain, and “bangladesh perspectives in the global war on terrorism: british engagement with bangladesh in counter terrorism: opportunities for cooperation” by mizanur rahman shelley. it takes away from the reader expectations associated with a properly drawn-up book.
the personal and the political
the demolition of the babri masjid on december 6, 1992 in ayodhya, the 1984 sikh massacre, the riots in bombay, the carnage in gujarat, and even earlier, the assassination of mahatma gandhi are the essential tipping off points for david davidar's new novel. with wry humour, the author notes that even “333 million gods” could not save india.
generosity and thin slices of turkey
clare chambers' story telling gift has the novelistic richness of a seasoned master. the author's book in a good light is like a breath of fresh air for the reader. the story is told with a delightful simplicity that leads the reader on like a journey on a beautiful spring day. one does not feel like putting the book down even for a short spell, the reading is addictive. and yet the accelerating plot and twists are more than just clever surprises.
of free markets and benevolence
when i asked jerald posman, the vice president of cuny york college and columnist of the new york times, to make a comment about muhammad yunus, he replied, “nobody did as much to empower women as muhammad yunus. he is an icon in the women empowering movement”. my sentiments are similar to posman's when it comes to the contribution of yunus to changing women's lives. in his new book, creating a world without poverty, yunus tales the story of a movement begun forty years ago which changed millions of women' lives.

shamsuddin abul kalam o tar patrabali
abdul matin
radical asia publications, london dhaka
a work that has been a long time coming, it promises to shed new light on shamsuddin abul kalam. for today's generation, kalam remains a remote or even an unknown figure. that is reason enough to suppose that abdul matin's efforts to revive the legacy of the past, of which kalam is a significant component, are laudable.
