rejuvenating smes
the bangladesh bank (bb)'s decision to set financial targets for the commercial banks in order to enhance their lending operation for the small and medium enterprise (sme) sector is commendable in view of the fact that it will go to ensure better use of the huge funds known to be lying idle with them. this renewed attention of the central bank towards this mostly labour-intensive sector will help stimulate the sector better and create employment.
lanes on the roads
the emphasis that has been placed of late on improving traffic conditions in the city is surely welcome. it is a sign of how seriously the authorities, especially those in the traffic police department, are looking at the problem. and now that they have come up with plans for a three-lane based movement of vehicular traffic, all we can say is that we as citizens desperately hope the measure yields results. indeed, that there should be different lanes on the roads is a given anywhere in the world. unfortunately, in our instance, the idea of lanes, despite being there all the time, has not quite worked owing to a multiplicity of reasons. such a condition cannot any more be permitted to continue, for reasons that should be obvious.

pakistan makes good beginning
i found a big difference between the perceptions in india and pakistan on the anniversary of 26/11, the terror attack on mumbai. india reconstructed the 60-hour tragedy and vowed not to "tolerate" any such act in the future. pakistan said that it had expressed its horror adequately in the past and that by dwelling on it india was avoiding a composite dialogue. and there was a string of familiar accusations and counter-accusations. sometimes i think that only a miracle can bring them close. view the page sports

i am indeed indebted to mr chisti of lalmatia for his letter in ds 18 nov on the subject supporting rickshaws. before going in to details i would draw his attention to the letter “vip roads” by ameer sobhan, a student of nsu in the adjoining column. ameer has raised pertinent points in defense of the rickshaw in the circumstances prevailing today that will partly answer some of mr chisti's fears. we will talk about the freeways, new roads, subways, metros, circular rails, waterways and other lollipops when they are a reality, not before.
president of european commission
i am glad tony blair did not get the job. he had alienated a lot of british muslims by the invasion of iraq on falsified intelligence report and labour lost the tower hamlets constituency (last labour mp, oona king) to george galloway's respect party. many european countries were against the candidacy of blair although he was the most known name in the running. blair's running generated mild xenophobia against britain and the belgian newspaper la capitale just before the final selection printed a list of "10 reasons to hate britain" widely covered in the british media.
my orphaned life!
as much as i talk to the bangladeshis' at home and abroad, the signals they send out, reminds me of a common terminology (“whatever”) that americans use a lot. this is a lingo that american teenagers use to express their sense of frustration, however the adults use it too, when they do not or can not make a sense of complicated or semi complicated issues. most of the time bangladeshis' frustration would be expressed as “the country is screwed up, i don't give a damn, let them do whatever they want, allah is displeased with us etc”. almost all the comments would send a signal of learned helplessness, hopelessness, sadness, irritability.
