beauvoir, austen and the idea of marriage
simone de beauvoir, in her seminal feminist text, the second sex, in the chapter on the married woman, wrote: 'marriage has always been a very different thing for man and for woman', and then went on to explain what this difference is in the rest of the chapter. according to beauvoir, the institution of marriage is not based on a 'footing of equality'. once we accept the basic tenet of inequality on which marriage between man and woman is premised, everything falls into place. there may be some exceptions to this rule, but beauvoir was not concerned with exceptions. neither am i. we're here concerned with the typical marriage, where the treatment of the wife as an inferior being who must sacrifice herself for her husband and his children is the rule. even if the woman receives a dowry or some inheritance she can call her own, she is still enslaved to her husband and his family. in return for her labours, the wife is of course given protection, food and shelter. how is this situation different from glorified slavery? asks beauvoir.

love in the hereafter
love between a man and woman is a gift from heaven. yet this gift is like a delicate thread when shared by two people who are not supposed to be in love. but what can these people do when cupid has pierced their hearts? just wishing to be out of love does not make the gift go away. it is not something that you wash away like the wave that wipes away the writing on the sand. trust and belief in love hold these two people together even when hidden, lurking danger shadows them all the time. view the page star health

all those men and our heritage . . .
abdul matin's interest in bangladesh's politics, indeed its overall historical legacy, has endured despite his being away from the country for more than half a century. his links with bangladesh and its people remain as strong as they were when he made his move to britain in 1960. unlike so many others, his curiosity about the country has been a constant, a truth which manifested itself especially well during the war of liberation in 1971 when he threw himself wholesale into garnering foreign support for the bengali cause.
