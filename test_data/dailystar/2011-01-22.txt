oil spill: impact on marine environment
on the 20th of december, 2010 an oil spill was detected in the bay off sitakunda in chittagong. it was over 3 kilometers long and 300-400 feet wide with a reddish- black layer. it is suspected that, the cause of the oil spill was the unauthorised transfer or intentional dump of oil into the sea to salvage the grounded indian flag carrier ocean pearl. it was a huge spill but still it is unknown how much oil they actually released into the sea. we have yet to know to what extent the area was affected. the doe has served a notice to sygma shipping line, the parent company of ocean pearl, to answer why the company would not be prosecuted for causing oil spill in the bay. but we have yet to know what necessary action has been taken. so far we only know that the port authority has not taken any legal action against the ocean pearl.
water crisis to rice crisis in coming decades?
bangladesh is blessed with suitable soil and climate for growing rice in all three crop seasons in a year. rice grown during summer is locally known as aus, during monsoon as aman and during winter as boro. the boro is really the improved rice variety that is cultivated in almost all rice fields during winter. winter rice is typically called boro but is now cultivated in other seasons too. gradual expansion of improved rice farming contributed much to total rice production increasing more than three times over the last three decades. the winter rice farming was a demand-led adoption by all types of farmers because of its higher productivity and it being produced in dry season almost in risk-free environment. view the page literature
elias, bankim . . . and perspectives
akhtaruzzaman elias is arguably the most radical novelist of bangladesh. although he had written only two novels, he is recognised to be among the most critically acclaimed bengali novelists. to read or confront his writing is to go through an experience that radically changes our worldview and questions carefully constructed rationales and dogmas. in the canon of 20th century bengali fiction, no one's writings are more unsettling yet fascinating than elias's. however, it is beyond the scope of this article to give what is usually called an overview of elias's writings. in what follows i attempt to present some of my observations on his second novel khoabnama (1996).

an enigma of a soldier . . .
ataul ghani osmany remains a point of reference for bengalis who take justified pride in his role during the war of liberation. there is then a class of people who have never failed to underscore osmany's credentials as a democrat through reminding everyone of the manner of his resignation from parliament in january 1975 once the fourth amendment to the constitution came to pass. osmany was unwilling to accept a switch over to the one-party state that bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman brought into being with the setting up of the bangladesh krishak sramik awami league in that year. osmany will remain noted for his valedictory remark in the jatiyo sangsad --- that he was not willing to see a mujib khan in bangladesh. the allusion was of course to the dictatorship of ayub khan in pakistan between 1958 and 1969.
. . . a dictator and his victims
bangladesh's history in its first decade of freedom was fundamentally a story of bloodletting. you do not have to go into research to arrive at such a morbid conclusion. but you cannot escape feeling a certain sense of irony as you recapitulate the whole episode of the country's actually claiming, and taking, its place in the global community. if the war of liberation in 1971 saw three million bengalis dying at the hands of the pakistan armed forces, the post-liberation era turned into a long tale of blood and gore as most of the new nation's founding fathers and war heroes bit the dust through bloody coups d'etat and internecine armed conflict. the series of tragic happenings that engulfed bangladesh between august and november 1975, followed by the execution of abu tahir, a soldier for freedom, in july 1976, will remain a blot on the conscience of a nation which yet struggles to find a way out of the woods for itself.
