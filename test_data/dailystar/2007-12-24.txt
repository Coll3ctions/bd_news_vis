mosque blast in pakistan
the bomb blast in a mosque in peshwar that left 50 people killed and scores injured has sent shock waves throughout the world. no one in a sensible state of mind can comprehend anyone spilling blood of innocent devotees in a prayer house, that again on the eid day. the mindless act was disrespect for religion of the worst kind and deserves condemnation in strongest of words. what is more distressing is the fact that introduction of suicide attacks on soft targets for attaining political gains will have added a new but dangerous dimension to the strife-ridden politics in pakistan.

tigers revel at seddon park
the bangladeshi fans arrived in numbers from all parts of new zealand and seddon park saw a tigers party for the first time. with the twenty20 fixture against a new zealand cricket xi arranged to raise funds for the affected from mid-november's cyclone sidr the bangladesh team were obligated to play quality cricket and they delivered. the new zealand xi were restricted to 133/7 and then despite a few hiccups in the middle the tourists had the depth to run away with a four-wicket win with three overs to spare. this was bangladesh's first victory on new zealand soil and there couldn't have been a more festive atmosphere to celebrate that.

''biharis in bangladesh"
this is in response to the letter 'biharis in bangladesh" by mr. jamshaid taher published on 30 nov.
price hike
when the prices of daily essentials are increasing rapidly and going beyond our capacity, there is no effort to stop this by the present ctg!! the daily life of ours (middle class people) is becoming really miserable day by day. but the business community is showing no sensitivity to our problems; they are trying to maximise their profits all the time. they have formed syndicates to retain control over the market.
sidr and slogans
it is pretty clear that everyone knows how painful and deadly hunger is. the cyclone sidr has devastated the whole south region of our country. people have lost what they had. food is the first requirement to survive. no food, no shelter. my home is in barguna, a cyclone affected area. i know how it feels in the depth of my heart to see my fellow men starve. but i was shocked to see the news published in a daily a few days ago that a party had started demonstrating against us aid. my question is to those who were in that demonstration, "can you sustain hunger? have you ever remained hungry for days? what will you realise hearing the screams of the fleshless bones?"
small investors
i am small investor of dhaka stock exchange. i have already invested all my savings with some loans also. the security exchange commission has the right to control the market, but the prices of all shares (except 2/3 “a” category companies) were declining before eid. is it an example of good management by sec to secure the market? as i see from a newspaper, the sec feels the market is now more secure for all small investors. i don't think so and i am totally disappointed with their views. if the share prices fall, then how the investors become secure? as far as i know most of the small investors have sold their shares and withdrew their money from the market as they have the memories of 1996. i want to ask the authorities: are they thinking that the decreasing trend is safe for investors? we feel badly insecure.
meaning of sacrifice
the ntv was airing an online fund raising programme by a london based relief organisation named "islamic relief". it was in the afternoon in california, usa and late night in bangladesh on december 2/3 2007. the telecast was interesting to watch, especially the question asked by would be donors. a number of questions was asked about the modus of operandi of the organisation in bangladesh relief efforts. in support of their claim, they were projecting a tv documentary of relief work being undertaken by them in the affected areas. the moderator was supported by a high up of the organisation ( looked an arab ) and one local bangladeshi islamic scholar as introduced by the moderator, a bangladeshi.
another setback
it seems that there is no respite for us, first the political turmoil, crime, corruption etc. now we are besieged by calamities one after another. unprecedented floods engulfed us twice, then the furious cyclone struck and left a trail of devastation, we are feeling very sad, our deepest sympathy for the affected people, may the almighty allah give them strength to bear the ordeal.
a teacher's stand
today's events at the court were no different from that of yesterday. the judge once again framed charges and the four dhaka university professors were accused of violating the emergency power rules 2007. as you can quite clearly see, nothing new. however something did happen today. my father after the submissions of the lawyers sought permission from the judge to say a few words. his few words ended up as what i would term it as one of the most historic speeches made in a court of law. i do not remember all of it but here is what i remember of it in english:
meaning of life
i found it interesting that a reader has been asking around about the meaning of life. i can't blame him, i often do the same thing. interestingly (or rather, should it be obviously), no one has yet come up with an answer, and some tell me coming up with an answer would spoil it. personally, i do find it rather perplexing that we can barely answer the question 'what is life for' and still continue onwards with it with such overwhelming zeal. perhaps that is why they dub it the human condition - the species which has done so much for its survival and enhancement without even understanding and penetrating the meaning of it.
police clearance
i'm writing on this subject again. i am a bangladeshi now living in the uk. i need a police clearance certificate . but i cannot find any form in the internet.
government servants
one of the most praiseworthy works of the ctg is finding out the corrupt people. for the first time, the acc is working smoothly. i really appreciate whatever they are doing. but i think at the same time the government has to do something to prevent corruption.
english at ssc level
it is seen that in different public exams the students fail in english mostly. but why? the reasons are not very far to seek if we deeply think over it. even many of us definitely know the reasons of their failure in that subject. so, i am not going to highlight the same. but i could not but mention a point here that especially in the ssc exams, there are only two compositions in the questions of english 2nd paper and the students are to answer one out of the two while five compositions are set up in the questions of bengali 2nd paper and the students are told to answer one out of five. i think that this discrimination should be removed and my suggestion is that our education policy makers set up five compositions and at least three paragraphs in english 2nd paper in lieu of two compositions and one paragraph and if it is done, the percentage of pass in ssc will increase somewhat.
us aid
refer to ms. pasi's letter of 29 november in which she ticks off the various forms of assistance from the us government to bangladesh. the aid that the us government provides to bangladesh is helpful and there is no doubt about that. however, ms. pasi should understand that humanitarian aid, in and of itself, will never wash away the “mistakes” of the us administration over the past five years. illegal detentions and lack of respect for due process at guantanamo bay, cuba, the destruction of iraq, the killing of untold numbers of civilians in iraq and afghanistan in “collateral damage”, kidnappings, also known as extra-ordinary renditions, false reports of weapons of mass destruction in iraq, torture in prison, and the list goes on and on. it is indeed sad that the usa, once the champion of human rights and democracy, is looked on with contempt and pity by many people in this world. ms. pasi, if you could write an article setting out how the us government will set these past wrongs right, that would really cause us to sit up and take notice.
business scene
when i get the morning newspaper, i turn to the business page for new developments in new products, and opening of new export markets; the challenges before the smes. without entrenched corrupt practices at almost all vertical and horizontal levels, today we could have easily reached the base level of a newly developing country. our workers are hard working and sincere, but the godfathers have no fear of god! view the page international
