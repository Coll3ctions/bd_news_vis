the anthrax issue
eighteen new cases of anthrax have come to light in lalmonirhat district. reports of an incidence of anthrax in lakshmipur have also been there. as far as we are aware, no fewer than 520 people all over the country have in the past couple of months been affected by the disease and, we are informed, half of them have already been provided with treatment. there may be a bit of hope here and we might tell ourselves that the disease, contracted through eating meat, especially beef, will soon go away. and yet new reports such as the one from lalmonirhat raise the very pertinent question of how effective the measures so far taken to combat the problem are. our conclusion is that a whole lot more, in terms of prioritising the issue, is called for. if one individual is cured of anthrax and then two fresh cases crop up, it is a sign of the huge difficulties we are confronted with.

losses in fruit business
an important article on the subject was published in the 'business' pages of a local daily on 3rd september. in my opinion, the write-up was rather ineffective, limited only to broad information from a number of sources.
taxi service
michaelangelo on being praised for his sculpture “pieta” is said to have replied “the sculpture was already there, all i did was to chip away the useless bits”. ms angela robinson's letter on the subject of taxi service in ds, 05 sep 10 prompted me to write this letter which i had been mulling over for a long time. the taxis are already here, all we have to do is organize them productively. the facts are these:
stephen hawking
i am a follower of stephen hawking and level his writings with great esteem. he maintains that 'the universe has the power to create and will in future create itself from gravity.' 'because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing.' he writes, “spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist.”
taxes for mps
from the media report, mr. obaidul quader opined that lawmakers should pay income tax as they take their honorarium from taxpayers' money. if people can pay taxes then why shouldn't the lawmakers pay income tax? lawmakers are exempted from tax on remuneration and allowances according to the 1973 members of parliament (remunerations and allowances) order. in fact, governance is a matter of setting moral standards for everyone to uphold. it begins at the top. that being the truth, let our mps correct the situation and convince the people of bangladesh that lawmakers are not and cannot be above the law. let them begin paying their dues to the republic. our members of parliament are already some of the best-paid legislators in the world, a fact that has drawn fire from their constituents who believe they should be paid less. it is totally ridiculous that our mps go home with huge perks per month while professionals like doctors earn less per month though they work more than 12 hours a day seven days a week! our mps? a few hours a week with more perks per day just for showing up! integrity of mps should be measured by the same ruler they use for the same country. they really don't care about the welfare of ordinary citizens. there are other more pressing matters we should be attending to like improving infrastructure instead of increasing salaries. bangladesh's economy is still recovering from the aftermath of a post-election crisis and an ensuing world economic downturn. yet another drastic pay hike for mps is the most outrageous, insensitive, immoral and intolerant abuse by bangladesh's officialdom the country has ever witnessed.
leadership plan of al
almost all the democratic governments and parties select, nurture, groom second and third line of leadership. suppose in india if anything happens to the present prime minister the next day probably pranab mukherjee will be sworn in as the next prime minister. the country will run smoothly. there won't be any chaos or confusion.
decentralisation
take a look around you and see the difference between a week ago and today september 10, 2010. this exactly the optimum size of population dhaka should have. unfortunately, we as a nation have become unfamiliar with the word optimum nay almost forgotten it. given the size of our country i.e. about 56,000 square miles it has at least a surplus population of 100 million.
clemency to convicts
the president's granting clemency to 20 al activists sentenced to death for murder is quite natural for bangladesh context where the ruling party is always there to nurture their party criminals. i remember rabindranth tagore's line, 'those who commit crime and those who tolerate it are tormented by the same kind of hatred'. that's all we the saner souls say now.
congrats to australian premier
we congratulate julia eileen gillard, the 27th and current prime minister of australia, on her winning the election held recently. it is learnt from the media that ms. gillard is going ahead with her plans to introduce a 30 per cent tax on iron ore and coal miners' profits, and make australia's biggest polluters pay for carbon gas emissions. she has further promised to invest about six billion us dollars on rural schools and hospitals.
favourite officers
during the last sixty-three-years the army officers who took control of the affairs of the country was favourite of the political leaders. brigadier general mohammad ayub khan served the political leaders while discharging duties during the tumultuous partition days. mohammad ali jinnah appointed him the first goc of the then east pakistan. liaquat ali khan, the first prime minister of pakistan, appointed adjutant general of pakistan army general mohammad ayub khan as the first commander-in-chief of the pakistan army.
promoting tourism products
the giants in the hotel industry do not consistently use new media modules in the process of promoting their products. only a few of the larger hotels and resorts have created basic it applications such as a website to promote their products. but in the future the technological application should be utilised more to attract many tourists.
communal harmony
i am sure that i am not the only person who was appalled by the prospect of a single, independent and obscure american congregation, burning a copy of the holy qu'ran, on september 11th. this church is not connected to any major christian denomination and this action has no official christian sanction at all, even within the usa, never name the world. despite the hurricane of protest from those of all religions and none - plus government (e.g. hilary clinton) and secular authorities - this misled congregation may, unfortunately, go ahead with this action that has rightly been called 'unnecessary, offensive and dangerous'.
ensure equality
we see from the news published in your daily that some of those convicted by the court with death by hanging in a murder case and have recently been pardoned by the honourable president, are coming out from the jail with television antenna and paddle stand fans in hands (ds: 08.09.10). as per the jail code no accused, especially who are under capital punishment, is allowed to bring anything in other than their clothes and essentials. the jail authorities are supposed to ensure the comfort and convenience of the inmates. but since they are the members of the ruling party, none obstructed them from bringing in whatever they wished, i suppose. view the page international
