another victim of violence against women
the burn unit of dhaka medical college and hospital (dmch) bears witness to another act of barbarity on a woman by her husband. as reported on the back page of the thursday issue of this paper, day labourer swapan scalded her wife shikha khandaker with boiling water because she failed to bring the one lakh taka he had de-manded a second time as dowry, though he already re-ceived one lakh taka during their wedding 15 years back. hapless shikha, as the report goes, was no stranger to tortures like regular beating at her husband's hands, but she suffered all through silently. this last act of outrage might also have gone unnoticed had she not landed up in the burn unit of dmch.

why hartal?
in the oxford dictionary the meaning of hartal has been mentioned as, “the closing of shops and offices in india as a mark of protest or sorrow.” according to this definition, hartal is a property of india and we have inherited the same. but in the next new edition the authors of oxford dictionary would probably correct this definition by replacing the word india by bangladesh as we are playing the leading role in observing hartal as well as incorporating new strategy / actions such as killing people, damaging and torching vehicles and factories to make the hartal successful.
chemicals in foods
rotten, unhygienic, and expired food products, etc cause widespread health problem in bangladesh. it is a habitual offence that needs to be addressed by public awareness and education. simply, taking these kinds of date-expired or rotten foods in our stomach will definitely make us sick though not gravely. but consuming formalin mixed fish and mobile mixed oil cooked foods will slowly lead us to death. stories often appear in newspapers of dried fish being preserved with officially banned ddt powder or other insecticides. fish is no longer a favourite option for many city dwellers on their everyday menu, as the sale of formalin-laced fish has become a rampant practice in the city's kitchen markets, endangering public health. it is not just fish that is treated with harmful chemicals; urea fertilizer is being used to make puffed rice, an essential item that goes with almost all iftar items to make it whiter and more attractive. these unscrupulous traders invariably claim that the products they sell are fresh and not treated with chemicals for business purposes. even milk sellers use drops of formalin to keep their pots of milk fresh. if anyone asks the vendors how they keep the fish, fruits and vegetables fresh, some of them may give a simple yet hazardous answer, “medicine”. medicine here means formalin and calcium carbide. carbides are used to ripen fruits. scientists and doctors have warned that sustained consumption of food laced with toxic chemicals has debilitating effect on the human body and could even lead to multiple failures of such vital organs as liver and kidney. but who cares?
afghanistan's minerals!
an article on the subject, written by an american, was published on 4 july in the pages of a local english daily. the writer, possibly quite rightly criticizes pentagon's estimated value of the afghan minerals at us$ one trillion! he is sceptical on how the estimates could be drawn without proper mineral survey and mapping, and based on random finds here and there; in the midst of an ongoing war! logically it seems to be an irrational, amateurish and totally speculative to be classified as having commercial exploitation potential for mining.
road accidents
many a cause may be there behind road accidents but it is recognised that most of the accidents are happening as a result of the recklessness of the drivers who sometimes ignore the rules and discipline of driving.
here and there
our traffic police farce: my last letter (ds 4 july) on dhaka's traffic had concluded with the challenge that only when the controlling authorities found the will and resolve (now totally absent) to book everyone found guilty of breaking the traffic laws, would there be improvement. i am very happy to eat my words. it seems that there is at least one amongst our traffic cops with enough guts to file a complaint against an mp, stuck in a jam, for assaulting him in public!!!
question leakage
nowadays we observe that incidence of question leakage is occurring frequently, especially in the selection test of a few public sector jobs and in the admission test of some public universities. these are mainly due to evil deeds of some govt, or university employees. there is a huge lack of morality, transparency, accountability and patriotism among them.
human rights
i am not a professional hr activist but a firm believer of human rights. the other day we saw the new chairman of the hrc speaking to the press about his conviction and commitment to hr issues in bangladesh. i regret to mention that i was not quite convinced of his idea of having their own investigative staff well trained in hr violation investigation. the reason, the police dept has eroded their public perception in conducting enquiry. this might encourage others to have their own cell for enquiry. the chairman might rethink or look for practical alternatives to mitigate hr violations, and keep aside the theoretical and academic aspects of the hr issues. the feasible alternative is to have a separate cell in the police dept and train them with the specific need of the hrc i.e. need based job oriented training and retraining.
jamaat leaders' disclosures
it is very dangerous news for us.
a fair election
we have recently watched a very free, fair, transparent and acceptable election in the chittagong city corporation. the opposition candidate m manzur alam got elected in the election. after his victory the prime minister of the state hailed him and hoped that he would do good for the port city people. and leaders of the govt also welcomed him. there were no complaints regarding rigging of polls from any quarters. this really augurs well for the growth of democracy in bangladesh. as common people, we wish that both the government and the opposition will do healthy politics and shun the path of violence for the betterment of the country and its people.
attention: rajuk
i applied for a plot in uttara in last year's lottery as an expatriate. i did not win any plot and submitted my application for refund on january 26, 2010. my receipt number is 558 & the expected refund date was march 29. so far i have not received my refund. i called rajuk probashi kallayan cell without any success. i sent an email to rajuk chairman, but no response. i am running out of ideas on how to get my refund back. i would appreciate if the rajuk authorities can step in.
do something about it
during the whole 2010 fifa world cup, the residents of mohammadpur area went through a dismal time due to the on going load shedding. most of the crucial matches were half watched, much to the dismay of the local people. i just think, world cups come once every four year and bearing that in mind, couldn't the government ensure full power supply during the crucial matches? bangladesh is football crazy and we crave for watching such big events but our enthusiasm is all drained by some people.
hijab and some questions
i love hijab and having studied torah, bible and the holy quran, i can say that modesty has been enjoined in all the divine revelations. appearance is an important aspect of our communication with others and it does make sense that god has defined modesty or the appearance that we should have. god defined it so that we are not divided over the issue of what to wear or what to consider as modest. i agree that hijab minimizes the risk of sexual harassment. however, what bothers me is the notion that not wearing the hijab is the main cause behind eve-teasing. i don't remember the specific details, but not so long ago, a female burkha-clad student was harassed at a public university. was she at fault too, given that she was modestly dressed? if god has commanded women to dress modestly, he has also commanded men to lower their gaze. hijab is not just about dressing modestly, but also about behaving modestly and it goes for both men and women. “everyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” (matthew 5:28). “tell the believing men to lower their gaze and be modest.” ( holy quran 24:30). it does not matter whether the girl is covered or not, the men have to lower the gaze. in the above verses, it does not say that a man has to lower the gaze only if the women wear hijab. in fact, logically, a man should lower his gaze even more if the girl is not modestly dressed. just like women wear hijab irrespective of how the men view them; men have to lower the gaze irrespective of how the women are dressed.

hearing delayed
the high court and the supreme court are the highest judicial bodies in every country. they are the protectors of the country's constitution and laws that are made by parliament.
proper use of tax money
the honourable president of bangladesh while receiving the annual audit report from the auditor and comptroller general advised the team to make all out efforts so that the money realised as tax from the common men is not misused in any way. he realised the facts that the development works funded by the government are not always ended without blame. there is a widespread accusation that the tenders of government works are not fairly done and there are syndicates everywhere. it is a fact that in spite of government's sincere efforts, the pace of development work is very slow and even the money earmarked for many projects is returned at the end of the financial year. the departments concern are not aware of the quality of the works or they even do not properly supervise the work. the lion's share of the project money goes to the pocket of the dishonest contractors and the officers and engineers of the supervising department. everybody knows that the development works are funded by the money from the government exchequer which is fattened by the tax money realised from the general mass as vat and income tax. people of bangladesh whether rich or poor have to pay vat while purchasing any commodity like edible oil, sugar, gas, cosmetics, clothes and availing services like gas, electricity, wasa etc. vat is a sort of indirect tax and every consumer is bound to pay it and income tax is levied on a class of people having income above certain limits. so, everyone feels the pain while paying it as extra amount.
brilliant suggestions
i read with interest the article, “ how to get rid of load shedding?” written by eng. abdul matin in your daily of april 7, 2010. the hot topic of the day has been presented in a very clear and simple language. the study of the background, analysis of the whole situation and the ultimate conclusion on the problem are, to say the least, unbiased and pragmatic. he addressed the problem with an insight into the multifarious aspects of the power supply and demand position of the country. he suggested immediate, medium term and long-term solutions. they appear to be quite feasible and as such deserve serious consideration. it has been concluded, “the blame game will no longer console the power and energy starving people”. i congratulate engg. matin for his brilliant ideas.
