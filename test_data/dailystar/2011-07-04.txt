no etp in two years?
the government has sought two more years from the high court to set up an effluents treatment plant (etp) in savar and relocate tanneries from the city's hazaribagh area. the appeal is as inexplicable as it is worrying. it is inexplicable because two years have already elapsed since the high court issued its directives on the etp in june 2009 and in all this period the authorities have done nothing but seek an extension of time for the work to be completed. it is worrying because, as the authorities point out, there is no shortage of funds for the work and yet things have not been moving. one thus has a fine instance here of shoddy bureaucracy impeding a move aimed at ensuring public safety in the capital.
airline staff's errant behaviour
it seems that sometimes airline staff forget that they are paid to serve the passengers. and sometimes their imperious attitude makes them forget that it is their responsibility to ensure that all those that have preferred to fly their airline have a hassle free and safe journey from the time they check in. it doesn't happen all the time. recently, the unfortunate victims of the fault of a staff of eithad airlines in abu dhabi airport were a mother and daughter. view the page sports

liberation war in textbooks
we have a glorious history of liberation war. yet, our schools do not teach this chapter with much importance. the bangla medium schools follow “amar boi” as the textbook up to class-7. each part of this book includes a chapter on one of the seven bir sreshthos. a few schools teach a little of 21st february, 26th march and 16th december as part of general knowledge. the english medium schools follow only the book given from the board, that is, “amar boi”. our students grow up not knowing much on liberation war. it is sad that after 40 years of our great liberation war, we hear from a student of class-1 that a “clash” occurred between bangladesh and pakistan in 1971. but how can we blame that kid when we watched a video on facebook after pakistan won the match at icc cricket world cup 2011, held at mirpur stadium, where a young man said with delight, “that is past, we forgot it!” if this is the situation today, what will happen after ten or twenty years?
trapped between schools and coaching centres?
a growing frustration is brewing in the minds of the guardians as well as the students concerning the credibility of the schools and their teachers who are entrusted with the noble task of building the future of the nation. the guardians think that there is no point in spending a huge amount of money every month on the school fees besides spending almost double the amount in a forced manner in coaching centres for the same purpose. the guardians fail to understand why extra coaching is needed when the schools are paying their teachers for doing the same job. it may sound ridiculous, but the bare fact is that it is the teachers who insist the students to take extra lessons at their coaching centres, which are mostly situated at their homes, in order to excel and get better results in the examinations. it is reckoned that a school teacher, besides getting his usual salaries in the school, earns tk. 1.5 lakh on an average per month by coaching students privately. in older days, teachers vehemently discouraged students about having private coaching saying that if they didn't understand lessons, they should ask them. what a difference between now and then! now everything is evaluated in terms of money! now teachers create such a situation that students are compelled to go for coaching or he/she will surely fail in the exam. i am certain that this practice would seriously impede students' ability in acquiring desired education. can our authorities concerned ban private coaching for good? i would also urge the authorities to check if these teachers pay taxes properly.
