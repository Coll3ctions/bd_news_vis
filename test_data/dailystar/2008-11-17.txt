say 'no' to hartal
like many occasions in the past, business leaders have once again urged the political parties to refrain from calling country-wide hartal, as a way to bargain with the power that be. with the people expecting a qualitative change in politics the call has a special ring of relevance to it. such call has come from a sense of urgency for keeping economy at the centre of national priority objectives. the ongoing global economic meltdown further reinforces the need for constructive politics as opposed to hartal-centric confrontational politics.

an exercise in surrealism
in a troubled time, when the regular political process is in suspended animation, the best bet for the politicians is to lie low and let the storm blow over. while it's prudent not to make insinuative remarks in political discourse, it's equally wise not to react to innuendoes thrown by others. after all, it's an unusual time!
in the semi-final analysis…
the current assembly elections are not quite the semi-finals that they are being billed to be, for the nationwide electorate will determine the fate of the upa government, and not just voters in six states. but it is beyond debate that these results will set the mood for general elections, now expected at the very last legal minute, which means april-may. these are arguably the most important of the mini-general elections that have dotted the political calendar over the last two years.

ctg slackening its grip?
we do not want to believe the present caretaker government basically stood on the quick sands. the army stepped forward to save our country from a civil war or some happenings extremely deleterious for the country at that crucial time. the then caretaker government, the election commission and the militant political parties were obsessed with playing a highly destructive game. the people became helpless spectators having no direction as to what to do. at that crucial juncture the army came to their rescue and the present caretaker government came into being. so it will not be wrong to presume that this caretaker government stood basically on a hard ground backed by the strong custodian of our sovereignty. it performed a lot of good jobs for the country and the people and made some mistakes also during its tenure of eighteen or nineteen months. it is our bad luck that the evil forces prevalent in our country have become triumphant again to portray the good jobs as bad and the mistakes as blunders. they restored their grip on the politics of the country and want all their criminal hands out of handcuffs.

obama, the president-elect of the us said on november 07, 2008 that iran must be prevented from developing nuclear weapons.
hasina's return
sheikh hasina's returning home may have created a lot of enthusiasm, zeal and excitement among her supporters, but the way thousands of supporters blocked the roads with processions during office hours just to welcome the leader was unacceptable, to say the least. it caused harassment to common people going to workplaces in the morning. there were even minors, who could not be voters, showing extra enthusiasm, making a chaotic environment all around.
bcs botched up
the bcs exams were held at least a year ago, but it is a matter of great shame that the psc still can not fix up who actually passed or failed. some examinees decided to kill themselves if their demands were not met. but now we have come to know that others, who were selected later, also decided to kill themselves.
poverty
poverty cannot be removed overnight. what we need is some good planning & implementation of those plans to mobilize manpower towards effective production.
voter turnout in us elections
on the basis of population the us is the third largest country of the world. also, it is the second largest country practising democracy. but voter turnout in us elections is one of the poorest among the advanced industrial nations of the world. a little over 50 percent of the voting-age population take part in us presidential elections. there was plenty of euphoria in the recently held us election as many claimed a record voter turnout. this exuberance was primarily based on the observation that voters in many locations had to stand in long queues for hours, primarily arising out of shortage of polling centres. the arithmetic of voter turnout has indeed been a dismal one, not significantly different from those of the previous years. based on a number of reliable sources available on the internet, it appears that the voter turnout in the present election was around 122,457,990 out of a voting-age population of 231,229,580.

myanmar's misadventure
our neighbouring country myanmar made an expedition on the bay of bengal in search of oil and gas. as far as i know, according to international navigation laws no country can make such kind of exploration in the territory belonging to some other country.
dress codes
nowadays non-islamic acts are encouraged strongly in society. most "modern" people in our country don't have proper faith and young people who are growing up now are encouraged to practise western dress codes. this is termed as being "modern" & "smart" but none realizes that this is bringing obscenity to society. i don't know what good can come out of it. we should wear nice dresses, but these should be modest.
taxpayer's query
as faithful citizens we are obliged to pay taxes as per laws of the government to enable the latter to carryout the duties entrusted on it. paying taxes is actually a give-and -take matter. if a citizen finds that his or her basic rights are being well taken care of by the government, then he or she shall come forward to pay the taxes voluntarily or will not feel that the tax-payment is a penalty.

congratulations to president-elect barack obama and consolation to senator mccain. both of them deserve appreciation for the spirit they have shown in upholding and retaining the democratic norms and values one by winning the election and the other by graciously conceding defeat!
points to ponder
the almighty is above any kind of controversy, question and criticism. now the question is whether the judges shall also enjoy the same immunity of faith that they are above criticism or not accountable for their acts and deeds. no way one can question about any judicial matter.
bji's game plan
you will agree that in the recent days the jamaat [renamed themselves as bji] was hyperactive. their attitude showed that they were the prime power players of the 4-party alliance. soon after the one/eleven, except the jamaat, all other political parties went through humiliations. the bji managed to hide themselves under the bed sheet. the ctg and the law enforcers could not find them! their leaders claimed that they did not participate in the plundering during the bnp-jamaat led government that ruled bangladesh between 2001 and 2007. now two of their 'gang or ring' leaders were sent to jail. they protested, as if either of the two 'begums' [as mentioned in the economist] were sent to jail!
bay crisis
there were some dismal and worrisome headlines published in your daily for a few days. on november 3: "myanmar brings warships to explore bangladesh waters." on november 4: "myanmar defies warnings." on november 5: "myanmar sends another warship" and on november 6: "myanmar suspends exploration in bay." these headlines clearly give us the true impression how volatile the situation really was. this news also gives us a warning sign that we are in danger of foreign invasion and our armed forces should be constantly ready to face any eventuality.
commuters' nightmare
with gas prices ever on the rise, people living farther from the workplace, and traffic conditions worsening by the week, the daily commute is increasingly having an impact on our wallets and our lifestyles -- as well as global climate change. from getting the best gas mileage to work-from-home jobs to reducing air travel and international travel (by holding teleconferences, for example), improving your commute means improving your quality of life.
