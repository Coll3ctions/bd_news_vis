saarc summit in thimpu
there may be, and for all the right reasons, a good number of questions about the south asian association for regional cooperation (saarc). to what extent it has been able to solidify links between and among its eight member nations in the last twenty-five years of its existence is a question that will have many answers. whether the cup has been half full or half empty, as india's manmohan singh would like to put it, is a matter of analysis. for now, though, there are some encouraging signs of how saarc can move ahead from here on. principal among the pointers to the future is the unanimity saarc heads of government and state have reached on the issue of tackling climate change at the 16th summit of the organization in thimpu. prime minister sheikh hasina clearly set the mood through her call for a himalayan council, on the pattern of the arctic council, to handle the fall-out from climate change. understandably, her counterparts have agreed with her, which again is a sign of the seriousness with which saarc takes the issue.

floods
earlier, on an average in ten to twelve years a big flood would occur in our country. those floods were very devastating and would cause harm to lives and crops etc.
women's role
in bangladesh women population is almost "half" the total population. unfortunately, they face lots of problems in their daily life. these can be summarised as follows:
books
it is widely said that a book is the reflection of one's mind. when we read good books, our inner literary mind is gradually developed and begins to give us the real taste of literature. in the heart of literature, our daily affairs, hopes and aspirations get life.
burglary
every day, at every moment, the city dwellers are at the risk of burglary. ranging from banal to precious, torn sandal to mobile phone, laptop and so on are being stolen. no law enforcement body has yet been successful in stopping this.
power supply
the electric power supply for a particular day has been as follows:
facebook, not for us
today, a new word has been added to our everyday life. the name of that word is facebook. the students are very much fond of this facebook. day by day, its popularity is increasing sharply. with the help of mobile too, this facebook can be used.
shuttle train service
what if we have high walls erected on both sides of the railway track from kamalapur station to joydevpur station with flyover at all railway crossings and start a frequent shuttle train service between these two points with stopovers at as many places possible? would not this be an alternative commuting service for people living in joydevpur, uttara, baridhara dohs, banani, tejgaon, maghbazar, and motijheel.
orsaline price
as the summer heat continues to increase, more and more people are being affected by various waterborne diseases such as diarrhea, dysentery etc. a very effective way to meet water loss of the patients is to drink saline water. one of the most trusted medicines in this regard is the orsaline-n. but recently the retail price of this extremely essential medicine has been increased. one sachet of orsaline-n now costs tk 5 whereas only two months ago it was tk 3.
pull the trigger
bangladesh has huge potential to compete with the tiger economies in se, asia thanks to the large percentage of its young people. the question is who will pull the trigger?
dogmatism
when people place faith above the dignity of a human being they do not follow any religion. they follow a cult and a cult is controlled by a demon. when the former military dictator of pakistan, gen. zia ul huq, declared the ahmadiyya sect as non muslims, he violated a very basic form of human rights.
hijab and culture
i was watching a talk show broadcast by rtv channel on 13 april 2010. there were three journalists in the talk show.
power crisis and bnp
the power crisis was engineered and organised by the great bnp hero (or zero); the heir apparent himself, the anointed next ceo of the bnp! it was the power deal, which was made sour for an international company by the exposure, when the under the table deal came out in the american newspapers over the table! this international misdeed shied away power plant manufacturers from bidding for any bangladesh power projects, when the bnp ruled the roost.
vulnerability of bangladesh
bangladesh is located between the golden crescent to the west, comprising afghanistan, pakistan, and iran, and the golden triangle, to the east, comprising myanmar, laos, vietnam, and thailand. afghanistan remains the largest cultivator of poppy in the world. mayanmar is the world's second largest producer of illicit opium. but by far the most important drug threat for bangladesh is from india, most of india's brown sugar heroin comes from indian opium and is locally manufactured and transhifted to bangladesh, nepal, sri lanka, and the maldives. india produces methaqualone (mandrax) and psychotropic pharmaceuticals (loops). within the bordering localities of india there are a number of small, medium, or even large factories, producing phensidyl. those types of phensidyl are delivered easily into bangladesh. as a result, our youths are getting destroyed.
karwan or kawran ?
the above two names describe the same place of the city. but nobody seems to care about the accurate or correct name. most of the people spell it as kawran bazar, however, the media house that publishes the two dailies with the largest circulations, "prothom alo" and "the daily star" seems to prefer the former name. obviously, they have logic behind the use of a different spelling.
campus violence
campus violence is a matter of great concern for all of us. it is not only ruining the academic atmosphere but also claiming the lives of many promising students.
private tuition
the queue of secondary level students for private tuition towards either school teacher's house, or the coaching centre or both, is becoming longer day by day, while for each student at least one private tutor like a student of a college, university, or a teacher of school, college etc is being engaged and the number of private tutors varies according to the affordability of the parents.
provincial government
former president hussain mohammad ershad proposed to establish provincial government in bangladesh in a discussion meeting recently. he also unveiled a plan on it. i support his proposal as population in bangladesh is increasing rapidly. people come to dhaka regularly. most of them come here to get a job. as a result, dhaka has become a populous city. so, there is no alternative to establishing a provincial government. if the provincial government is established, we will get some amenities.
four-lane highway
a project like 4-lane dhaka - chittagong highway can bring many advantages if the authorities concerned pay due attention to it. the good news is that the construction work of a highway with 4 lanes between the capital city, dhaka and the port city will start soon. it is a very popular demand of the common people and the present government has taken the issue very seriously to complete the project before the end of the tenure. when completed, communication and transportation of commodities between the two important cities will be easier and it will help increase economic activities of the whole country. let us hope that the project will be complete as per the schedule.
