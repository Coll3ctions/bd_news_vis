bangladesh cricket saga
bangladesh cricket team has come back from the much-hyped icc world twenty20 championship in south africa with no feather added to its cap. except for a few flashes of individual brilliance, the performance as a team was anything but lacklustre, especially when a tournament like twenty20 demands the very best in all the departments. by ensuring a well-fought six-wicket victory over west indies, bangladesh reached the second round in style, thus raising hope in the minds of the countrymen. and this needs to be mentioned that the bangladesh team captain ashraful had even etched his name in the history book by scoring the fastest fifty in that match (which was however broken later by yuvraj singh of india). nevertheless, the general feeling among the cricket pundits was that the young side would add the expected spice to the tournament. unfortunately, it was not to come.

amoral code
when a coalition begins to melt, its partners subtly, if not silently, begin to shift their public agenda from common concern to individual need. the debate over the bridge built by lord ram between the tamil coast and sri lanka is hardly new. a year ago, the supreme leader of the dravida munnetra kazhagam, mr. m.k. karunanidhi, would not have fractured sensibilities nationwide with intemperate, unacceptable remarks about lord ram, revered and worshipped by hindus as the paradigm of virtue. view the page sports

bangladesh jute industry: time to rise to the occasion
when synthetics crowded out the demand for jute in international markets in the 70s, bangladesh's 'golden fibre' jute was believed to have been extinct. it was for a while until recently when demand for jute resurfaced in the global market, particularly in light of the environment-friendly and renewable nature of the product. a surge in global demand resuscitated exports of jute, both raw and products, from bangladesh. export of these two items increased by 120 percent and 40 percent respectively over the last six years. availability of superior grades of jute makes bangladesh well placed to enter and compete in export markets for high value-added and price-competitive jute products.

floodwater and tubewells

restoration of jute sector
it is a fact that once the strongest pillar of the bangladesh economy is now sinking fast and will soon become a part of history. there is a big conspiracy behind this sector's total destruction in bangladesh whereas its neighbour i.e. india and even napal are constructing new jute factories. in india old and closed factories are revived with raw jute being supplied from bangladesh. the closure of the biggest factory in asia i.e. adamjee and then subsequent closure of factories in khulna and other places is bringing unemployment and poverty to thousands of families.
modern day slavery!
it was quite astonishing for me to read in the magazine “bloomberg markets” about the existence of inhuman slavery still today in this modern civilised world. it was an investigative story in latin american countries like brazil and peru where people worked in timber, charcoal or gold mines without any wage and just for food. they work so hard and suffer from diseases like tb, malaria in amazonian forests and in unhygienic gold mines in peru that many of them embraced death at their early age. there is no authority to look into this matter. even the countries which boast of humanity and are beneficiaries of these mines, especially the usa, are not aware of the situation.
pakistan sceme

robbery
the frequency of robberies in the country is rising at an alarming rate. the police resources are not enough (plus poor service conditions).
politics, democracy and consumerism
politics has gone for a walk in the woods. where? in bangladesh? yes, and in other places too. the 21st century is slowly, but firmly, keeping its promise to change the shape of things that we were used to in the previous centuries. politicians all over the world either cautioned their citizens about the ferocity of changes that this century would bring or promised a "brave new world".
reaz rahman on shehabuddin book
please refer to syed badrul ahsan's review published in the daily star of 8 september 2007 of k.m. shehabuddin's book “there and back again. a diplomat's tale”. it has only recently been brought to my notice and therefore, this rejoinder.
terrorism and education
one of the most shocking terrorist attacks was launched on 9/11. this attack, by the islamic militants, not only took many innocent lives but also created a huge barrier for muslim students to getting access to higher education in the us. that is, they are deprived of higher education in the us and also in many other parts of the world.
working hours
at present, our national working hours (nwh) is 8 x 5= 40 hours per week. to speed up our development, we should increase the nwh and ensure complete utilistion of manpower. by increasing working hours, we can ensure massive participation in developmental works that will simultaneously remove unemployment problem and develop the country. the nwh could be increased to 12 hours per day (i.e. 12 x 5= 60 hours per week) where the workers and employees will work in two shifts. each of the shifts will be of 6 hours (8:00am to 2:00pm and 2:00pm to 8:00pm). such schedule may offer many advantages like-
biman issue
many readers write in your daily expressing their concern about the ailing national career, biman bangladesh airlines. the common feeling is that biman should be turned into a profit-making airline. but how? one point that has never come up for discussion is that biman has lost its goodwill in aviation market. in business if your goodwill and prestige is destroyed you stand nowhere. biman's reputation in business deals with aircraft suppliers has eroded so badly that no one is willing to come forward and help. in the last decade or so, biman has floated on several occasions tenders for strategic partners and aircraft lease/charter but the response has been very poor. this is ample proof that biman has lost its creditability in the aviation industry. this is not the end. the story goes that on many occasions biman even failed to pay on time handling charges at overseas airports and its flights were barred from taking off till the dues were cleared.
textile engineering institute
the low investment, low technology and labour intensive garments industry has developed tremendously well in the last two decades in bangladesh. huge demand of production ingredients like, knit & woven fabric, button, jeepers, level and packing materials, created scope for backward linkage industrial units. a good number of industrial units have been set up by the sponsors in the last couple of years to cater to the demand of the garments industry, especially yarn producing spinning factories, fabric producing factories, processing, dying and washing plants have come up and created jobs for the people. but these backward linkage industrial units are confronting shortage of technical experts in textile technology.
caretaker government
it is true that most of the people are happy with the present caretaker government's anti-corruption drive and various measures taken to curb crime. nevertheless, it is also true that an interim government like the present one cannot be a total & complete solution of the problem bangladesh is riddled with.
special economic zone
bangladesh has had a good record in a number of macroeconomic indicators, but alas, when it comes to attracting large-scale investment, its record is wretched. so far, bangladesh has been experimenting with export processing zones for quite some time to attract investment. the county has had some success in attracting small-scale investments, mainly in the textile sector. the largest investment has been the construction of the fertiliser factory on the banks of the river karnaphuli. other than that, no other company made any significant investment. recently, some large international companies have shown keen interest to invest in bangladesh, but an apathetic attitude by the government has discouraged a number of those investors. something needs to be done to encourage large-scale investment in bangladesh, and the only way to do so seems to be the establishment of a special economic zone (sez) in bangladesh. large-scale investment can help in employing a large number of people, establish ancillary industries, increase economic growth and provide new technology to bangladesh.
coaching centres
the students of many schools and colleges are totally dependent on coaching centres. this is a bad sign for our future education. the guardians of the students are seen to admit their children in the coaching centres. the guardians should realise what the real purpose of education is.
market economy
today's fascination with market economy has created dominating and dominated economies and weak economies are being trapped in the process of marginalisation. no country is economically safe in the face of stiff competition. so it is imperative to become proactive or reactive or at least protective, but protective strategy will no longer be effective. protective economies that are lagging behind the race of economic integration are becoming more vulnerable to dominating economies. in this scenario of world economy, a country like bangladesh should be strategically solvent and it's a ray of hope that the new york based investment banking organisation goldman sachs has rated bangladesh as one of the next eleven potential countries after brazil, russia, india and china (bric) which will influence the world economy. view the page international
