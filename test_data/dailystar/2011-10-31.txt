voters spoke eloquently for the best
congratulations to selina hayat ivy on her magnificent victory. the highly charged narayanganj city corporation polls, stalked by intense rivalry between candidates and controversy over political party backing ended with the nation heaving a sigh of relief. as the stakes went high for all concerned and all kinds of foreboding rent the air, the dramatic note of success it has concluded on fills the nation with a sense of collective triumph.
reluctant registration of complaints
it is unbelievable but true that the police in the various police stations of the metropolis are being very selective in registering complaints and instituting cases on those. as reported in a national bangla daily, it has received complaints from as many as hundred people in the last three months to the effect that the police have refused to record their complaints which included alleged rape, abduction, attempted murder, extortion, wrongful confinement and various other grave felony. in certain instances people had to pay under the table to have their complaint filed. and some of the aggrieved had to record the case directly in the lower court. we wonder what has happened to the much vaunted help desk in the police stations. view the page sports

khilgaon flyover
khilgaon flyover has been kept off limit for heavy vehicles causing severe traffic congestion under the flyover at khilgaon rail crossing. this situation has been continuing since the publication of some reports in the daily newspapers that the khilgaon flyover has developed cracks. thereafter, several teams from buet, dhaka city corporation and lged inspected the flyover and reported that these faults which appeared to be cracks were neither due to faulty design nor they were posing any serious threat to the flyover.
tale of a slum kid
the other day at farmgate i came across a boy selling newspaper to a man who was sitting in his car. the man handed him a ten taka note and the boy did not have change. so, the man started to scold the boy and at one point he got out of the car and beat up the poor boy. nobody said anything or came forward to save the boy. as i was shocked at how cruel people have become to the underprivileged children, i stood beside him and asked him his whereabouts. he was an eight-year-old boy named shujon. i also enquired about his parents and he said, “my father had left us and married another woman. my mother is sick and doesn't do anything.” shujon is second among his five siblings; he lives in a slum at mohammadpur. whatever insignificant profits he makes out of selling newspapers, he gives it to his mother so that she can run the family. although he had always wanted to go to school, he never had the chance to attend one. shujon and children like him struggle for survival every single day. theirs is an insurmountable battle, beginning from the very day they are born. if we are really unable to help them, we can still love them and show them sympathy.
hero now being upon as a villain!
nowadays road accidents have become a very common issue in our country. we all know that most of the accidents occur due to the competitive attitude of the drivers. in bangladesh, there are lots of drivers who do not know the traffic rules but have driving licenses. the helpers always embarrass the passengers. we have lost some renowned personalities in road accidents. even ilias kanchan, who has been fighting for road safety since his wife's tragic death in a road crash, has become a villain to the drivers. now the drivers are trying to prove that they are innocent. i think if the brta does not take necessary steps, then the brta officials may also lose their relatives soon due to road accident.

two city corporations in dhaka!
dhaka city corporation has been split into two - south city corporation and north city corporation for two mayoral posts, but for whose benefit?
use of evm
use of electronic voting machine (evm) is a widely discussed issue in narayanganj city corporation election. the evm is going to be used for the first time in narayanganj city corporation election 2011 for 145000 voters. the ec is trying to digitalise the voting system by using evm denying the public opinion against it. the electronic voting system was recently rejected in india and not highly accepted even in the first world countries. all the mayoral candidates of narayanganj including the ruling party supported candidate shamim osman have opposed the use of evm. but ec is trying to use this system forcefully. many illiterate voters still do not understand the analogue system of voting, but they will have to use digital voting machine. moreover, the main allegation against the evm is that it does not provide recount facility in case any doubt arises. so, i think the ec should turn back to analogue voting system respecting people's opinion.
discourage teenage smokers
it hurts when we see many teenagers in dhaka have become smokers and they do not bother to smoke in public places. everybody knows the bad effects of smoking. most of the cigarette sellers in bangladesh are teenagers who usually get addicted to smoking. that day while i was having my evening walk, i found a young boy, aged around 11 or 12, smoking at the corner of a lake. i could not bear the sight as he was too young to smoke, and asked him to throw away the cigarette at once. the next day when i was walking, he came forward and greeted me and proudly said that he gave up smoking. i don't know whether it was true, but we should strictly speak to the teen smokers whenever we see them smoking. ban on smoking in public places may play a big role in persuading the teens not to become smokers.
teachers' status
as per the government decision the directorate of secondary and higher education has recently appointed as many as 1377 assistant teachers in the secondary level for the double-shift schools. regrettably, a number of them have not joined their jobs. perhaps they have got better jobs elsewhere. it is clear that talented and capable young people are not at all interested in this profession due to lack of both respect and good pay. that's why the teachers of government. high schools have been demanding first class status for a long time. teaching is an honourable profession. teachers are the torchbearers, mentors and leaders of a nation. but honestly speaking, teachers are not well-treated in our country. i would like to request our present government and the authorities concerned to address the issue.
