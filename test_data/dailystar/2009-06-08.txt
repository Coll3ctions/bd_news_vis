bnp's persistence over seat issue
the opposition bangladesh nationalist party has since the convening of the ninth jatiyo sangsad been whipping up a storm over seating arrangements in the house. the party held a series of meetings with speaker abdul hamid, who for his part appears to have gone the extra mile to accommodate it. in fact, after the recent bye-elections, he rearranged the seating in a way that could accommodate such senior bnp leaders as moudud ahmed and jamiruddin sircar. that does not seem to have mollified the bnp, which has continued to demand seats in the front row beyond what its numbers in the js allow it. indeed, the five seats the party now has on the front bench are in excess of the numbers it is entitled to in the house.

the nation in the line of 'crossfire'

budget suggestions
the current global crisis has sounded the death-knell of market fundamentalism. strong regulatory systems must be in place in all countries to ensure effective market governance. moreover, it has to be realised that there is a need for a strong and effective state to redistribute income in favour of the exploited common people and to rein in the predatory whims of the rich and powerful in the society.
perpetuating political corruption
it's increasingly becoming a tradition that if opposition politicians are charged for illegitimate personal gains through bribery, extortion, cronyism, nepotism, patronage, graft, tax evasion, and embezzlement by the party in power, their cases can be tossed out on considerations of being politically motivated when the aggrieved party returns to power. view the page sports

exciting cricket
the second twenty20 world cup began in england with the opening ceremony taking place at the lord's in london - the home of cricket - on 05/06/09. it is apt that the country which invented the "gentleman's game", including the exciting 20-over format known as twenty20, would host this tournament. if the last t20 world cup, hosted by south africa, culminating in the nail-biting final between the asian powerhouses india and pakistan, is anything to go by, this year's event also promises to be a spectacular one. the twenty20 format of the game has evolved rapidly since the inaugural world cup and is now the fastest growing sporting competition in the world. the success of the indian premier league (ipl) has provided great publicity regarding this sport, however, it could well be argued that the increasing popularity of t20 is at the expense of the 50-over version of the odi game or the traditional five-day test matches, rather than other competing sports.
encroachment on water bodies
i am reading all these articles on encroachment on water bodies along with pathetic excuses from government bodies, but will any real action be taken? i was surprised and pleased to see the ctg take on some high ups and free a lot of land in gulshan, so it isn't just a pipe dream, anything is possible. apart from our rivers, our lakes are still being encroached upon. on one side of gulshan lake, they are extending the boundary pavement as i write this and yet on the badda side of the lake they are encroaching another few feet every few months! do the lawmakers not see that the lake has another side other than gulshan? or are they turning a blind eye because they have a vested interest?
icon of democracy
our next-door myanmar is a mysterious country, which has been ruled for decades by the military junta. most of the countries in the world have snapped relations with this undemocratic country, albeit china supports it unanimously. russia sells their arms and india also keeps good relations considering the economic perspective.
deforestation
some people do not try to realise the importance of trees. they cut trees at random. this way, due to deforestation carbon dioxide is increasing worldwide. as a result, the world is becoming warmer. the sea level is rising and many parts of the world are going to be engulfed by the sea in near future. on the other hand, new areas of the world are turning into deserts because of deforestation. the removal of trees causes birds and other animals living on them to leave the place. it also causes serious damage to the soil, as trees give protection to soil as well. in the end, the soil gets sediment in the riverbed and causes frequent floods. so, if we destroy trees at random, one day the country will turn into a great desert. the living animals and birds will not find any food or shelter to live in. they will be destroyed. there will be no rain and consequently our agriculture will face a great crisis.
digital bangladesh
the above topic seems to be the talk of the town; in drawing rooms, audio-visual and the print media in recent days. the news seems to be the "holy grail" for all the problems we have! it will gives us the promise for the possibility of a sort of 360degree, 24x7 openness and transparency of interaction with most public issues; practically bringing the governance to the computer website and the mobile phone in a reasonable time frame, if my analysis is rational.

ipo applications
various problems are being faced by individual or small investors in obtaining or getting information about refunds to unsuccessful ipo applications, viz.
media and collective thinking
the media is currently involved in generating public awareness on two vital issues- the prothom alo has launched a motivational programme as "bodle jao- badle dao"; and the daily star with channel i has put on the air a live programme : 'nodi bachao-desh bachao".
crossfire killings
the frankenstein has been let loose. two innocent polytechnic boys are the latest victims. the government's election pledge is ignored. ministers are expressing contradicting views. we are living in such a savage society that many of us even enjoy such annihilation. we have lost our faith in the normal process of criminal justice, but pretend to believe the stories of 'crossfire' and 'encounters'. executive magistrates in their inquiries endorsed all the killings. then where will the people go?
rab
the period of caretaker govt was more or less peaceful with crime rate at the lowest level. why? reports said it was the fear of getting killed in the 'crossfire' of rab that forced diehard criminals to flee the country or hole themselves up in underground sanctuaries. even jailed criminals did not dare to seek bail. this fact clearly indicates how beneficial rab was for the common people and what a terror it was for the criminals. now those who advocate for the dissolution of rab are no doubt supporting the criminals. it is our misfortune that our politics has been hijacked by such people as cannot think of their existence without the active support of musclemen, goons and thugs. after all, what else could assure them of immense power to trample law as well as daily huge 'income' without investing a paisa? so . . . abolish rab and let the common people go to hell.
gandhian non-violence
when mahatma gandhi launched his non-violent movement to end the british colonial rule in india, he made it clear why he rejected all calls for a violent freedom struggle: "if indians take up guns to kill the british, given india's great ethnic and religious divisions, they would still be using the same guns to kill each long after the british had gone. i don't want india's freedom if it meant indians would be free to slaughter each other. if india makes violence her creed, i will not care to live in india."similarly, israel has vacated gaza, but hamas and fatah are still slaughtering each other. in the fight for control of gaza, hamas was accused by human rights watch of "violation of international humanitarian laws in some cases amounting to war crimes."
media and ministers
the national probe report on the bdr mutiny raised objections about role of the media in disseminating information during the mutiny. but it did not say anything about the comments of the ministers about the different “links of mutiny” just after the massacre took place. the national probe report did not find any such link. the media was giving true information but the ministers' comments were based on speculations and political motivation. moreover, the comments might influence the investigations by different agencies. the report recommended formulation of a code of conduct for the media, specifying their role in consolidating national security. but why did it not recommend such code of conduct for the ministers?
primary education
after assuming power, the awami league government is considering expanding primary education up to grade viii. we know that all the primary schools are now up to grade v and most of the schools are government schools, while the secondary education is just the opposite, most of the secondary schools are non-government.
river pollution
i sincerely thank the daily star for its efforts in getting attention of public to water pollution and river grabbing!
no campus violence!
i feel very proud as i am a student of khulna university (ku). ku has a good reputation, because it is the only university in bangladesh where student politics is fully prohibited on the campus. so, we do not experience any campus violence. that's why we, the students of ku, can complete our undergraduate & postgraduate programmes in time without any problem. on the other hand, the students of jahangirnagar university, jagannath university, chittagong university, rajshhi university, even dhaka university, suffer due to session jam. view the page international
