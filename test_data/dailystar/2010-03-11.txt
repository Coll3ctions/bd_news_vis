pro-farmer banking system
the recent initiative of bangladesh bank (bb) to allow farmers to open an account at commercial banks by depositing just tk.10 is indeed laudable. a country, where pretty much seventy-five percent of the population lives by cultivation and farming, can't afford to stick to the orthodox banking system. an innovative and pro-poor approach is needed to ensure at least a modest life for them. i salute bb for taking a pro-poor approach that many had never thought of before, or had the courage to start.
