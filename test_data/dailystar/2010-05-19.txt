sangbad at sixty
sixty years ago, the daily sangbad made its appearance in what was then east bengal/east pakistan. it was a time when the earliest indications of an emerging bengali nationalism were to be detected. sangbad, however, was not quite disposed to such causes in its initial stages, which again was quite understandable given the prevailing nature of politics at the time. and yet a moment came when sangbad made that crucial choice of going for a defence of the cause of the bengali people, a cause that not only focused on the need for a greater say in the politics of pakistan for them but also on the necessity of a preservation of the heritage that underscored the bengali social psyche. by the 1960s, it was sangbad that was informing people insistently that the rights of the people of east bengal could only be ignored at risk to the very state itself. view the page sports

mother's day
like many other countries, we too definitely observe this day. we have huge responsibility towards our mothers. but, many of us still do not understand the significance of motherhood. if we could understand it, then why is a female child still unwanted ? why a mother is tortured to death for the “guilt” of giving birth to a female child? it is also shocking that while killing the wife for dowry, a person forgets that his wife is also the mother of a child. i also do not understand why does a son become eager to send his mother to an old home? throughout the whole life, a mother runs after her children. why can't we look after them in their old age? there are many people living abroad who cannot manage time to come back to their motherland to visit their mothers. there are also men who do not hesitate to shift his mother from bedroom to storeroom or corridor.
rental power
dr. abdul matin, a former chief engineer of bangladesh atomic energy commission, wrote an article in the daily star on may 5, 2010 on the government's policy of going for rental power for an interim solution of the present power crisis. he has convincingly explained that it is an unwise decision of the government to go for rental power contracts ranging from three to five years as rental power is traditionally used for short periods during an emergency or as a standby power source for big events, like olympics.
micro finance and other issues
that micro finance should have the total responsibility to alleviate poverty is the notion of some people. if they ever talk about poverty; they like to confer all the responsibility of poverty alleviation on micro finance. this is not rational.
gitanjali
it has touched 100 years of its publication. the nobel prize winning book was published in 1910.
fuel shortage
having no liquid fuel, bangladesh has to import it of necessity. finite natural gas (methane) reserves are getting reduced day by day. meanwhile, proven and possible resources of methane, remain unexplored even today! coal is there, but we do not extract it, except from one mine-- for so many reasons (or excuses)! in the case of extraction of coal, we ideally define the saying: "poverty in the land of plenty"! we are shying away from it, be it by shaft or surface mining, while the debate on the subject has continued on and on!
power generation
your staff correspondent's front-page report of may 11th. stated about the "whitening of white money" by khaleda zia! however the statement from an nbr official was otherwise! he stated, and i quote:
shashi shines brilliantly
our heartiest congratulations to farzana saki shashi from bhairab, kishoreganj, for becoming the second runners-up jointly with drokrishnendu in mirakkel- 5, a show arranged by zee bangla. its last episode was on may 8, 2010.
dowry
dowry, a social disease, cannot be cured fully by laws only, rather creating mass awareness among rural people is needed.
importing films
this is in reference to our prime minister banning sub-continental films in bangladesh which seems to have been welcomed by many people. i however beg to differ. this also bans our freedom and our right to choose what we want to watch considering the fact that we live in a free country.
order of precedence
even in these days of disrespect and disregard, the society still maintains a special position and admiration for the varsity professors because they impart education at the highest seat of learning, that is, the university. but in order of precedence at the national level, the professors have not been given their just status and accreditation. often they get into embarrassing situations.
mpo list
the recent decision taken by the cabinet regarding the acceptance of mpo list is really controversial as the education minister has already finalised the draft, after a long analysis and consideration. it again proves that political partisanship is prevailing in the country and that is one of the hindrances to walking on the way to progress. in a least developed country like bangladesh, education plays the pivotal role for the continuous development of the nation. so, our prime minister has to handle this issues overcoming all political considerations to take the right decision for enlisting the institutions. education is a basic need and the present govt has to give right priority to the education sector.
travelling by train
along with two other friends of mine, i decided to travel to sylhet for some specific business purpose and considering the hassles in road journey, i bought the upaban express first class ticket for 3 may, 2010. the train was scheduled to depart at 9:45pm. when we arrived at the station we saw a first class waiting room without any air-conditioning. there was a ceiling fan at one side of the room. the furniture were dirty, poorly maintained and occupied by the passengers or some other people who were not passengers of the first class. the washroom was equally dirty. for reasons not known, there was none to take care or check the tickets of the passengers or even clean the room. having the entitlement yet we had to stroll out all the time instead.
working overtime
recently, the european medical journal published that people working 10 or 11 hours a day are more likely to have serious heart problems, including heart attacks, than those clocking off after seven hours. the finding, from an 11-year study of 6,000 british civil servants, does not provide definitive proof that long hours cause coronary heart disease but it does show a clear link, which experts said may be due to stress.
prioritising civility
after suggesting that the powers of the acc be curbed, i wonder whether the government is trying to promote a culture of being polite instead of pursuing justice. what other reason could they possibly have to justify such an unbelievably ludicrous protocol of asking for the government's permission before pressing corruption charges against bureaucrats? by attempting to strip away the powers of the country's leading anti-corruption authority against severe public displeasure, our leaders have once again made us realize that we, the people, are simply the means to an end; the pawns they need in support of their demagoguery so that they can get elected to public office. after all, does it really matter that bangladesh is continually labelled as one of the most corrupt countries in the world today? why not maintain that title and ask for permission from our leaders before possibly suggesting that they, too, are bound by the same laws as the rest of the people in the country?
textile workers' strike
manipulation and syndication are the major obstacles for the government to maintain price level of any item, be they industrial raw materials, daily essentials, food items, life-saving drugs etc. stock market manipulation is a daily affair, for instance. we know the government is unable to apprehend pre-emptively on market reaction on any item, so it should have regular and constant watchdogs to monitor those sectors.
public or private?
we are the students of jagannath university. about 23,000 students are studying here. the students of jagannath university bear the identity of public university. instead of giving the facilities of a public university, such as, students' dormitory, exam halls, required classrooms etc, the authorities of jagannath university are taking the initiative to make it private. the so called “ black section” 27(4) demands that a university will run with its own income which is impossible and it is nothing but a lame excuse. view the page international
