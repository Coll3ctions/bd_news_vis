khaleda's threat to bring down the government
frankly, begum zia's call to bring down the government has taken us by surprise. we are dismayed by her impatience to go back to power. it has been only sixteen months that the government has been in authority and certainly many of its policies merit criticism, but to seek a change in government through agitation at this point in time is bound to create a sense of uncertainty in people's mind. nevertheless, her statements deserve consideration, come as they do from none other than the leader of the opposition.
murders in the city
six individuals were murdered in separate incidents in the city on saturday. that is surely worrying, though there will be people who will suggest that such crimes have generally been the reality not only in this country but elsewhere as well. one does not argue against that kind of argument. but the truth about the six murders in question is something pretty disturbing in nature. and it is that of late criminal incidents in the capital and elsewhere have been on the rise. that points to a couple of facts. one is that criminality seems to be acquiring a degree of impunity that can only make citizens concerned about their safety. the other is that it shows that the police are not only unable to keep our streets and homes safe but that they are also ill-equipped to track down the elements responsible for such crimes. view the page sports
