death of a trader
the tragic death of a trader in bangshal raises some very important questions. sabed hasan, former president of bangladesh motorcycle parts merchants association, died on friday after falling from the first floor of his home while trying to evade arrest by the police. it is here that the story gets murky and raises once again questions about the role of the police in the difficulties citizens have lately run into. with reports of individuals dying in police custody recently making the rounds, it makes sense to ask why the police in bangshal were trying to arrest sabed hasan at 1 a.m. indeed, that there was a noticeable keenness among the police to nab the trader is made manifest by the fact that soon after a case was filed against him by the present president of the traders' association, the police went looking for him.

bulbul ahmed's passing
veteran actor bulbul ahmed has left us forever. it is shocking news for all cinema lovers of bangladesh. this death would definitely create a huge vacuum in the cultural arena of our country. he possessed a unique personality. he was a perfect gentleman.
tigers strike again
the win against england during the second odi was indeed a great achievement and finally came after a long time. i believe our new wicketkeeper did a wonderful job behind the stumps and should be made a full time wicketkeeper. this will enable mushfiqur rahim to concentrate entirely on his batting. md. ashraful is not making any contribution to his team and should be dropped permanently. he seems to have forgotten how to play cricket. i also urge the bangladesh cricket team to be hungrier for winning and not let the opposition just walk all over them. this is exactly what they did during the third odi and it was not pleasant to watch. i feel that they should always fight till the end. the umpires also made some wrong decisions and ought to be scrutinized. i urge them to take a little time to analyse their decisions before lifting their finger. i would like to also urge shakib al-hassan and abdur razzak to bowl as straight as possible. if the ball strays to the leg side, then it becomes very easy for the batsman to hit the ball hard. on the whole, i feel it is time the tigers stopped being minnows or underdogs.

having lost all the matches in asia cup by huge margins, many of us back home thought bangladesh would face a tougher challenge against england in their home ground. after losing the first one-dayer, the tigers bounced back in the second match winning it by 5 runs, thanks mainly to their spinners and an all round display by captain mashrafe mortaza. with that victory, the tigers now had the great feeling of winning against all the test playing nations in the limited version of the game.
kuakata tourist spot
kuakata is gradually attracting an increased number of tourists. it's a spectacular beach where one can have a sight of both the rising and setting sun. i have the experience of visiting patong and rawai beaches in thailand. i found kuakata not less attractive than those beaches. this is also a place from where tourists can visit the sundarbans world's largest mangrove forests. some private tour operators are already offering tour programmes.
higher education
recently, the hsc results were published across the country with more than 1.5 percent increase in percentage of passing compared to the previous year. however, many of them have come out with outstanding success scoring gpa-5. but the shocking news for those students is that all of them cannot get admission in good universities.
tourism potential of sylhet
sylhet division is known for natural beauty. there are opportunities to focus on its beauty. these natural sceneries attract bangladeshi people as well as foreigners. it is a matter of regret that such places lost their appeal due to lack of proper care.
a boy of vision!
it was a very worthwhile initiative taken by a class ten student, krishna jaldas, living in a fishing village in mirersarai, where there are no primary schools within a few miles of the village! he has opened a school for teaching basic literacy in the yard in front of his hut!
higher education in uk
i completed my bba from north south university. after completing my graduation, i decided to apply to some well-reputed uk universities for my masters. upon applying, i've got a few unconditional offers as well as cas to study masters in well-reputed uk universities (for instance: essex university, coventry university, university of hull). most of the courses will commence in the last week of september.
winning by chance!
there are two expressions -- by chance and by choice. bangladesh wins in cricket by chance.
bcl and al leaders
al leaders are speaking their minds. one of them disowned chattra league's wanton barbarism all over the country. another frank and blunt leader expressed the whole truth that instead of wasting energy through infighting, the chhatra league should take on the opposition which, he hinted, will greatly complement the government's repressive action against the people. actually, the al wants a bangladesh where everybody will support whatever they do.
bnp and tarique
i have gone through the above captioned letter written by dr. shameem of new dhs, dhaka on 14 july. i agree with him that it is an opportunity for the bnp to bring their 'rising sun of the east' out clean by winning the legal battle. not only this money laundering case which the ctg started against him, there are many more stories and gossips against tarique which need to be cleared from the public knowledge. the bnp reportedly believe that mr. tarique zia is a talented future leader of bangladesh who will be able to lead his country in the right direction.
sex education
issues like rape, sexual abuse of boys and girls, std/aids, abortions, etc., need to be addressed urgently. for this, it is important to make our children aware of what sex is. they have to get proper information on it. a curriculum that will not offend the sensibilities of bangladeshis should include the scientific, social, and religious aspects of sex. not all parents can discuss sex openly with their children. the school environment is ideal. moreover, notwithstanding the recent study on child abuse, i believe that the solution for it does not lie in sex education. it lies in imparting moral values and handing out severe punishment to the perpetrators of crimes against children. sex education will not help in preventing perversion. what is actually needed is the revival of moral science as a compulsory subject from class x. lessons on good habits, duties of the individual to the family, society and the country and so on can be included in the syllabus. it is only by strengthening the moral values and character of individuals that a society can be saved from human predators. so, let us concentrate on educating the adults.
freedom lovers or bigots?
the approval by france's lower house of parliament to ban islamic veil shows once again what a bunch of hypocrites these “liberated” people are. justice minister michele alliot-marie said it was a victory for democracy and freedom against all the oppressions. oh really? ms marie's comments would make more sense if they were made in afghanistan against the talibans. these comments are totally inappropriate for women who are living in france which is a fully independent, democratic, nuclear-capable, un veto-holding, freedom-loving and peace-loving country!

dr. kamal hossain
on 14 july sba's “of kamal hossain...of what might have been” was interesting. a man like kamal hossain could not shine in our political sky!! there are many reasons someone can point out.
a train journey
believe it or not. one can go to dhaka from uttara with only tk 6 as travelling cost and comparatively within a short time. this was absurd to me till i travelled from airport railway station to kamalapur station by rail on 13 july at a cost of tk 6 only.
kuwaiti visa
currently, (probably for a year or so), the kuwait government is not issuing any work permit or visa to any bangladeshi national in any category. it is worthwhile to mention that the bilateral relation between kuwait and bangladesh was always good since the independence of bangladesh in 1971. as far as i know, bangladesh imports most of its petroleum from kuwait. on the other hand, thousands of bangladeshi nationals are working in kuwait at the moment. most of them are workers and labourers. they are playing a great role in the gdp of kuwait. during the gulf war back in late 80's and early 90's, bangladeshi workers played a big role in the reconstruction of kuwait. at that time all other foreign workers, except bangladeshis escaped due to the war.
the stark reality!
bangladesh is the 8th largest country in the world in population where 150 million people are virtually elbowing each other in a land that is 134,000 sq km in area with a population density of more than 1100 people per sq km. overpopulated! during independence in 1971, the population of bangladesh was about 75 million. after 39 years, its population is more than doubled. the current estimate of population growth in the country is 1.75% a year. this means that the population of bangladesh will double in the next 40 years. in spite of such an ominous situation, idealists may be quick to point out that bangladesh is making improvements in education and healthcare, and most importantly has achieved a respectable economic growth rate of about 5 per cent a year in recent decades. though true, such progress has had a very little impact on the overall poverty level in the country. studies reveal that in real terms the poverty level in bangladesh has not come down but gone up. the main reason for this incongruity is the rapid growth of the country's underprivileged population, whose unemployment rate remains extremely high for illiteracy. since the poor uneducated people have no steady income, they customarily want more children as security and support in old age. they are also apt to get married early and produce children that they can't educate or even support. however, the great irony is that the children born in such a situation tend to breed more of the same year after year. this is precisely what's happening in bangladesh right now. the stark reality is that such a growth in population will not only put the future of bangladesh in serious danger, it will indubitably have a profound impact on the rest of the world as well.

“inception”: a heady thriller of mind games and mystery
“inception,” the science fiction thriller by writer-director christopher nolan that easily qualifies as the most highly anticipated movie of the summer, opens with a dramatic shot of huge waves breaking onto a nameless shore. and that image suggests the best way to watch a film with such a tightly coiled plot, cerebral conceits and formidable ambition. rather than trying to game out “inception” on first viewing, it's best to let it wash over you, and save the head-scratching and inevitable talmudic interpretations for later.
