our urban future
dhaka is growing at a pace that services and infrastructure are unable to cope with. from energy to transport and water - all that a city relies on for its survival are stretched past the breaking point, as existing provisions are insufficient to meet the burgeoning demand. looking closely, one cannot ignore the fact that we got to this point by our collective and wilful blindness to the negative impacts of unregulated and unplanned urban development. buildings, the primary unit of habitation and organization of a city, are one of the key contributing factors to the woes of today's urban life.

thoughts on the nation's economy
let me begin this review by being facetious. every time i come across the somber-sounding term “leading issues” i am tempted to wonder whether they are really leading, or, if they are, what are they leading to, or if they are misleading, or why should they, and not other factors, be considered leading, or whether the issues are anointed with the tag of “leading” to serve and/or advance someone's personal or institutional agenda. therefore, with some trepidation, i leafed through the 300-plus pages of leading issues in bangladesh development, and although, admittedly, the going was not always smooth (more my problem in comprehending easily all that has been written than the authors' expertise in presenting them), i have come away convinced that some serious issues requiring serious attention regarding bangladesh's development have been covered in the book. the editor, sadiq ahmed, invited eight contributors (including himself) to shed light on “these contemporary issues and challenges in a comprehensive yet succinct manner.” as with many anthologies, the essays in this volume are not of uniform quality, but, overall, they analyze some critical issues and suggest ways of successfully tackling their ailments, although, regrettably, a few fall into the trap of offering a huge plethora of panaceas that might appear impressive on paper, but would be difficult to implement in practice in their entirety.
