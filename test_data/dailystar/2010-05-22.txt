pukur, godhuli bela and remarkable lives
william dalrymple, a household name in our part of the world, makes an arduous journey to construct stories taken from life, some of which are bizarre, some heart-rending, some with a blend of political ideology and some others being simple descriptions of occupations handed down from generation to generation where concerns about the changing patterns of life adopted by their offspring threaten the adults' age-old customs and culture. this job of the writer is no less arduous than the treks he makes through the length and breadth of the region. his tenacity in narrating the tales of nine lives has been most rewarding to his readers as it has charted new vistas by unwinding stories hitherto unknown. the protagonists' utterances about their own lives in detail and unreservedly, of course, elicited by the questions of the author, make each story distinctly unique. here one cannot but appreciate the authenticity inherent in their narratives as they pour their hearts out to the author. and for this, all credit goes to the writer because his total involvement with them not primarily as a writer but as a person with all human qualities helped establish a rapport failing which there would not have been any stories with a human face. in one of the appreciations of this book, dalrymple has been described as one of the 'greatest storytellers' of 'one of the world's greatest storytelling cultures', that is, india. true, but it would rather have been a more befitting description of him if it had said that he has been a most unusually engaging listener and collector of stories. storytelling is natural to him because he is a writer who travels a lot and is keen on knowing people in a holistic manner. rather the people in this book have been marvellous storytellers that in turn made him a seasoned storyteller. in the introduction, the author draws readers' attention to the contrasts in his methodology used in this book with the one that he adopted in both from the holy mountain and in xanadu where the narrator's role was much more pronounced than those of the people. dalrymple states that he has reversed this method and by doing so, he has brought the subjects from the background to the fore. and it is precisely this quality in nine lives that has made every story glimmer in its own style and content.

of family values
most often what we see as 'the end' of a story does not always draw a proper end. a new journey begins with another story. similarly, in the novel the english teacher, krishna, who is the english teacher in the albert mission college, goes through a journey of life that does not end with the end of the story. it seems like a very ordinary story but often the extraordinary incidents take birth from the ordinary story. this autobiographical novel written by r. k. narayan is based on this theme.
