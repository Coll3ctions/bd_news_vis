dying rivers
i would like to pay my heartfelt thanks to ds for its sincere efforts to save the rivers as well as to save the nation from imminent ruination due to the situation created by the unscrupulous and greedy people living around dhaka city. the ds has made a very good move to alert the sleeping people and the organisations concerned of the government. the foreshore land is the land lying between the high & low water mark of ordinary spring tide. the spring tide is happening during the full moon and the new moon period of the lunar month. besides, 50 yards =150 ft from the high water mark is also under the control of biwta. if any one wants to make any temporary structures on the foreshore land and up to 50 yards from the foreshore line, then they must seek permission of biwta. but it is observed along the rivers buriganga, shitalakhya, turag, dhaleswari, balu and tongi khal that huge numbers of structures have been constructed and installed within foreshore land and within 50 yards of the foreshore lands. for this illegal encroachments and grabbing mainly the district administration, land authorities and some employees of biwta are responsible and they should be brought to book. those who served during the last 10 to 20 years should be summoned to explain everything.

no power for three days!
can you believe this? there was no electricity in my home [mohammedpur (north), chittagong] for three days! wapda (pdb whatever) people say there is a problem with the transformer. but this is not the first time! the transformer down is a very usual event in this area. it happens at least twice a week. and we need to spend night after night without electricity. you can't imagine the agony of spending such a night in this hot summer. my eldest brother and his wife have severe jaundice; we had to shift her to another place due to the electricity problem. recently, my father had a heat stroke, and has been hospitalised for almost a week and when he was released the electricity was gone.
boring talk shows
some talk shows are becoming a big source of irritation to a few for being monotonous, and the missing principles of presenting a view point, especially when the moderator is heavily involved in pushing his or her view point. therefore, my simple question is; who decides how the talk show should be organised and presented- the sponsor, the producer or tv authorities or the moderator? this is basically a policy question put to the authorities of the tv channels airing the talk shows. as a viewer, i think we have the right to talk about using and misusing the electronic media.

freedom at stake
our freedom is at stake for sure. if the people/citizens do not get protection and feel safe in their own homes, then who can say we are a free country? when the clock turned to midnight of june 11 a television channel reportedly showed their muscle power and tried to evict the original resident out of his 69 gulshan avenue home. what a shame, why they had to show muscle power and why at night if they did rightfully buy the land from the owner?
look into it
high drama was staged in occupying/liberating wtcc, the lone organisation that regulates internal movement of goods through river routes. the organisation was created to co ordinate the interests of both ship owners and importers and smooth movement of goods. chittagong chambers represented the importers, bcvoa and coab represented the ship owners. during the 4 party rule of the bnp/jamaat, a section of corrupt officials occupied the leadership of wtcc and plundered crores of taka. after the 1/11 change over some of them confessed their guilt and returned some of the money so plundered. others fled away to foreign countries to save their skins. newspapers published a number of stories about wtcc corruption. now these interest groups assembled again behind different political activists to start their nefarious activities. bcvoa and coab leaderships are supposed to be elected bodies but democracy is a far cry there. interested coteries occupied leadership and never face election. ordinary ship owners have no voice in these organisations.
law minister's comment
the law minister barrister shafique ahmed has reportedly commented that the acc could not work freely during the ctg rule. and immediately barrister moudud ahmed supported his comments and declared his intention to cooperate with the law minister for initiating actions against ctg and acc. the comments are not true and mr. moudud's quick offer of assistance to the law minister is an attempt to discredit the
demolition of structures
it is good to see that the govt. is evicting the illegal structures on turag and shitalakhya rivers. but it is disappointing that some religious installations were spared. the authorities hesitated to demolish those on the ground of "religious sentiments"!
budget
the budget of 2009-10 is more significant than any other budget. we have got a timeworn budget after two years. it is well-known that the budget means some changes. moreover, people should have the willingness to keep pace with such kind of changes. this budget will be effective and acceptable to all. to establish a “digital bangladesh” is our government's motto.

advance income tax
the existing finance act has a provision to realise advance income tax at source at the rate of tk 1,000 at the time of issuance & renewal of trade license. this is a financial burden, particularly for small & medium enterprises (smes) & is directly counterproductive to the spirit of the current reform initiative to lower the cost of doing business. the smes hold the secret of growth for all sectors & should be provided with all support for their growth. they are the biggest employer of industrial workers in the country. there is no denying that focussed policy actions are needed for development of smes through fiscal measures. we appeal to the finance minister that the existing provision to realise advance income tax at source at the rate of tk 1,000 at the time of issuance & renewal of trade license be withdrawn from the budget.
government- ngo collaboration
there has been considerable debate on the role of ngos not only in bangladesh but also all over the world. nowadays ngos are regarded as the third executive arm of the government. bureaucrats are called the first executive arm as they are recruited to implement the policies and decisions taken by the government. they are an inseparable part of the government. again ngos are working according to their own plans and programmes. ngos are playing their role differently. sometimes they work as partner and sometimes as an implementing agency. special advantages of ngos are that they have access to the grassroots. ngos are realising the fact that in order to scale up their activities at national level there is no alternative but to get involved with the government. some contributions of ngos create an opportunity for the government- ngo collaboration. because balanced development is a complex undertaking that cannot be achieved by a single sector.
test status threatened?
i am a cricket fan. lately, however i notice that i only get involved in matches that bangladesh play in. in the olden days some of us supported pakistan while others went for india. now with our own team taking part, it is bangladesh all the way. imagine my shock when i read utpal shubhro's interview with david morgan, the president of icc, in prothom alo (13-6-2009). apparently, morgan feels bangladesh is not good enough to play test cricket and should be confined to odis and t20s only he feels that ireland is better than bangladesh. view the page international
