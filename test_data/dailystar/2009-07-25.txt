kali o kolom srabon 1416 - july 2009
the current volume of kali o kolom pays a timely tribute to the great 1930s marxist poet and art critic bishnu dey, who was a close friend of jamini roy. in fact, unless i am entirely off the mark, in a couple of the collection of marvelous photographs - one in which the poet is seen with louise macniece - accompanying the eleven articles on him can be spotted some of jamini's works. among the pieces on dey, i found interesting mahmud al zaman's 'kobi bishnu dey o bangladesher muktijuddho' , though to an extent the title promises a fraction more than it actually delivers (since it does not deal directly with the poet's life or activities in relation to the actual nine months of war and struggle). it is also interesting to contrast it with with the valuable reprint of a collection of 19 of the poet's letters to rajshahi university professor abu bakr siddiqui ranging from 1966 to 1986. in letter number 11 dated 29/1/1972, two months after independence, bishnu dey writes that “the first round of bloodshed has come to an end. now is the time for yet another struggle, a struggle for peace and which we all are hopeful about, and where the test will be even more severe, won't it?” it makes one wonder exactly what dey thought of the 1971 war - perhaps that it was a national liberation movement of the petit-bourgeoisie which should lead to a greater 'people's movement' - something that has always seemed to me to be the 'revolutionary' claptrap held sacred by middle-class maoist study circles. bishnu dey's poetry however heralded something genuinely new in bengali poetry, as did his incisive art criticism, the latter detailed by hasnat abdul hye in his 'chitrashomalok bishnu dey' . as some of the writers succeed in underlining sporadically in the other pieces, which at times seems to be a competition of who can write the more obtuse literary criticism, bishnu dey effortlessly rose above what dinesh chandra sen once termed as 'pucchanagrahita' : the blind adherence to trails laid down by predecessors.
on cricket books, dadas and st xavier's…
after a hiatus of nearly three years i've started reading cricket books again. it was sujit mukerhjee who started me off with his autobiography of an unknown cricketer, which i picked up for a song at a nilkhet bookshop. i enjoyed it so much that an urge to again read cricket books descended on me like monsoon rains on dhaka stadium. the last one i'd read was pundits from pakistan by rahul bhattacharya, on india's historic 2004 tour of pakistan. poor rahul, who came to dhaka on a promotional tour, where inane questions by bangladeshi sports journos at the book launch reduced him to mumbling clichés on sub-continental cricket. somehow, it put me off cricket books. view the page star health

some, not all, love can be divided
this is a scintillating autobiography from the highly accomplished writer maya angelou, who wears variegated caps as a musician, poet, performer and, on top of everything, a great mother albeit remaining fixated on her only child -- her teenage son, guy. although there is an assortment of real-life incidents in this book, yet as one reads it, one gets the feeling of devouring one of the best quality novels primarily because of the way the author presents an array of facts and also her style of language being so lucid. exactly for this reason, chicago tribune book world has stated that her 'personal narrative' in this book has attained a 'lyrical' quality and so enhancing its literary value. the author's acute perception of characters, who are a multitude, their conversations and interactions, all take place in settings revealing the complex nature of human beings. a kaleidoscopic journey into people, incidents and their loci unveils the truth that humans do have an innate dislike for things and people dissimilar to their own. she does the perfect job of an anthropologist in terms of her incisive observation and, making a record of each and every word and expression along with the body language associated therein, does the job of a perfectly trained psychologist in terms of explaining them in common parlance. for example, we hear the receptionist at the ghana broadcasting office who by some miraculous way recognizes angelou as someone 'different' and starts grilling her on the purpose of her visit. at one stage, she comments, "american negroes are always crude."

east of eden is described as steinbeck's most ambitious novel. it is the story of two american families as they settle down in the salinas valley, north california. this is the story of the trasks and the hamiltons and their interwoven life. the story holds a rich assortment of diverse characters. as one reads the story the characters seem to open up with new faces in every conceding chapter. the reader is bound to be amazed at how different people can be; how docile or cruel, how easy going or a hard a nut, how loving and yet wise. throughout the story the relationships among the amazing characters are perfectly articulated.
