bangladesh remembers today a great hero, a giant among men, who was born on this red-letter day in 1873. the whole nation honours and respects and admires this brave son of bengal because he loved peace and did everything in his power to avert dire calamities; because he merited the high and exalted positions to which the suffrage of a grateful nation elevated him; because he was regardless of personal gains and cheerfully endured all toil and hardship so that he might elevate the masses of mankind; because he had a high sense of honour, respected the rights of conscience, and nobly advocated equality of privileges and the universal brotherhood of man; because he had an unshakable faith in islam but never spoke ill of any other religion; because he was a man of the people. and bangladeshis believe that he was one of us and that he was for us. yes, sher-e-bangla a.k. fazlul huq, whose birth anniversary we celebrate today, really gave enormously of himself to the people, and he really loved the people.
development conference at harvard
bangladesh development initiative (bdi) held its second annual conference at harvard university's kennedy school of government on october 9 and 10. bdi's president, professor saad andaleeb raised two challenging questions in his message to the conference participants: how can the world's seventh largest populous nation "count itself as a more positive and productive force for its own development?" how can this nation stir itself up, boost its potential and "rebrand itself as a far more progressive nation?"

when the ageing but still incomparable groucho marx, now trundling into his eighties, was asked what he most wanted as a birthday gift, his reply was succinct: "last year." which year from their past would the bjp and shiv sena like as a gift? 2001. since then it has been a steady trot downhill.
