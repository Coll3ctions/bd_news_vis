asif zardari's pakistan
asif ali zardari has made it clear, or so he thinks, that there is nothing in the constitution of pakistan that can remove him from the presidency of the country. he is, so he suggests, in firm command of his physical as well as mental faculties and therefore there is absolutely no ground for him to be pushed aside from his position as head of state. his political opponents, among whom is the country's powerful army, believe otherwise. under article 47 of the constitution, they point out there is a good case for zardari's removal from the presidency. without anyone having to spell it out, president zardari's complicity in what has come to be known as "memogate" is a strong reason why his judgement as head of state has come into question.
