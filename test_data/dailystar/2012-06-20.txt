the abrasive ms. bannerjee . . .
mamata banner-jee revels in being abrasive, or so it seems. there is something about her brand of politics which does not allow her to exercise the sort of grace you would find, naturally, in someone like aung san suu kyi. in oslo last week, the burmese democracy icon reminded us once more of why she remains a much respected figure on the global stage in these times. the years of internment, the denial of power after the 1990 elections, the psychological torment inflicted on her by a regime clearly out of joint with the times have never been able to nibble away at the fundamental dignity in suu kyi. through her travails, suu kyi has grown, from the perspective of both morality and politics. like nelson mandela, she is today the voice of conscience for oppressed people everywhere. she does not enjoy power and yet power is what she exudes through the simple graces she bestows on those she comes in touch with.
