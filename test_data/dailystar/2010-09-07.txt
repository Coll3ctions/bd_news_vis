have you ever noticed how beautifully your body mechanism is regulated and your daily life is scheduled? well, everyone may not agree saying that they don't follow a specific routine for their daily life. imagine, yesterday you woke up at 5 or 6 am. if you do this consistently, no alarm is required to wake you at that practiced time. there is an alarm, virtually though, inside your body. in fact, there exists a biological clock, or more accurately clocks, in every living being, controlled and integrated by the brain where the master clock resides. the master clock, which is composed of scn (suprachiasmatic nuclei) cells, a group of nerve cells located in the hypothalamus region of the brain, makes a symphony, so that they are in synchronization, with the other clocks throughout the body and organs like in the esophagus, lungs, liver, pancreas, spleen, thymus, and the skin and thus creates and maintains perfect harmony.
balaur bondoc: dragon dinosaur
one of the questions that truly baffled paleontologists for generations is the ancient question: “what did the late cretaceous predatory dinosaurs in europe look like”? and finally it seems, the recent discovery of the first reasonably complete skeleton of a meat-feasting dinosaur from the final 60 million years of the age of dinosaurs in europe, is likely to shed answers to that long-standing question. unearthed from a former floodplain near the city of sebes, in central rumania, the fossil in question is that of a stocky, two-clawed relative of velociraptor, which paleontologists believe had twice as many giant stickle-like claws on its feet and happened to be more of a kick boxer than its notorious sprinter-like cousin. the partial skeleton of the predator (including leg, hip, vertebrae, arms, rib and tail bones), now called balaur bondoc (rumanian for stocky dragon) was unearthed by geologist matyas vermir, a geologist at the transylvanian museum society. it must be mentioned here that balaur is a genus of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur. according to dr. mark norell, chair of the division of paleontology, american museum of natural history, “we've all been waiting for something like this, and the wait has yielded an interesting surprise”. it is believed that ancient predator was about 6/7 feet tall (1.8 to 2.1 meters high) and roamed between 72 million and 65 million years ago. and this was during the end of the cretaceous period when much of the present-day europe was covered in higher seas and when romania was part of an island, archipelago. based on the study of the fossils (details of which have been published in the august 30th edition of proceeding of the national academy of sciences), the scientists believe that the creature had functional big toes with large claws. but the most interesting thing about this discovery is that this new species of carnivore had more than 20 features which strikingly make it unique since they are not shared by its nearest relatives. according to dr. norell, “it is one of the most unusual and strangest dinosaurs i've had the privilege of working on in my entire career”.
