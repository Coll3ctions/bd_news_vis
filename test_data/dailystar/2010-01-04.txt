our priorities after copenhagen
the daily star round table on post-copenhagen priorities on saturday has clearly brought home to us certain realities we in bangladesh need to handle where climate change is concerned. in precise terms, now that the accord, however flawed, is there, it is time to move from generalisations to specifics. this is especially true of bangladesh, one of the countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. indeed, with projections of as much as one-fifth of the country being lost to the ravages wrought by carbon emissions, there is certainly no time to lose. the options are limited or are not there at all. in other words, adaptability is not an option but a necessity for us as also for other vulnerable nations.
nahid redeems his pledge
set against failed track records of the national curriculum and text book board(nctb), or for that matter of the education ministry in reaching text books to schools ahead of academic session, what the education minister has pulled off is a truly remarkable feat. whereas school-going children could hardly lay their hands on school text books even well into the first quarter of an academic session, they are left profusely elated at the scent of the new books on their very first day in school.
growing old without maturing
we, the people who matter, hardly grew in bangladesh although the country has grown pretty old, whizzing past thirty-eight years eventful years of its existence. in the early seventies, the constant refrain used to be that of war ravages that did not let the honey and milk flow together in "golden bengal." we have lived much longer in independent bangladesh than we did in united pakistan, which we hold responsible for all of our woes. we now enjoy all the freedom to fashion our destiny and turn the country of our dream into a greener pasture. yet, nothing seems to have changed much beyond geographical bifurcation.

on a hotter planet!
mark lynas is an activist, journalist & author. he made many appearances in the media as commentator on environmental issues. he is author of high tide & was also selected as a national geographic emerging explorer in 2006. mark lynas tried to let the people know the information he could collect which is truly unique, a degree by degree guide to our future on a hotter planet. after reading this book it made me curious & terrified too. sunday times commented: “our future on a hotter planet-six degrees, i tell you now, is terrifying”. lynas says six degrees change in day night temperature will do no harm to the earth. but six degrees of global average change is an entirely different prospect. six degrees as he said was beginning to feel like a survival manual, full of indications about which parts of the globe might need to be abandoned & which would be most likely to remain habitable. it also came to light that global warming is making the hydrological cycle more intense causing heavier storm & more intense hurricanes to brew up out at sea. he said about the misery suffered in new orleans three years ago. he felt-like an insight into what the twenty first century may have in store for many of us in thousands of locations across the world as climate change accelerates. it further said that thermal inertia of the oceans would take centuries for temperature to stabilize which amply indicated that we have already reached the point of no return. he also said six degrees might be depressing, the impacts are terrifying but they are still avoidable.
for a modern dhaka
in view of the pledge of the prime minister to upgrade dhaka to a modern, beautiful and hassle-free city, ensuring smooth communications both on roads and waterways in and around the capital, i would like to reproduce below a few suggestions i made earlier on the issue of tackling the unplanned growth of the dhaka city:
price spiral
recently, the trading corporation of bangladesh(tcb) has released the information about price rates during the tenures of past three governments. in 2006, coarse rice was sold at tk 17 per kg, which became tk 27 on 5 january.
women's rights
a recent poll conducted by the daily star has illustrated that women’s rights are still a contentious issue in our country. the results of the poll reminded me of the criticism that the last caretaker government had to contend with after it passed the national women’s development policy. i realize i may be treading on very thin ice by bringing up this topic because of its obvious implications but, nonetheless, i would like to say that equality isn’t something that people have to strive for in this age. it should be something accorded to all of us regardless of our sex, income level, or religion.
"little things please little minds"
yes, one of your writers from uk has rightly and timely quoted the above proverb (ds 28 dec.) to 'stop name game'. i have had in mind to write at length on the subject but then thought the way the courtiers of the present government are active in collecting and suggesting names, i can not win the race!
bnp’s policy
the bnp’s stand against india’s proposal of sending security personnel to guard their high commission is quite intriguing. it’s also self-contradictory, because they never question the presence of us marine corps at the us embassy. if they allow the marines why create a fuss about the indians?
jamaat and a poet
my understanding is, a true muktijoddha can never compromise with the rajakars & al badr members who were involved with the gruesome killings and rapes of 1971. came to know from a local daily that poet al mahmud received an award from a reception of jamaat-e-islami that was arranged to honour (!) the freedom fighters. i personally feel disgusted that mr. al mahmud had the discernment to participate in a programme like this which was arranged by a political party which does not believe in the very existence of bangladesh!
future leaders
pakistani president mr. asif ali zardari has vowed to fight legal battle in the court against a recent supreme court ruling. we highly appreciate his spirit and believe that it will be a good end for public view.
underpass at mohakhali
thousands of people cross the airport road everyday from dohs mohakhali to banani & mohakhali bazar & vice versa risking their lives. but the city corporation is not paying any heed to the problem. may be they are not even aware of this problem. there are underpasses in karwan bazar & gulistan which are serving a useful purpose.
drug menace
drug addiction is a state of periodic or chronic intoxication produced by the repeated consumption of a drug (natural or synthetic). it is dangerous for health and a curse for society. there are thousands of addicted people in bangladesh and most of them are young. the young bangladeshis are addicted to drug because of agony, anxiety, depression, bad company etc. moreover, young people belonging to the upper class of society take alcohol and other drugs to maintain their status in the friend circles. day by day, they are becoming more addicted to drugs in order to keep on their friend circle. as a result, whenever the young are being addicted by drug, they can not come back from it, so that they have to face different kinds of problems in life. verily, drug is so easy to get in our country because its network is widespread.
toward and towards
one of my colleagues while engaged in writing a text suddenly asked me, what’s the difference between the words ‘toward’ and ‘towards’? in usage these two words often create confusions, which one is correct?
pensioners & red-tapism
the government should open one-stop service centres for old pensioners, so that they do not have to run from one office and table to another. this is essential in view of the new pension scales announced by the government.
cadet college story
thank you for the article on faujdarhat cadet college “wistful memories and unfulfilled promises” by m. rahman (the daily star: internet edition, december 15, 2009). it starts with his dilemma in joining the golden jubilee and ends with his disillusionment, in his view, in the elite school’s apparent failure of fulfilling the expectations of the nation. this is in stark contrast with a piece by another fcc alumnus f. ahmed, presumably his 6th intake mate, entitled “faujdarhat cadet college: half a century of excellence” (the daily star: internet edition, april 28, 2008) that glorified its ‘visionary founder’ and ‘the legendary founding principal’ as well as the accomplishments of many ex-cadets, among other things.
afghanpur, not pakhtunkhwa
let us strike at the root of the trouble. and the only best way out for resolving our protracted problems is to declare the presently 22 divisions of the country (pakistan) as provinces and each one has to be declared entitled for equal resources, irrespective of population, topography and area. the root cause for all of our basic tribulations is mis-governance and mismanagement because of incompetence of our elite and unmanageability of our masses. but looters are not supposed to be leaders.
our duty
the faithful have faith in the day of judgement. what we need is to keep on doing good to all.
energy spent, but no power!
from january to december this year, much energy has been spent in talking about new power plants. we have heard of many plans for doubling our power generation capacities within the next three years; but alas not even one contract for a new power plant has been signed till date. energy of sound-bites and print-bites have reached significant levels, but setting up of new power plants is at zero level of achievement!
mugda hospital
we need thousands of physicians to provide medical service to the countrymen and to send professional manpower abroad to earn foreign currency the country needs to implement the development programmes. a 500-bed hospital is being constructed at mugda in dhaka city by the government. no doubt it will increase health service facilities of the city. shortage of medical collages in the country is one of the reasons behind scarcity of qualified medical practitioners. thousands of science students at higher secondary level are interested to get medical education. indeed, expansion of general higher education increases unemployed educated population, which is at present a mere wastage of national wealth.
english grammar
i refer to the letter by o h kabir above ( 27dec09). firstly vowels are required to make a syllable which can be pronounced and it has nothing to do with grammar or meaning of a word. besides the five explicit vowels of a, e, i, o, and u: y is recognised as a half vowel for the purposes of creating a syllable for pronunciation. hence we can pronounce words like fly, dry etc of one syllable and slyly which is of two syllables or syzygy, a word of three syllables etc,. however use of y to enable creation of a syllable or syllables is much more restricted than the standard vowels, and syllabic words of this form are well known and are limited in number.
