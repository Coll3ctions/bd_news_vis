dark forces of the universe
dark energy is a cosmic phenomenon that mysteriously powers the accelerating expansion of the universe. discovered as early as early as 1998, this strange force, though invisible, makes up a staggering 72 per cent of our known universe! of the rest, 24 per cent is made up of “dark matter”, which is also invisible but can be detected by its gravitational pull. and as for the rest of the universe, a measly 4 per cent is actually made up of “the stuff that makes up people, planets, stars and everything that are made up of atoms”. scientists strongly believe that the pressure exerted by this dark energy is exactly what that pushes the universe to expand at an ever-increasing rate. and a recent finding by an international team of astronomers, with the aid of nasa's hubble space telescope (hst) and european space agencies very large telescope, concludes that, it is very likely that our universe will expand forever. led by prof. eric jullo of nasa's jet propulsion laboratory in california, the study findings, the details of which have been published in the august 20 issue of the journal science, also conclude that not only the universe will not stop growing but also eventually it would become a dead and cold wasteland with a temperature that is scientifically referred as “absolute zero”.

bat bombs
these nocturnal flying mammals became part of a bizarre animal experiment during world war ii. a dental surgeon upset by the japanese attack on the u.s. navy base at pearl harbor proposed attaching tiny incendiary bombs to bats. the creatures were meant to set thousands of small blazes across japan's cities as they flew to roost beneath building roofs. but the idea floundered after receiving the green light from president roosevelt. many uncooperative bats simply dropped like rocks or flew away, despite the u.s. army using as many as 6,000 of the mammals in their experiments. the u.s. navy spent $2 million after taking over the effort, before finally giving up. still, the bat bombs did manage to set fire to a simulated japanese village, a u.s. army hangar and a general's car. nowadays, pentagon scientists study how bat flight mechanics could inspire future aircraft designs and spy robots.
