ryuhei kawada and his lonely crusade
it is indeed very hard to imagine how a ten-year old boy would react if he was told that he has been infected with hiv since his early childhood and his infection might take the form of aids, making his already complicated life more difficult to sustain. for a ten-year old boy, we presume there is not much difference between hiv and aids, and also between the thin line of separation that childhood understanding puts between life and death. for life, in reality, is yet to take a head start for him, that would eventually take him to the uncharted waters of the real world where many of our childhood dreams get easily shattered. view the page sports

eliminate corruption
bangladesh has, in recent years, been categorised as the most corrupt nation in the world by reports of various donor agencies. while we may disagree with the validity of the assessments and question the methods used for reaching such a conclusion, there is no denying that corruption is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. it is also beyond dispute that corruption is the main reason for which bangladesh has been unable to achieve its expected level of development. it is of prime importance that the issue of corruption is addressed with an iron hand in order to attain a faster rate of economic development.
gender based discrimination
many analysts, researchers, development professionals have stated that levels of economic development, growth are lower in the countries where gender based discrimination, inequalities, violence occur frequently. such perceptions are inaccurate. women are also assaulted in developed countries and south asian states such as india, pakistan are more stable and prosperous than bangladesh.
garments sector
nothing can be more alarming than this poor state of the garments sector. we lost our historically vibrant jute sector due to the immature political decision of nationalisation and mismanagement and now again we are heading for the similar consequence due to the misdeeds of the visionless politicians, who hardly cared for national interest. the relentless and vigorous hard work of the entrepreneurs took the garments sector to the pinnacle of achievement in the presence of stiff competitors like our immediate neighbour and others in south-east asia. “survival for the fittest” being the order of the day, we have started lagging behind due to self-created conditions and unstable state of our national affairs.

students in china
students in china once played an important role. it has gone down in history as the may 4 movement.
professional bankruptcy?
sadia hassan's essay on the subject (aug;20) provokes interesting thoughts. quoting the writer "our bureaucracy siphons off millions of taka through mismanagement(?) and corruption of "locally raised fund" popularly known as lr funds. these funds have been kept outside the purview of audit to breed corruption". these few lines underline rich layers of gold: through proper bureaucratic channels!
du violence
i am saddened to find our students in pain and anger. i cannot respect or accept any external forces interfering in any academic environment. i have spent 33 years at different universities in europe, the us and japan, and i have never found students being exploited by the politicians, to destroy public properties or to express their anger and dissatisfaction.
submarine cable
it's quite unfortunate that despite repeated breakdown of submarine link, the bttb is paying less attention to creating a backup connectivity. after the much awaited launching of the submarine link, most of the isps have withdrawn the satellite link. as a result, when the submarine cables goes down, most of the users in bangladesh are deprived of using the internet. it not only affects the home users but also affects the businesses as all the business houses rely fully on the internet to carry on their day to day activities.
where are those people?
our ctg is cleaning the atmosphere by punishing and eliminating a few corrupt men.
biman
a "citizen's comment was printed in the letters column of a local english daily on 19 august. his proposal for the biman board of directors was better than the all secretary based board prepared by gob (possibly engineered by the secretaries' informal back scratching forum serving their interests). otherwise, with a professional board, every decision will be stuck up in a secretary's desk till the incumbent and his extended family get free return tickets by biman. considering this to be the standard operating practice; do the people have a choice?
in response....
i found "adivasis in trouble" in the letters to the editor page. in this letter it was mentioned that the forest department people are destroying the beauty of madhupur forest by eliminating banana and pineapple orchards. is it a true statement? do you think that these banana and pineapple orchards are the beauty of madhupur forests or are they black spots?
the sleeping tiger?
regarding the 'independence' of india and pakistan, i have to mention that 'undivided' india or bharat was always independent and had outstanding economic, academic and cultural excellence until the 'british traders' arrived. after the british finished 'trading and ruling', the foundation was laid not for two but three countries: india, pakistan and bangladesh. unfortunately, bangladesh became abandoned at birth although once bengal was one of the richest regions on earth. today the european colonialists once racing to grab the indian resources are united under 'eu'.
renaming the frigate
we are really shocked that the navy frigate named after bangabandhu sheikh mujib was renamed as khalid bin walid. the past bnp government, out of their jealousy and malice against bangabandhu, let the frigate remain as a lame duck for long five years. the bnp withdrew the word bangabandhu from the name of bangabandhu jamuna bridge and did also remove his picture from the currency. the bnp as we found, instead of showing bangabandhu the due respect, did relentlessly try to dwarf him or obliterate him from the history of hour liberation from pakistani occupation. they wanted to install their leader ziaur rahman in bangabanhu sheikh mujib's place.
america and oil
we are confused and are not sanguine about the aims, objectives and activities of world bank and imf.
ctg's job
the ctg's problems seem to mount every day as the latest issue of concern for the incumbent government was the countrywide student protests. these students, including the professors and lecturers of respective universities, were demanding withdrawal of the state of emergency. in addition, the present caretaker government also has to bear the brunt of floods because as the floods die down, the already high-prices of daily essentials will further skyrocket due to the adverse supply situation which is likely to continue. hence the public's agitation will further rise as prices of essentials will continue to show an upward trend and eventually criticism of the ctg will also rise. the rehabilitation of these homeless flood-affected people needs proper attention as the govt. has to rebuild their destroyed homes. to make matters worse, uncertainty looms over the future of the elections as ban on indoor politics has not been lifted yet. the closure of jute mills is another negative point of the ctg as the workers of these mills are yet to receive their arrear wages and their future look bleak. eventually, conditions such as these can provoke social unrest. also the state of emergency has caused decline in business and fdis might reduce as political uncertainty can result in mncs refusing to invest in bangladesh. so, gradually people's faith in the ctg seems to be fading.
ctg and politicians
i could not convince myself about the government's measures that it adopted after it had taken over power in january. all they have done so far is criticising the politicians in the name of eliminating corruption, although they overlooked the fact that bangladesh politics has been dominated by the army which ruled the country for decades. the government's journey started with arresting the most corrupt, however, the intensity of their drive slowed down later. view the page international
