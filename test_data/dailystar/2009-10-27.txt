in recent times few countries have deployed their national army against their own civilians. since being founded in 1947, pakistan has done it three times. less than forty years ago, in 1971, pakistan sent in the army to deal with an uprising in its own territory, in east pakistan. the strategy met with dire consequences, leading to civil war, the break-up of the country and hundreds of thousands of civilian casualties. barely four years later, pakistan's leaders turned to the army again, this time to control an insurgency in the tribal province of baluchistan. the struggle lasted five years, failed to deliver a politically sustainable solution and left thousands dead.

terrorism can be defined in different ways. it could be "the surprise threat or use of seemingly random violence against innocents for political ends by a non-state actor." international terrorism, on the other hand, implies acts of terrorism that include international consequences where terrorists go abroad to strike their targets.
