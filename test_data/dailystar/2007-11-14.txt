inadequate precautionary measures
view the page editorial
issue of 1971 war crimes
a few rightwing academics have just told us that in 1971 it was a war between india and pakistan, that bangladesh was not part of that war and hence there are no war criminals in bangladesh. it is time to speak plainly, clearly and bluntly about such men who have of late tried to denigrate the war of liberation. we believe the time has come to deal decisively with people whose assessment of the war is deliberately denigrating. already a leading figure of the jamaat-e-islami, a minister in the bnp-led government of begum khaleda zia, has ruffled the patriotic sentiments of bangladesh's people by suggesting that there was no genocide in 1971 and that there were no war criminals here. matters were then carried to ludicrous heights by a retired civil servant, an unabashed jamaat follower, when he stated that in 1971 it was a civil war and not a war of liberation which took place in bangladesh.

gen. musharraf's blunders
i was shocked to see the oppressed humanity and trampling of the highest chamber of judicial hierarchy in pakistan by president gen. pervez musharraf. although i was born decades after the bloody struggle of independence, but my parents told me that the crackdown scene on the streets of pakistan, telecast by satellite channels, showed profound resemblance to the crackdown on the protesters by the pak junta in the former east pakistan during early 1971. in fact, gen. pervez musharraf through his preemption on the supreme court has shown the same level of highhandedness demonstrated by his predecessors-- gen. yahya khan and gen. zia-ul haq. and, we do know what fate the autocrats have to face in the end, one is termed as the most despicable general and the other perishing out in a mysterious flight crash. i must not judge the whole pak army by a few power-greedy generals but it seems to me that the mindset of the generals has not changed much. alas! gen. musharraf has not learnt from history either.
dalai lama's observation
french philosopher gabriel marcel once distinguished between "problems" and "mysteries". a problem is something that confronts us from the outside and challenges us to master its complexity. eventually every problem, such as a broken computer, can be solved with unemotional detachment, objective analysis, sufficient time, and good technology because all such problems are commensurate with the human mind that posed them. mysteries, on the other hand, are questions of human existence that are so complex and deep that they can never be answered fully and satisfactorily by any one amongst us. contrary to the dalai lama, evil and suffering fall into this latter category.
price hike
the prices of essentials are going up every day. and the level of prices of the essential commodities is so high that it has already crossed the limits of tolerance. as a result, most of the people of bangladesh, who are really poor, landless, helpless and even the service holders, both govt. and non-govt., whose salary is not increasing in keeping with the prices of commodities, are now passing their days amid hardship. but the govt. has no time to address the acute problem, as it is busy removing corruption to present a free, fair and impartial parliamentary election to the nation. but what will be the condition of the people ? how will they survive? there are so many areas in this country where people cannot manage two square meals a day.
fertiliser crisis
most people in bangladesh are employed or engaged in the agricultural sector. but every year we see a fertiliser crisis. the government claims that a sufficient quantity of fertilisers is there, but the field level scene is different. farmers block government offices and assault government officers for fertilisers.
a military-backed government
the above phrase was probably first used by the economist to describe the present system of government in bangladesh.
“no” to golf course!
it was reported in the electronic news media on november 5 (prothom alo) that 25 out of 64 acres of the suhrawardy uddyan would be allocated to dhaka club to build a golf course. i am outraged by this decision.
burden of proof
the nation is already struggling hard to find its political destiny. now the very foundation of our state and nation has been shaken by reckless and unpatriotic comments of some jamaat leaders and their sympathisers and patrons. the government response to this is not fully positive. this might encourage the jamaat leaders and their patrons to continue to defy the truths. we think that all shades of opinion, except the jamaat and its patrons, will agree in one voice that it is the prime obligation and responsibility of the government to initiate the legal process of identifying the war criminals or " rastrodrohi", whatever we call them, and to bring them to justice for their heinous crimes like murder, rape, arson looting etc, committed during the war of liberation in 1971. we fail to understand how the jamaat can deny and defy their own acts already well documented in our history and in our memory. this act of denial itself is a crime.
diplomatic service rules
according to existing diplomatic service rules of bangladesh, a diplomat can never tie the knot with a foreign national, and even cannot give an oral or written promise to marry a foreigner. as the law should treat everyone equally, so it's expected that dr. debapriya's case would not be an exception.
army's good work
it was very good work undertaken by the army personnel for the flood victims during the recent devastating floods caused by the unprecedented rainfall and also by water entering bangladesh from neighbouring india.
magistracy
the judiciary in bangladesh has started a new era and a journey to establish justice which was so long considered almost a far cry. november 1, 2007 shall remain as a milestone in the history of establishing the rule of law.
resistance is futile
from the newspapers we learned that a singer, named nasir gazi, was murdered by the muggers when he resisted them and it is alleged that the killers fled away with tk 60,000 which they took from him. we are shocked.
fertiliser shortage
it is not only unfortunate but disgusting that every year we are facing a fertiliser crisis in bangladesh. it seems that all the experts in this sector are only trying to solve the problem by importing various types of fertilisers. it may be noted that when someone uses chemical fertilisers on a regular basis, then the requirement of the same increases each time it is applied in the land. the organic matter of the soil is also affected.
political history
the 'golden bengal' was the richest region in india. the 'british traders' successfully implanted the seeds of partition among us. the only way the highly cultured and treasured india could be divided was through religion, nothing else. why do the muslims need a separate country as masterminded by the british and engineered by jinnah? was jinnah a true muslim himself? in fact, the current muslim population of india is bigger than pakistan's. the only reason india is emerging as a superpower is because of its diverse and united workforce. can west bengal alone be a major global power? definitely not.
raid on club
i was watching the ntv morning news of nov.2, 2007. a video news was aired concerning the raid on a club in gulshan area by the police to take legal action against those involved in drinking, dancing etc. there is no doubt that this was a lawful act on the part of the police. but one thing strikes my mind: was it necessary to take a television camera to take pictures and expose the suspected offenders to public view?
civil service
apropos mr. ziauddin choudhury's letter "professional conduct" published in ds on october 28. he wrote, "we cannot expect professional conduct from officials who have no tradition to follow, no training in what professionalism entails, and who have been reared in an environment of self promotion".
political leaders
the country witnessed how the entire nation suffered in the hands of corrupt politicians. stalwarts of both major parties are now behind bars, some even landed their with their children! presently, it is really shocking to learn about the illegal and anti-social activities of some politicians who have brought disgrace to the nation as a whole. view the page international
