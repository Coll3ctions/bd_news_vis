pm's distancing act
the decision taken by prime minister sheikh hasina to step down as the organisational chief of awami league's student wing bangladesh chhatra league (bcl), following the latter's notorious activities across the campuses, has been received with mixed reaction by people in general. we would like to believe that it is not merely an expression of disgust but one of determination to cry a halt to bcl tyranny that has been wreaking havoc as much on higher education as people's confidence in the credibility of the ruling party and the government.
mps on school and college committees
the reported move by the government to have local members of parliament play a major role in the management of non-government schools and colleges is rather disquieting. it is so because of the negative consequences such a move may have on these institutions where a proper and efficient administration is concerned. in this respect, it is the past record of non-government educational institutions under political management that we are reminded of. and we cannot but say that the record has never been a good one given the propensity of political figures on the management committees to give a partisan colour to the running of schools and colleges and thereby inject controversy into the entire process.
a losing battle from slippery slope
the month of march commemorating the first days of the struggle for liberation in a series of elitist formal gatherings in the capital gave the beleaguered awami league government a feel good commercial behind which it could conveniently take refuge from the ugly realities that have befallen the dispensation ever since it took charge. though commoners like us enjoyed no access to the elites' celebrations, we did commemorate by reminiscing about those glorious days. however, the reprieve was soon over.

fire safety measures
the ds-iba round-table on the matter, published by you on april 1 is quite welcome. it is good that public awareness about fire hazard is increasing after the recent bashundhara fire. about the recommendations of the round table, i would like to add a few ideas which can be introduced by the government to increase protection against fire disasters.
environmental degradation
the dhaka city environment with scarcity of safe drinking water, fresh air to breathe & the mosquito menace is almost a hell for many of its dwellers except a very few fortunate people. one has to just see the state of the rivers; buriganga & shitalakhya to realise the extent to which we all are so indifferent to allow such dangerous level of pollution. polluted air with unabated mosquito breeding everywhere are examples of total failure of the civic authorities.
footpath luxury
markets, bazaars, pharmacies at every street corner. but how do i get there? there's the option of taking a rickshaw, but that would cost money. what about taking the car? don't want to get stuck in the traffic jam. or there is another option...walking. yes. that's a good idea. doesn't cost money, can get some fresh air, and exercise.

obama and nato summit
with the end of the g-20 summit in london, president barack obama arrived in strasbourg for attending the two-day summit marking the 60th anniversary of the birth of nato. after his talks with french president nicolas sarkozy, obama said “this is not an american mission, this is a nato mission, this is an international mission.” these words reflect the fact that the us definitely is seeking more european help in dealing with its war against afghanistan. in other words, obama is basically trying to convince the european nations to pledge sending more troops into afghanistan. and if not military troops, obama expects that they will at least provide more non-military aid in terms of helping to train the afghan army and police; sending civilian experts to assist the afghan government and providing financial aid to run these schemes.
bcs written exams

poorly managed tourist spot
we went to visit shalbon bihar (maynamati, comilla) on friday, 27th march 2009. we hired two microbuses from mymensingh to make our journey. this was the first trip for all of us to shalbon bihar. naturally, we all were very excited to have a close look at this renowned historical place. we reached shalbon bihar at 12:30pm. we got down from the bus hurriedly to buy tickets for the entrance. when we reached the ticket counter we found it closed, nobody was around. upon checking with the guards at the main entrance, we were surprised to know that the tickets won't be available till 2:30pm. and we also noticed a signboard on the right side of the gate where it was written that the gate would remain closed from 12:30pm to 2:30pm on friday. i would like to ask the authorities-- how have you introduced such a timing on the weekly holiday? to add to this, when we tried to visit the museum in the afternoon at 4:45pm, we found it closed too, as the man in charge was not around.
police and magistracy
it has been reported in an english daily that police wants magistracy power in the metropolitan areas. the concept is against the principle of separation of judiciary from the executive. we think the provision will break the fundamental principles of justice that policing and magistracy should not be vested in one authority. bangladesh throughout its 38 years of journey has passed and practiced undemocratic norms of legal and policing functions. we can see the emergence of district police officer as equal to district magistrate, an issue which never came up for compromise in the past. the police department has already earned the privilege to be equal to the executives. now they are asking to share the judicial powers as magistrate. the question is how one looks at it. the dictators, and undemocratic governments will always look for support from the law enforcing agencies and would always agree to enhance their power and privileges violating the fundamental principles of justice. i do not know what provision exists on this issue in a democratic country like india. nevertheless, i think the principle should get precedence over individual needs. the issue needs to be reviewed at all levels of the government.
preparing for exams
studying without aid is one of the most effective approaches to prepare for exams. it enhances not only the personal study skills but increases the ability to handle some critical study-related issues. though it is quite difficult for some students, it can be fruitful if they stick to it.
reckless driving
may i make a modest suggestion to help in the slow and essential process of holding the owners and drivers of vehicles accountable for how they are driven? in the uk, the backs of many trucks, buses and other vehicles on the road display a telephone number and a notice 'driven well? if not, report to....' after all, bad driving not only threatens life and limbs but the profits of a business…
nuclear power plants
bangladesh has started negotiation with russia to set up two 1000mw nuclear power plants. this is most welcome news for all of us. nuclear power is the cheapest, cleanest as well as one of the most sustainable power sources. but there are two important tags attached to such projects. initial installation cost is huge and secondly, and perhaps most importantly, safety aspects are very important. for a poor but densely populated country both aspects need careful study. cost-wise may be russia will give a better offer but as far as safety is concerned perhaps we should consider the french power plant as an alternative. france has the most advanced nuclear power technology where almost 80% of their need is met by nuclear plants with an enviable safety track record. our policy planners may search other alternatives as well. but we must keep in mind that safety comes first, particularly when we deal in anything nuclear.
rising salinity and agriculture
as i travel to the southern parts of chittagong, i can see acres of waste land --tracts of land lying idle. there is little sign of green--the landscape looks almost grey. in the past, the farmers used to grow crops in those lands during this time of the year. unfortunately, the scene of lush green paddy field is now a part of the memory. in fact, one can see only caked earth covered with dead stubbles and weeds. view the page international
