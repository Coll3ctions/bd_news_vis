arsenic -- a silent killer
arsenic in ground water was detected in bangladesh more than a decade ago when the country had just achieved more than 95% coverage in supplying safe drinking water in the rural areas and making available irrigation water for the high yielding variety crops. more or less that was a win-win situation for drinking and irrigation water in the rural areas. but this achievement was outshined after the detection of arsenic in the ground water. basically arsenic is a natural water contaminant originated from naturally occurring sulfide ores. it has a geological origin. the main source are the arsenic containing rocks from the himalayas which were taken out by torrents of water and washed down by the rivers to the low lying areas of bangladesh and west bengal. these had been getting deposited together with sand, silt and clay for thousands of years forming a part of aquifers that have been releasing the poison today. arsenic is a hazardous material and recent studies showed that it is a carcinogen, reportedly responsible for lung and skin cancers. view the page literature

small talk

rumours over the fall of us
when i come to study what has been, at different times and epochs of history among different peoples, the effective reason why ruling classes have been ruined, i note the various events and men and accidental and superficial causes, but believe me, the real cause, the effective one, that makes men lose power is that they have become unworthy to exercise it.

the bumpy road to development
economics is not always a dismal science. but then, when has it ever been in that category? judging by the wide nature of rizwanul islam's reflections on the subject, indeed on the whole concept of development economics as it encompasses the globe as a whole, you would think there is yet much to know about the subject. and you do learn, for in this work the writer brings together a whole set of perspectives on economic theory, or theories as the case may be, that will appeal to readers. but, first, a charming little caveat. the work is in essence a series of observations that take an entire international community into consideration rather than focusing on a region or, more specifically, a country.
