gen. moeen's reiterations
the army chief general moeen u ahmed has dismissed, in unequivocal terms, all the speculations and rumours that he might become president as figment of the imagination. the statement, very much consistent with his apolitical position since the army-backed caretaker government took over in january this year, has reinforced his firm commitment to democratic values and assures us of his unflinching support to restoration of democracy in the country -- the number one issue on the national agenda. the army chief has only echoed the popular expectation that the existing political vacuum should be filled with a democratically elected government.
