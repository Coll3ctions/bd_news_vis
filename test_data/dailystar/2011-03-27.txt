pm's welcome call to opposition
we welcome prime minister sheikh hasina's call to the opposition to join the ruling party to register their contributions to the forthcoming session that will concern itself with amendments to prevent grabbing of state power through extra-constitutional means. her statement in the jatiyo sangsad on thursday to associate the opposition with the process should be reciprocated by the latter. we believe that in the larger interest of pluralism and with a view to securing a democratic future for the nation, the bnp should take up the government offer. that this nation has paid a high price because of past instances of coups and counter-coups has never been in doubt. the need, therefore, is now for both the ruling and opposition parties to forge a consensus on effectively putting a stop to such adventurism by ambitious elements.

need for independent directors
the importance of financing any business requires no elaboration. in addition to owners' equity, raising money from the capital market and borrowing from banks seem to be the commonly used avenues, especially for large business entities. the money raised from the market is public money and financing from banks is made out of depositors' money. if any business is run by the owners' capital only, involvement of public interest is at a minimum, unless it is a public utility entity. even in some countries, businesses absolutely funded by owners do not warrant an audit, except for verification by the revenue department for tax collection purposes.

weekly currency roundup
march 20-24, 2011
international markets:
this week attention turned to the euro zone with the sovereign debt issues again coming to the forefront. the euro rebounded from an early fall on thursday on middle east and sovereign buying, with worries over portugal's political crisis and the health of the spanish banking system increasingly factored in to the currency. still, traders say rallies are likely to be shallow and the euro will struggle to rise past option barriers around $1.4250, the level it hit on tuesday for the first time since early november. the euro was up about 0.3 percent on the day at $1.4125 after slipping to a low of $1.4049 in early european dealing following moody's announcement that it had downgraded 30 spanish banks by one or more notches, though notably not the biggest players, santander and bbva. adding to the euro's woes, portugal's prime minister quit on wednesday after parliament rejected his government's latest austerity measures, increasing the chances that the country will need a bailout. market participants said the currency was growing resilient in the face of a string of bad news, though this may not be a positive development. the dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against a basket of currencies, was steady at 75.826, clinging to the gains it made on wednesday. against the yen, the dollar held steady from late us trade at 81.00 yen. market players are wary that japan may intervene further to sell the yen if the dollar drops below 80 yen, and especially if such a move occurs in volatile trade as was the case last week, when the yen hit a post-war record high of 76.25 to the dollar in the wake of a devastating earthquake and tsunami and a nuclear crisis. view the page metropolitan

access to inani beach
on 1st. march a local daily published a full page photograph which depicted the pristine beach at inani, 15 kilometres from cox's bazar, which is overcrowded during holiday season. the advice to visit this beach, free from any crowd was indeed welcome news! however, walking up and down covering 30 kilometres to go and return along the beach from cox's bazar will be very tiresome for most, especially for those over 50. it would have been most useful and very informative, if there was information for readers giving the direction and access to the location from a motor able road, and the nearest place where reasonably good board and lodging could be available; so that tourists can enjoy the beauty of this delightful beach.
keep the city clean
now dhaka city is decorated with colourful lights and it has attracted many city dwellers. people are travelling to dhaka from different places only to see the beauty. but to add to the beauty we should also keep it clean. it is a common sight that people throw plastic bottles and rubbish on the road which can cause severe accidents any time. the government should place dustbins alongside the roads, in parks and every public place. this rubbish can be recycled. this is the proper time for the city people to show their responsibility towards the country. we have to start the process ourselves and show the path to others, rather than waiting for others to start, because it is our own country.
our team was over rated
it is not clear to me our team's problems while facing an accurate decent bowling line. it looked like they have not faced anything like this before and didn't know what to do other than give away the wickets. shakib gave an indication of loosing ahead of time (how great!) but the manner in which they lost broke people's heart.
what a contrasting game!
bangladesh cricket team's precarious defeat at the hands of the west indies team still haunts many. our faces dipped in shame at the performance of our team. we all saw in awe the performance of west indies and felt that they are just invincible. but the pakistan cricket team proved us wrong. in the first quarter-final match, pakistan not only bowled west indies out in 43.3 overs for only 112 runs but also defeated them by 10 wickets in just 20.5 overs and set a record in the history of the world cup cricket. pakistan still retains many veterans in the team. but we find veterans' absent in our team. our cricket authorities should consider this point with due importance.
ungrateful pakistan team
pakistan played their quarter-final match against west indies and came out with flying colours. bangladeshi cricket fans went to watch the match and most of them cheered for pakistan team all through the match .what hurt us most came at the end, when pakistani cricketers were being interviewed by ramiz raza, where none of them thanked bangladeshi crowd, instead they thanked people coming from pakistan. they should learn the basic manner of thanking the local crowd who were cheering for them. earlier, when wasim akram was the captain, he never forgot to thank the local crowd, and even when they lost to bangladesh in the 1999 world cup, he said in an interview that pakistan had lost to their brothers. shahid afridi and his team should learn some manners from the great cricketers.
indian rupee and bangladeshi taka
almost daily we come to know the exchange rates of bangladeshi taka with many foreign currencies through our tv, radio and national newspapers.
what a foreign ministry!
the awami league government is virtually failing in every aspect of governance. while all other countries are showing deep concern for their nationals, what is our foreign ministry doing? the relatives of the stranded bangladeshis were bound to form a human chain to force the government to act! foreign minister dipu moni while discussing with the reporters only referred to 'their' source of information, whereas the relatives of the stranded bangladeshis were referring to the direct telephone talks with their near and dear ones. if the foreign ministry cannot do anything for their nationals, at least they can give right information regarding what is happening to them!
ban this nonsense
one should travel in buses to understand the torture the passengers undergo when cassettes are played loudly. when music turns into cacophony, it is unbearable. a similar ban should be imposed on hi-fi music systems in all city buses. blaring music causes irritation not only to the passengers but also to other road users. the disturbance caused by noise pollution is more pronounced in places where hospitals and clinics are situated in the vicinity of marriage halls, student hostels. it is also time to ban loud talk by people on cell phones on balconies of residential complexes without any consideration for the neighbours. what about those who take out processions on the streets and chant slogans? that no one presented this aspect of noise pollution to the court is an opportunity lost.
farmers - the real heroes
bangladesh is a land of villages. most people of these villages are farmers. they are the real patriots who contribute a lot to our economy. without their tremendous labour it would be impossible for us to exist in this planet. but do the nation and the govt. do anything for their future? we should not forget these heroes, because they are the people who make the barren fields green and keep us alive.
stop bikes on footpaths
i would like to express my gratitude to rizwanuzzaman laskar for his reporting on reckless riding of motorcycles even on footpaths in dhaka on 28th february. it is also true that the reckless drivers do not even bother about the reports in newspapers. when someone runs a motor bike, he is seen considering himself the only important person. these bikers cause a lot of sufferings to the pedestrians. this insensitive practice is prevailing in all cities of bangladesh including chittagong. i myself once fell victim, when the biker defied the traffic signal, injured me and fled the scene. will the government do anything about this?
make abortion safe
experts say, in bangladesh one third of the pregnancies are either unwanted or unplanned. but attempt to get free from unwanted pregnancies carry potential threats for infection and long-term problems, if done in an unhygienic and unsafe way.
is media taking a turn?
there was a time when the media acted as a watchdog of democracy. today, true journalism has become a rarity. the media have a significant role in formulating public opinion. but they ignore people's issues such as poverty, corruption, and raging communalism. from the television news channels and other media, we come to know more about hollywood stars and their luxurious spending than about the decline in agriculture, migration of labour and growing poverty among the rural masses. if the fourth estate has lost its exalted position, it is because of a paradigm shift in the priorities of reporting, driven by corporate interests. both the print and the visual media are giving a go-by to journalistic ethics and all that matters is sensationalism.
cease smoking by laser!
a saudi anti-smoking charity organisation 'purity' has launched a campaign inspiring smokers to quit their habit within 30 minutes. how is this possible? yes, this is possible through application of cold laser beam. a laser device is used to generate a 'feel-good' like chemical called endorphins in smoker which is generally produced by nicotine in cigarettes. endorphins calm and relax the body to reduce nicotine craving towards cessation of smoking habit. the laser treatment is a little expensive but i am sure if introduced by charity/philanthropic organisations or hospitals (in lower rate), many smokers in bangladesh will be interested to avail of the facility to get rid of their smoking habit.
we are in need of wise men
winston churchill once called gandhi 'a naked fakir'; it did not diminish gandhi's greatness a bit. those people who are calling dr. yunus 'blood sucker' only have showed their own ignorance. in the 'puranas' there is a famous story. when a benevolent king died, god appeared before him to give him a boon. but god had one condition; if the king decides to go to the heaven he will be given 100 idiots to accompany him; on the other hand, if he chooses to go to the hell, he will be given 10 wise men to accompany him. the king thought for a moment and then replied, 'almighty, if i take 100 idiots with me to the heaven, the heaven will turn into a hell for me; but if i take 10 wise men with me to the hell, they will make the hell a heaven for me'. this simple story tells us why we are unable to make our country a 'sonar bangla'.
