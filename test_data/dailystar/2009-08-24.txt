madhupur and the loss of our forests
biological diversity looks about to be a thing of the past in bangladesh, if the state of the madhupur forests is any indication. a well-documented report in this newspaper yesterday threw up all the insidious details of the way the forests have been ravaged over the last forty years and in their place have come projects ostensibly geared to development. just how such so-called development programmes can wreak damage on nature has been made clear in the madhupur forests. in the last four decades, as much as 85 per cent of the forests have vanished. that means the overall area of the forests has come down from 45,000 acres to a mere 8,000 acres today. in spaces where woodland trees and plants essential for herbal medicines used to be, there are today banana and pineapple plantations. more ominously, human settlements have also been set up in the forests, thus posing even more serious threats to the environment.
bid to grab private property by force
it seems that the wicked would stop at nothing to get what they want. a recent incident of kidnapping and unlawful confinement of a family of nine in old dhaka amply illustrates the regrettable increase in the incidence of illegal grabbing of property, particularly of the vulnerable. in many such cases the predators use their political link to exert undue pressure on the victims. in this case, reportedly, force was used at the behest of a developer who had tried but failed to secure the property of the victims, and used force to lay their hands on the small piece of property, the only possession of the poor family.
transit: a sub-regional issue
it has been a bizarre experience to witness the furore over the question of transit during the recent months. the importance and urgency accorded to it have indeed a tinge of mystery. the question of transit was never a major item on our foreign policy agenda -- let alone a national issue -- although it could have existed in the peripheries of numerous policy discourses in the foreign office with regard to our bilateral relationship with india. from the hints dropped in recent years by several indians of prominence, it could be established that india is interested in transit through bangladesh.
the magic in market
with the advent of the holy month of ramadan, the kitchen markets in the capital have started to experience a magical rise in the prices of essentials. the government's move to hang a price chart at the kitchen markets in a bid to protect the consumers from the price cartels is not going to help in any way. view the page sports

save the poor farmers
to save the poor cultivators in severely flood affected areas and to make the next harvest better to sustain the gross domestic product (gdp) of the country, the crying needs are:
ship breaking
i would like to bring to your attention the fact that the government is discouraging primary steel production in your country. the ship breakers are restraining the steel producers from entering due to their influence in the ministries. because of this the people of bangladesh are suffering through paying a high price for steel. bangladesh has high reserves of iron ore and it should use it for producing steel.
religion of peace
i always feel the media is portraying islam wrongly. every muslim knows that killing an innocent person is compared to that of killing the whole humankind in islam. from islam we learn that a person cannot be a muslim whose neighbour passes the night in hunger. prophet muhammad (pbuh) once told a young men that taking care of his old parents would be the best jihad for him. politeness, self-control, charity, generosity, manners, truthfulness and what not are elements of islamic teaching.
good and bad students
the other day channel-i arranged a discussion with the students to get to the bottom of the causes of failure and the discussants were the hon'ble education minister, prof. muhammad zafar iqbal and mrs. khusi kabir. the students, among many other problems faced by them, referred to forcefully that they do not get proper attention of and support from their teachers in class teaching. the poor students blamed their fate as they could not afford money, they could not go to subject-wise coaching practised by the school/college teachers in their residences. the renowned personages above, though accepted the students' views, did shy away from finding fault with the teachers, and while advising the students stressed, among other things, the imperative of reading the text, first and last, instead of going through the guides for short-cut success. question remains whose duty is it to make the students get the habit of reading the text to know things fully and find out the answers there from?
dmch issue
i am writing in reference to dhaka medical college hospital's visitors' fee introduction (source: the daily star; 11-08-09). the authorities introduced the mechanism to reduce crowding of visitors which is definitely an issue of concern. journalists might have noted bad implication of the procedure on patients and criticizing its implementation without approval by the ministry of health & family welfare (mohfw), they have published the news.
political 'mosquitoes'
one of the small pleasures of life is to go through the daily newspaper with the first cup of morning tea. this pleasure is denied in bangladesh, thanks to the exuberance of our super-agile politicians. daily, the pages are crammed with the bangladeshi human beings?
a new beginning
a dream came true when bangladesh were able to chase 312 runs against zimbabwe. a victory against 312 was really tough. august 16 was the historic day for bangladesh cricket.
book review
a grand page of book review that appeared on the national mourning day.
real tigers!
the symbol of bangladesh national cricket team is tiger, yet their performance was not tiger-like in the past. especially in test matches, their performance was very poor. for this reason our cricketers and all bangladeshi people were desperate for a test win.
our export basket
our traditional export market of jute, jute-goods, tea, raw and tan-hide had long been lost due to national policy missteps and international trade imbalance. in the early eighties of last century some innovative and talented entrepreneurs of our country emerged on the scene with a new commodity for sale in the global market with a huge promise and that is today's rmg. although faced with tremendous handicaps like absence of backward and forward linkage, poor infrastructure, perennial power-shortage, inefficient port facility and paucity of skilled professionals etc. the rmg industries on their own achieved a fantastic growth over the years. today it is not only the biggest employer in the country but also it accounts for nearly 80% of our total export earnings, second only in volume to the earnings from our overseas workers.

killing , mugging…
every day after getting up from bed when we have a look at the newspaper, killing, mugging, smuggling etc come to our eyes first. we get utterly surprised when we hear the news of the crimes taking place in broad daylight. now our country is burdened with some major problems like poverty, and militancy. again the country is in a precarious position over the issues like tipaimukh dam, maritime boundary with its neighbouring countries. in this situation if the country is to struggle with its internal affairs, then it would be like a suicidal act. during the rule of the caretaker government, we experienced a drastic reduction of crime as most of the godfathers, top terrors were in jail. but now it's a political government and we feel the comeback of the top terrors with their notorious activities. so it is clear that these are none but the party men of the al who are giving shelter to the criminals. view the page international
