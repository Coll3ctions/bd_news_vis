the outcome from davos
the world economic forum meet in davos ended on a note of warnings for the shape of things to come in 2008. the risk of a us recession and slowing global growth, as we see it, warrant 'a coordinated action' on the part of not only the economic power houses but also of developing countries. ldcs likely to be at the receiving end in terms of reduced prospect for export in the event of a recession in the west should have certain leveraging against fall in trade incomes through better terms of trade. so, the coordination of policies should not be entirely be confined to the world's elite but also be inclusive of developing countries' stand-points.
zia's potential yet to be realised
it is disconcerting news that while zia international airport (zia) has the potential to earn huge revenues for the country it remains underutilised at the moment because of lack of vision, planning and initiative. a report says that bangladesh could earn over taka 400 crore annually as extra revenue if the passenger handling capacity of zia could be put to full use by the civil aviation authority of bangladesh (caab). while we believe tk. 400 crore is a huge sum for a country like bangladesh, we fail to understand what is stopping the authorities concerned from going all out towards tripling of the present income.

sudan: a forgotten place?
has the world forgotten about the crisis in sudan? no one seems to care about this issue anymore. may be the rest of the world thinks that civil war, famine, poverty are just the fates that the people of the african continent have to embrace, whether they like it or not. the darfur region of western sudan has been the focus of international attention since 2004, when government troops and militia groups known as janjaweed moved to crush rebels who complained that the black residents of the region had been neglected by the central government. the situation has got worse but still the people of the western world clearly deny the happenings of sudan as acts of genocide. the same thing happened with rwanda. when almost half the population was wiped out, the world then seemed to understand that it was genocide. how many hundreds or thousands of people need to be killed in order to call it a genocide? the western world could have taken severe actions long time ago to stop the crisis in darfur, sudan. still they make statements that the happenings in darfur are not acts of genocide.
global warming
global warming is now a major concern for all of us, especially for those living in south asian countries. in this regard, bangladesh is the most vulnerable. as a deltaic country, bangladesh is very close to the sea. due to global warming, the glaciers are now melting away. and the melting will increase the sea level water. the bali conference has ended up without any fruitful decision. the rich countries are the major contributors to global warming. their indiscriminate use of fossil fuels and various types of acs and refrigerators cause different types of harmful gas emissions.

“hasina's illness”
i totally agree with mr. hoque (jan 13) that hasina should not be sent abroad for treatment at the cost of the public exchequer. there are hundreds of thousands of people in bangladesh with far worse illnesses than sheikh hasina's, some of whom are the only bread-earner of the family. therefore, if the caretaker administration wants to spend public money on treating patients, those poor people should be treated first, not sheikh hasina or khaleda zia. besides, why do they need to go abroad? some of the best family doctors and hospital specialists in the uk are actually from bangladesh, pakistan and india. so if sheikh hasina is looking for good doctors, luckily, she is in the right country. whichever way you look at it, there is absolutely no reason for spending precious public money like this. we have other urgent, life-threatening issues that are in desperate need of some government money.
advisers' role
in the present situation, we need to cooperate with chief adviser and all other advisers in his cabinet. we should not forget that the honourable advisers are here for the betterment of our country. remember, the advisers are not politicians. their responses to journalists should not jeopardize the roadmap for a democratic government or have a negative impact on the overall situation. advisers are here on a temporary basis and for the smooth transition of power to a democratic government.
disappointing!
i watched the programme which was telecast live on the ekushey tv on january 9, 2008 and became very disappointed with it.
bangladeshi artefacts
the latest information from paris is extremely alarming. the controversial guimet museum has reportedly decided to sell the whole lot of artefacts sent from bangladesh for exhibition. according to various sources, guimet authorities have already finalised at least three deals of selling extremely precious and the rarest bangladeshi artefacts to prospective buyers. initial value of these three items have already been fixed at us$ 93 million. guimet has also expelled the representatives from bangladesh museum and abandoned any possibility of sending the artefacts back to dhaka. it is also reported that a number of influential people are involved in such trafficking of national assets abroad, defying massive reactions and protests from bangladeshis. although the interim government repeatedly promised to the nation that the artefacts would return to dhaka soon, it is already understood that the promise will not be fulfilled.
don't forget the valiant
radio foorti was the media partner of the event 'concert for bangladesh'. i'm a regular listener of this radio station and came to know of this praiseworthy event as its jockeys circulated the news, saying the event location was 'kamalapur stadium'. the next day i came to know through a newspaper that the actual name of that stadium is “birsrestho shahid md. mustafa stadium”. jockeys of radio foorti could have uttered the full name of the stadium with a hint of the precise location 'kamalapur' and thus they could have expressed a little more respect and availed another opportunity to remind the listeners of the unparalleled sacrifices of our valiant martyrs for the cause of our beloved motherland.
more work, less talk!
people were really expecting the advisers to work very efficiently. but it seems that they have failed. the only reason for failure is unnecessary involvement and comments on some issues which could easily be neglected. every position and designation should have a boundary line which shouldn't be violated. we saw some members' departure which really worries us. new members have taken the oath to work for the country under the caretaker government, new hopes are on for the people. the nation wants to say once again --please work more talk less!
higher education
one of my relatives who was then a student of dhaka university once said that he had learnt nothing new after higher secondary. it indicates the condition or the standard of higher education in our country. i personally agreed with this statement. in my experience i found that the environment of most of the higher education centres is too bad for imparting proper education. for this reason, to increase the standard of education, higher education should be made attractive. if higher education is made attractive, our standard of education will rise automatically.

jamaat's background
i am not surprised to hear the recent statements of some perverted jamaat leaders, who committed "war crime" during our liberation war. but i am astonished to see that the comments came at a time when the army-backed interim govt is striving hard to consolidate national unity. jamaat leaders' false statements regarding our liberation war is nothing new, but the way they talked flabbergasted all.
suicide bombers
i was staring at a photograph printed in the daily star on 11-01-2008 showing pakistani policemen standing amongst the dead bodies of their colleagues at the site of a suicide attack in lahore where 22 police officers & four civilians were killed. side by side, there was another piece of news from who source revealing that an average of 120 iraqi adults died a violent death every day in the three years following the us-led invasion of march 2003.there is no doubt that most of those deaths were the outcome of suicide attacks. in afghanistan, palestine, sri lanka & recently in pakistan, clandestine activities of suicide squads are claiming a lot of lives with the ltte of sri lanka being the pioneer in this deadliest work. view the page international
