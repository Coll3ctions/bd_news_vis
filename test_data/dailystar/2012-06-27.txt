stand by rohingyas
we know why un is urging bangladesh to shelter the fleeing rohingyas from the trouble-torn rakhine state of myanmar. it is a clear case of ethnic cleansing. though experts have shown that rohingyas are the descendants of indigenous people, the myanmar government do not count them as citizens and there is a deep-rooted hatred for the muslims among the buddhist population there. it seems that there has been a coordinated effort to clear the rakhine state by the bay of bengal of muslims to make room for the buddhist people. we have seen how the tablig people travelling to rangoon on a bus were hacked to death in front of the law enforcing forces. we are dumb with grief at the rohingyas who face the gun and arson in their own land and tumultuous sea and deportation by bangladesh. at this juncture, the muslims as well as the peace loving people of the world must come forward to put pressure on the burmese government to investigate the human rights abuses there and stop all kinds of atrocities against the muslim communities there.
