test of hope as polls today after 7 years

dhaka slums under vigil

campaign goes haywire

curtain rises on a great day
nearly 81 million voters are expected to go to the polls today to cast their votes. in the annals of democracy in bangladesh this day is of enormous significance, it being the second time that we will see democracy being restored this time after a somewhat unusual interregnum of two years under a caretaker government and emergency rule.
the issue of war crime
the collective voice against the participation of alleged war criminals in the national election has been louder this year than before. it is indeed refreshing news that voters, especially women and the young, have become more informed of the crimes committed against the freedom loving people during the 1971 war of liberation. the more they learned about their atrocities, such as rape, looting of property, torching of houses and shooting down unarmed men, women and children, the more they were able to relate to the pain and anguish of the people. the graphic details of terror perpetrated by war criminals in support of the pakistani occupation forces that were shown on various media have instilled a sense of profound abhorrence in the people in general.
not just another election
on january 11, 2007 we embarked on a journey to nowhere and were beset with speculations and conjectures about where we were heading. amid a good deal of drama and experimentations with regard to our reformed political process, we only half believed, if at all, an election to be held before the year 2008 was out.
young voters in ballot battle
surpassing all suspicions and speculations, the country now inexorably moves towards an elected government through the december 29 balloting. this election is particularly significant as the voting takes place in a different background with a variety of changes that happened after 1/11 with a rallying cry to cleanse politics.
the secular vote bloc
standing at many intersections. what were the arguments in favour of secularism? in the 1960s, a push-back against west pakistani colonisation. in 1971, it was simply and joyfully, a decisive rejection of the pakistan model. later in the 1980s, it was also expanded to explain that religion was for private space, inner life, spiritual healing; but not for politics. now in this decade, we also insistently emphasise that religion is to be respected (because secularism's critics falsely accuse it of being anti-religion), but it should not be involved in the running of the state. view the page sports

it was not the time to watch a cricket match the day before the parliamentary elections, but still a few fans turned up at the mirpur big bowl on the third day of the first test match at the sher-e-bangla national stadium yesterday.
as good as mashrafe gets
it was breathtaking but the gasps grew louder with every delivery. the two-man slip cordon and wicketkeeper mushfiqur rahim would raise their hands in anticipation of something coming their way, but would end up clutching their heads in anguish, marvel the delivery and pass the ball around. you would lose count of the number of times this happened in mashrafe bin mortaza's fourteen overs yesterday.

level playing field?
what does a level playing field mean? does it mean to equate everybody irrespective of their virtues or vices, depending on the respective situation, add, or subtract virtues or vices as the case may be? our learned discussants in numerous tv talk shows seem to believe just that in case of our leading political parties.
flowery promises
our politics is on shaky grounds, with the major political parties playing mind games with the general people. the flowery and poetic promises are just a fake mask that they have put on their faces. however, i must praise their power of persuading the public in their favour just before election.
trial of war criminals
the alleged war criminals are in safe hands to get at least 30 js seats. the bangladesh national party in return will get full support of the jammat in their ground level election work and might get a reasonable number of seats to form government in collaboration with the jammat and other like minded parties. apparently, the chances of the al are gradually getting out of their hands.
honest candidates
if we open the tv channels and look at the newspapers, a group of people are tirelessly pleading for honest candidates. who are they? what is their qualification to be a good mp? please suggest 10 names and put them to transparent media scrutiny. also we find a funny political strategy to promote the concept of "no" vote. today we heard that more than 200 thousand local and foreign observers would observe the election. the political speeches of the two major political parties are full of promises, allegations and apprehensions of vote rigging. the political drama called "terrorism” is in full play around the security of major political leaders. the political spokesperson of the government is looking for a "transition" phase of handing over power to the elected government. the ca says it would be automatic; but none of these important persons have told the secret of their message. let us guess what it could be, again a big dose of uncertainty?
zircon in election manifesto!
zircon is unknown to most people in the country. recently the name of zircon along with other several minerals has come to the priority list of the election manifesto of one of the political parties. we know that natural gas is our national mineral resource but there are other costly minerals in the country that need to be explored. those minerals are available in the coastal regions, nearby islands and in the sands of the rivers in northern region of bangladesh. they are solid minerals known as zircon, rutile, monazite, garnet, ilmenite, magnetite etc. depending on their purity and rarity, they are worth billions of dollars and it is a case of transformation of scientific discovery into a billion dollar industry.
dropping oil prices
as the world braces for a recession whose depth and duration is anybody's guess, one silver lining of the downturn is already clear: the crisis at the gas station is over. in an economy now facing nothing but headwinds, declining oil prices may be about the only thing putting money directly back in consumers' pockets.
“no” vote
after a long wait a much coveted general election is being held today. in the aftermath of the drive of the acc against the corrupt politicians and businessmen, the nation was ready for reforms. but people saw an appalling picture of reform in the political arena.
corruption
in every socio-economic field of our country corruption has spread out as an epidemic which is severely hindering the development of the country.
to our leaders…
election is the name of a great responsibility. a political leader starts his journey with the promise to help the common people. but when people elect them, they never fulfil the promises they made earlier. the dream of common people never comes true. the acc is an institution which is working to remove corruption.
manifestos of al and bnp
lately, the awami league and the bnp announced their election manifestos with their political panache to woo the voters. though the publication of manifesto is a political rite for the political parties before the national election, it has significance in our national life.
voters' obligation
the jatiya sangsad (js) election is a great opportunity for the electorate to vote out those politicians who have made false promises during election campaigns. in the past, these politicians patronised militancy and fundamentalist forces as well. this election brings a golden opportunity for the people to reject corrupt political bigwigs who have turned bangladesh into one of the most corrupt nations in the world. for a better and prosperous bangladesh people should vote against them.
new saviour of islam!
begum zia is planning to save islam as an uncalled for saviour! the very idea defies the fundamentals of our noble religion. it cannot be tainted by the dark and dirty deeds of the bnp.
disgruntled iraqis
iraqi journalist zeidi has become a hero by throwing his shoes at us president g.w. bush. the news rippled throughout the world, people enjoyed it and took the cue. in america, canada and many other places, people made effigy of president bush and started throwing shoes at it, enjoying it very much. we heard that some people wanted to buy the shoes at a fabulous price of ten million dollars and the maker of the shoes received orders of 3,70,000 pairs, the model 271, black polyurethane-soled shoes, which have been renamed as, “bush shoes”.
ershad's idea
in line with the concept of the decentralization, i was very much inspired by mr. ershad's inventiveness to create eight provinces as a part of delegation of administrative management to the nearest point with adequate authority to address the various issues locally by the elected representative bodies, instead of merely depending on the central government. this would also be considered as a process of empowerment of the local bodies as well as serving the people in efficient ways by formulating the local laws within the framework of the central government policy, procedures and rules of business. view the page international
