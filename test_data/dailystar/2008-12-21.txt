political parties should offer a realistic vision
without our knowing it, or in any way being conscious of it, a strikingly radical metamorphosis has taken place in the composition and make-up of the electorate. roughly speaking, there are 32 per cent first-time voters making for a total of 2.3crore. the number of women voters exceed by more than 12lakh that of their male counterpart. first- and second-time voters comprise more than 50 per cent of the electorate. those who have become voters after the birth of bangladesh constitute more than 50 per cent of the electoral roll.
plot allotment application hiccup
the rajdhani unnayan kartripakkha (rajuk) will cancel its plot allotments in gazipur and uttara for individuals found to have submitted fake tax identification numbers (tins). that is an appreciable decision and we are happy to note that the organisation will be assisted by the national board of revenue in the job of identifying people submitting fake tins. given a context where individuals have been supplying false tins in a number of vital areas, it makes plain good sense to launch a campaign toward bringing the guilty to book. where the cancellation of plots is concerned, however, the question here is one of why the tins must be looked into after a decision on the allotments has already been made. the logical move here would be for the nbr to go for a verification of all tins submitted by applicants before rajuk makes its final decisions on the matter.
voting out the corrupt
the state of emergency is now over, and street rallies and processions seem to highlight the country's enthusiasm and excitement for the upcoming elections. however, the list of nominees of the major political parties, particularly of the bnp, highlights the prominence of individuals of dubious character in bangladeshi politics. additionally, the higher judiciary has allowed some candidates who had been convicted in criminal cases to contest the upcoming elections.
none of the above
like many, i am divided on the no-vote option. on the one hand, this is possibly our only way to send a strong message to the party bigwigs to nominate better candidates; on the other, there is a risk of critical votes getting wasted, since it is next to impossible that the number of no-votes will reach the threshold needed for a re-election in the constituency.

election manifesto
for the coming general election, the political parties are announcing their election manifestoes. in the meantime, the big two political parties i.e. al & bnp have already unveiled their respective charter. al has selected the slogan “charter for change” and the bnp “save country, save people”. it is not a surprise that the election manifestoes of both al & bnp are full of promises having 23 pledges from al & 36 from bnp. the promises include all aspects and expectations of the people, from eradication of corruption to ensuring job for at least one youth from each family.
trial of war criminals
it's undeniable that every history has to endure a few shameful scars, which never cease to disparage its supreme pride. as bangladeshis we must always be ashamed of the fact that we failed to prosecute the collaborators who played a key role in the genocide perpetrated by the pakistani invaders in 1971. perhaps, today i'm even more ashamed of our predecessors than these sordid traitors, since our forefathers failed to wash these scars off our glorified history. today, after 37 years, we demonstrate on the streets for the 'elusive' trial of the war criminals (as if staging a trivial drama), we watch emotional discussions on tv channels where participants ardently demand for effective tribunals and our intrepid freedom fighters hold countless meetings to boycott the war criminals from elections. at the same time, we inevitably put up with the fact that some of these infamous collaborators have served as ministers and top bureaucrats in our government administration. moreover, we get utterly surprised to see these war criminals 'indifferently' representing one of the notorious political parties (a party reluctant to acknowledge our war of independence) and our leading parties forming lucrative coalitions with these twofaced collaborators in order to win elections! this entire scenario seems to me like a trite satire, characterized by a rather nasty sense of humour. the dauntless existence of these war criminals in our political milieu has turned the tragic tale of our liberation into a 'hysterical mockery' as we imprudently gave them the opportunity to laugh at our inability to ensure justice for our nation and for those who sacrificed their lives for our liberty selflessly. our failure to punish these barefaced collaborators actually endorses the view once held by these traitors: 'the bengalis are only good at talking, not at doing'. i really don't know how we should answer our next generations, who (quite logically) might not believe our luminous stories of freedom, when they'll see people who blatantly opposed it occupying the highest ranks in our socio-political system. our political leaders have continued the perpetual blame-game regarding this issue for long and we incessantly put blames on several scapegoats. now after 37 years it's quite natural for us to be sceptic about the prospect of 'the ultimate justice'. however, we must not forget that it's never too late to bring those to justice who remorselessly assaulted humanity in the name of god.
admission in public universities
with the number of students increasing rapidly, admission in almost every public medical college and university is getting tougher.
"no" vote
in preparation for the general elections on december 29, if we take a very good look at awami league and bangladesh nationalist party nominated candidates, it may be noted that many convicts and corrupt businessmen, bureaucrats are still on the poll race. although awami league has introduced many new faces, bnp is still in favour of controversial personalities. both the parties have controversial alliances too. there are independent candidates but it appears that they do not have flow of cash and power. to judge the value of democracy, to save the nation from endless miseries, we must not vote the corrupt candidates. and if we find no honest candidates we must cast "no" votes.
farewell to bush
public shoe beating is the worst insult and ridicule to which a person can be subjected to! this is how it is viewed not only in asia, but i am sure in most of the world. the live tv pictures of bush being at the receiving end of flying iraqi shoes is really surprising, though not unexpected; given his deeds against iraq! it is the expression of the suffering of iraqis under the killing and destruction let loose by bush. given the circumstances; it is probably an appropriate farewell gift from iraq; a pair of flying size 10 shoes! i do not remember of having heard or seen anywhere near this sort of insulting or demeaning situation that the head of any state had to face, in the last fifty years or so; as long back as i can recollect! bush brought bombs on iraq; and ended up being bombed by iraqi shoes; not an inappropriate response. it reminds me of the famous lines of the poem:
no room for terrorism in islam
in islam, there is no provision to kill innocent people for any reason whatsoever. islam is a religion of peace. even in the war-field, muslims are not permitted to kill enemy soldiers unjustly. moreover, islam instructed muslims not to kill women and children even during a real war!
bnp's attitude
for the last few days bnp chairperson and her hand-picked secretary-general are issuing statements to the press to the effect that bnp would accept the election results if the elections were free and fair ! they are talking of conspiracies regarding the national polls. we do not understand why they are raising this issue now? after all ctg is helping the election commission to hold the polls in a free and fair manner and they are not stakeholders in this election.
bsf
bsf is killing bangladeshis on the border areas day after day. but except from a few corners, nobody is protesting it. the caretaker government has taken no action against it. also the sector commanders' forum is silent in this issue. we are a free nation. but the action of bsf made it questionable. we expect that the sector commanders' forum will take initiatives for trial of bsf.
bushflex
the very recent shoe-assault by the gutsy and spirited iraqi journalist has become a hotcake all over the world. people all over iraq are in some sort of festive and winning mood having caught george w. bush, the american president, on their own soil.
honesty is the prime concern
political parties launched a new way of campaign emphasizing what the candidates should refrain from rather than what initiatives they have taken or what manifestos they have submitted to the nation. one candidate says, "if i am involved in corruption, i take bribe, you should not cast vote for me. but if i don't do that, why do you not cast your vote for me?".
begum zia's campaign
begum khaleda zia, an ex-prime minister and chief of bnp has started her election campaign after performing ziarat at the mazar of a holy shrine at sylhet. in her very first call to the nation she warned the people that the country "is in deep crisis" and it is only she and her party the jatiyotabadi and so-called islamist forces can solve these crisis. she also reminded the people that "a deep conspiracy is being hatched to install a "tabedar sharker" meaning a puppet government in the country and again only she and her 4-party can accomplish their unfinished tasks if voted to power again.

harassment in zia
just few days ago my sister and her family went to zia to fly to usa with immigration visa. they have their usa visa on their passports and have got an immigration visa packet from the dhaka us embassy. this packet is addressed to the american immigration officials on arrival at the airport and nobody is allowed to open this document. this fact is known to every immigration officers in zia. unfortunately, an immigration officer from zia indiscriminately pressed my brother-in-law and sister to open that immigration visa packet. he refused to let them go until they opened it and kept them waiting. in the meantime a gentleman came from the immigration booth and asked them about their case. they explained him that the immigration officer wanted to open their visa packet. this gentleman then explained that rude man that he is not eligible to see the paper inside the packet and my brother-in-law/sister is not allowed to open it.
sector commanders' forum
it is very heartening to note that the valiant sector commanders of our liberation war have united together in a forum to stand against the war criminals of 1971 who collaborated with the pakistani occupation forces to annihilate the bengalis from our sacred soil through ruthless killing, arson, rape and what not?
pretending to be choosers?
would someone kindly explain to us why we are holding this very expensive and dangerous election? the obvious answer is that bangladesh is a democratic country and we have the power to choose who should run our country. okay, so far so good. but, if democracy is about having the power to choose your leader, then why have we been stuck with khaleda zia and sheikh hasina since 1991? yes, it is possible for a leader to get elected multiple times but only if s/he is exceptionally good. based on their 17-year performance record, do you think khaleda zia and sheikh hasina are exceptionally good leaders? this year again khaleda zia and sheikh hasina have decided that we have to choose between them. but how did the two ladies come to this conclusion? what selection process have they used to prove to us that they are the two most suitable candidates to run our country for the next five years? view the page international

observe what and by whom?
just before the 1991 parliament election of bangladesh a newly formed election observation team was visiting chittagong to put together its local chapter. a meeting of local 'neutral' civil society members was called by the founder president of that organization to discuss preliminary organizational matters. no doubt the intentions were good at that time as bangladesh was moving into a new chapter of democracy after about a decade of autocratic rule by ershad. i rose up and thanked the organizers but expressed my skepticism as to the success of such a venture. i asked them whether they can monitor the election developments in the raozan constituency till the day of election and come back in one piece. the team leader wanted to know why that should be difficult. well simply because that happens to be the constituency of the infamous salahuddin quader chowdhury and he has his own of way getting elected by intimidating the vast number of minority and poor low income voters. the organizers had no clue as to what happens there and they would be the election observers. things have not changed much in raozan and similar constituencies in other parts of bangladesh. sure enough that same election monitoring team certified that the election in all chittagong constituencies went on fine excepting few minor incidents and irregularities and certified that the results should be accepted. well so far for neutral election observation and monitoring teams and their activities.
