misinterpretation ?
i am sorry to come back again and again to the cantonment house of begum zia. her top lawyer and a high profile member of the party is very strongly referring to the constitution that empowers the president to exercise his supreme power to take action which is not covered by normal law of the country or any other law which is applicable to an ordinary citizen. i am not a lawyer. therefore, i have no intention to challenge the contention of the bnp party lawyers. but i have the right to ask for a clarification of the article concerned of the constitution. is it applicable for an ordinary citizen also ? i also do not understand when the case is between begum zia and the cantonment board, why the political party of begum zia is agitating on the issue. it means that if i have a strong political party and huge supporters i can also use them to fight a legal battle!

the photograph published on page 7 of your newspaper of 26th may, 2009 shows the simply and elegantly dressed indian foreign secretary, mr. shiv shankar menon, welcoming the new indian foreign minister, mr. sm krishna, with a warm handshake and not with a big bunch of flowers.
universities
the failure to accommodate the ever-growing number of students seeking higher education, among other things, has necessitated the government to open up the sector to non-government operators to run universities. both public and private universities have been playing a very vital role in spreading higher education across the country, baring some exception. most of the private universities are dhaka-centric, only a few have opened campuses outside dhaka to facilitate and attract a larger segment of students intending to pursue higher education on their chosen disciplines.
wasa water
about two years back our wasa undertook the business of bottled water ('shanti') like many other private organisations. they invested a huge amount of money in purchasing machineries, paying staff salaries and other overhead expenditures. although other organisations/ companies are earning considerable profits selling bottled water, wasa's loss is on the increase. but my question is why wasa has got involved in such business. their main duty is to supply water to people of this capital city through the pipeline. but many people in many areas have to remain without water. wasa's water is not pure and is risky for health. the performance of wasa is not up to the mark and thus they should concentrate on supplying pure water through a flawless piping network. bottled water is for the rich and for them there are many private enterprises. wasa is not a private company. the poor, middle income people and even the rich want pure water from wasa at a lower price. in the name of “shanti” it should not bring any “ashanti”.
where is my share?
due to world recession, the govt of bangladesh has declared several thousand crores taka as rescue package, so that the aggrieved industries or sectors are benefited to some extent. on the other hand, the representatives of fbcci, dcci, bgmea, bkmea, tanneries, agro sector etc, do often ask the finance minister, commerce minister, bb governor etc to lower bank interest rate. unfortunately, many public limited companies did manage to raise share capital indicating fatty return on investment but some of them do not pay dividends for years, some do not arrange agm, some could not be enlisted in stock markets and thus they are enjoying interest free capital for decades.
lifelines of dhaka
three cheers for the daily star for focusing every day in the front page the miserable condition of the lifelines- the four rivers around dhaka. all citizens of dhaka, irrespective of their political affiliations, should stand behind this commendable effort undertaken by your newspaper. because of this bold campaign, the honourable high court has acted in line with the aspiration of the dhaka city dwellers.
a great job
our heartiest thanks to the daily star, we laud its concern for our dying rivers, which if not revived will choke our cities. the picture revealed is horrifying, ten feet layer of discarded polythene bags and other waste materials are covering the bed of river buriganga. untreated wastes from industries are pouring into the rivers, making them severely polluted, creating a most serious situation.
are we learning?
thanks to the daily telegraph, british mps are now beginning to learn the true definition of “taxpayers' money”.
unexpected violence
the violence erupting among the followers of two sects of people in maheskhali has become intolerable. the common people are the worst victims. the recent outcome of the violence is the death of two followers of kawmi sect. though it is difficult to say clearly who is responsible and who is right or wrong, common people eagerly want a quick remedy.
traffic jams
nowadays traffic jam appears to be a big curse in our urban areas. yes, it is a common phenomenon that city people go to the market and park their vehicles on the road , as if the space of the road is their forefathers' property.
frankenstein for us?
we all know the story of frankenstein. in pursuit of vengeance and driven by self-ego, frankenstein wanted to kill his own creator. in the light of same fictional character, we have witnessed this week such behaviour from israel to its stalwart ally, the usa, through its open defiance to us proposal to stop israeli settlements on occupied palestinian lands. being taken aback by the blunt us proposal to stop further settlements on the palestinian land, israel apparently has taken a path of defiance, rather than compliance with the us proposal.
no dearth of talent
there is no dearth of talent in our wonderful land - thousands of gpa 5 students. no electricity, no water, dusty, smoky, jam-packed totally unhealthy environment where most of the valuable time is loafed off on the streets - that is our dhaka city, even then our meritorious students are making this result. compared to the students of the developed countries, our students have to work harder for this achievement. but what are we doing for them? a great shame indeed. young sweet children of the parents are being forced to go on hunger strike for the third time. a final decision should be made in time.
rajuk
rajuk has disgraced all of us. we live in england, but send money to relatives in bangladesh and wish to buy a plot of land in order to be able to settle there in the near future. at first, rajuk tells the applicants that any proof of bangladeshi nationality, will suffice, when put with the application form. and then, after many of us have already sent off our application forms, they claim that photocopies of bangladeshi passports must be enclosed alongside the application form and other documents. now, as the selection process of application forms is an ongoing process, they inform us that all passports must be valid. if they don't have this information, then they discard the applications. why, if they truly need the information, do they not request it? they have everyone's email address, they have their house addresses, and telephone numbers. they cannot simply throw away thousands of applications merely for lack of information, which they did not at first, request. a hefty list, is it not? following on from that aberration, they claimed that they would inform the general public on who had got a plot by the end of the one-month following the deadline, this turned into six months. will it turn into one year, and then two years next? we don't even have any form of confirmation, by email or by any other means that our hard-earned money has been received by rajuk. and we, ourselves have no way of confirming this. no one answers the phone on the contact number we were given, and i have personally sent people round to the rajuk offices, where they claim they are too busy to do anything, or to give out any information. these incidents have shown our character, i.e.: to be unreliable, unpredictable, and utterly an annoyance. view the page international
