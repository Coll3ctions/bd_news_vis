weekly currency roundup
june 5-9, 2011
international markets
at the end of the week the euro rose broadly as investors geared up for hawkish signals from the european central bank that would boost the single currency's yield differentials. but there was a risk of a correction in the euro if the ecb appeared dovish by flagging a slower pace of interest rate hikes later in the year, given a possible global slowdown and the lingering greek debt crisis. the single currency also rallied strongly against the swiss franc, up 0.7 percent, to 1.2274 francs. traders cited a swiss bank and us investment bank as buyers. ecb president jean-claude trichet is expected to use higher staff inflation forecasts at thursday's post-policy meeting news conference to justify the case for monetary tightening in july. but the continued possibility of greek debt restructuring, which was raised again on wednesday in a letter from german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble, meant the euro could come under pressure after the ecb news conference. the dollar recouped losses against the yen having slumped to a one-month. against a basket of currencies the dollar was down 0.2 percent at 73.812. the federal reserve's beige book summary of economic conditions on wednesday confirmed us growth slowed in may as a result of supply disruptions stemming from the japanese earthquake and tsunami. investors will look to the release of us initial jobless claims at 1230 gmt for further clues on the state of the world's largest economy, which has endured a recent slew of lacklustre data. view the page metropolitan

make the doctors accountable
though it may sound ludicrous but it is a fact that becoming sick and going to a doctor or a hospital these days has become a frightening phenomenon for the common people, because the high charges levied by them is simply beyond the means of the common public to bear with. most of these so-called posh hospitals have facilitated doctors with arrays of degrees advertised beside their names; some degrees are beyond anybody's apprehensions. these doctors are provided with plush chambers and their names are prominently exposed to different places so that they cannot escape the eyes of the patients. one of my cousins recently went to one of such posh hospitals with chest pain. he was taken to the icu right away and kept there all night and interestingly the duty doctor told his wife that the patient needed to be put with rings as they suspected that his heart had got blockages. however, going to another hospital for a second opinion, he was told that he didn't need anything; they also told him that it all started from the formation of gas in the stomach. as for the bill, my cousin paid taka 17, 000 /-, for spending a night in the icu. what a way of fleecing money from the unsuspecting patient! i wonder when our concerned authorities will correct all these malpractices and make the doctors accountable for their wrong doing!

miserable life
the opposition and the government must come to an understanding.
rising prices
the commerce minister's statement from time to time will have little bearing on the minds of common people, comprising 90% of the population of the country. the fact is that the prices of essential consumer products have increased at a geometrical proportion - 60 to 100% and still continue to rise. the common people are groaning under the heels of tremendous price hike.
failure of teachers
teachers all over the world have the same aim, to encourage their students to learn and become independent adults. i do not disagree that many teachers have personally impacted me and have inspired me to achieve heights. however, i cannot deny the negative influence few have made on not only me, but all of my peers. on a national level, the role that is undertaken by teachers nowadays is particularly worrying. with corporal punishment on the rise, i have begun to question if teachers really remember their main purpose of taking up the teaching profession. additionally, teachers have been harming students by exhibiting their personal frustration on them, not teaching effectively but limiting knowledge to books and not concentrating on the well-being of students, forcing them to join private tuitions etc. on the other hand, many students do not show proper attitude and respect towards their teachers.
in response to ….
some days ago, the world has seen a grand marriage ceremony of the majestic couple prince william and kate middleton. undoubtedly, it was a magnificent ceremony the world has ever seen. i have seen some writers are so enthusiastic in highlighting the ceremony recurrently, giving different titles like 'a royal love story', 'hats off to william and kate' etc. wishing is fine, but exaggeration is boring. bangladesh is beset with numerous problems e.g. pollution, road accident, traffic jam and so on! highlighting these things will be more helpful for the nation.
end the enclaves!

rahimafrooz solar

save the breeding ground
halda is one of the major rivers in the south-eastern region of bangladesh. it is one of the world's major natural sweet water fish breeding ground from where carp fish (ruhi, katol, mrigel and kalibaush) eggs are collected by the fishermen. the eggs are collected during april to june almost every year. eggs are hatched to produce fries, and these fries are supplied to different regions of the country. but in recent years the availability of eggs and fries has fallen abruptly. there are several reasons behind it:
utter disrespect to the dead
the current awami league government has committed a few mistakes during the tenure of their governance. it is yet again committing a serious and costly mistake by completely demolishing a shrine by constructing cemented benches, as if there is no other space available at the 1000 acre ramna park, dhaka.
gandhi on judging person

can't we implement kotler's idea?
philip kotler is known as marketing-guru especially among business students, academicians and marketing executives worldwide. the 80-year-old professor of international marketing became an icon in the academic arena and developed new concepts in marketing. from a complex phenomenon, he simplified the definition of marketing as “marketing is the set of human activities directed at facilitating and consummating exchanges”. however, perhaps he is the first person who feels the necessity for bangladesh, a country of 170 million people, to be a member of brics group. brics refers to member countries brazil, russia, india, china and south africa. the total population of these five countries is nearly 3 billion. we know that on april 13, 2011 the "s" was formally added to bric to form brics after the admission of south africa into the union. so, we hope our efficient diplomacy will turn brics into bbrics someday.
beware of limon case
may i refer to the letter published in the daily star on 6th june titled "resolve the limon crisis" written by md. shafiuddin sabuj, where the writer has claimed that he (limon) has been recorded "as being 25-year-old, but actually he was 16". my question is how come he is 16 years old being a hsc examinee at the time of the incident! does it mean he had passed the ssc examination when he was 14? does it comply with our existing act or is it possible at all? i would request the concerned authorities/departments to publish the real age of limon to remove the contradiction in this regard, and i am also requesting not to publish any misappropriate data which can create misunderstanding amongst the readers/concerned. since the top level personnel of the government has already opined about the matter and it's still under investigation with the high level public servant like additional divisional commissioner of barisal, so none should try to influence the directives of the competent authorities/government giving wrong information at this stage.
