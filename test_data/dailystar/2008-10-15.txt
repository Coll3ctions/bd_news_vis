palin, a liability?
to understand why alaska governor sarah palin will be of little help, a look at what a prominent alaskan woman thinks about her will be in order. in a column published in the anchorage daily news on sept 16, alaskan writer elise patkotak wrote: "there was a time when i thought john mccain really was a different kind of politician, one who would put the country above his personal desire for grandeur. i stopped thinking that the day he announced sarah palin as his running mate. ... sarah palin is untested and untried. there were dozens of other people much more qualified to be mccain's running mate who would not have caused people to question how ready they'd be to take over if something happened to mccain. to my mind it is fairly clear that the only reason mccain chose palin was because she brought in something he desperately needed as the right-wing, conservative christian base of the republican voters who view mccain with distrust and distaste.

pakistan betrayed ?
needless to say that mr. kabir has unnecessarily brought india into the recent us-pak problems and cautioned india what to expect from the us if it fails to honour the nuclear agreement. i see the pakistan analogy is wrong and illogical. even if we assume that mr. kabir?s analogy is right, i highly doubt that the us would start bombing some random part of india for violating the nuclear deal. but, if suddenly, indians start harbouring anti us terrorists in their territory and keep thinking that territorial integrity and sovereignty would save them from us fury, they should think again. well, who knows, what would happen to that kind of india? i am sure the us will be furious.
