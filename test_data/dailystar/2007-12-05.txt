upbeat on revenue collection
the national board of revenue has reasons to revel in substantial growth in tax revenue but no cause to celebrate. not as yet, because less than one-third of the total tax payer base of two million submitted their tax returns. and taking into account the fact that there may be several millions without tin number whose incomes are taxable and yet who have not filed their returns, the extent of tax evasion makes us sit up and take note.
recovering siphoned off money
the worries of the chairman of the anti-corruption commission are also ours. if indeed bureaucratic tangles have come in the way of a recovery of money siphoned off abroad by corrupt elements in bangladesh, then the crusade against corruption remains incomplete. hasan mashhud chowdhury informs us that owing to an absence of official arrangements with other countries vis-à-vis investigating corruption, it has not been possible so far for the money stashed away to be brought back to bangladesh. besides, an inadequacy of authentic information regarding the money smuggled out abroad has also impeded a prosecution of those responsible for such unlawful conduct.

our pride: the liberation war
in 1971 i was in my early twenties. i had my loving parents, affectionate brothers, hearty friends and also someone to love. i had enviable educational degrees and reserved seat in the coveted superior service of pakistan(selected by central public service commission). leaving this rosy life i opted for the uncertain and risky life of a guerrilla fighter, not for anything less than freedom of my nation. my father an educationist bade farewell with a single sentence "come back with honor". i could not face my mother at the time of departure.

politics in pakistan
the political drama in pakistan took yet another turn when the government finally allowed former prime minister nawaz sharif to set foot on pakistani soil. this former chief minister of punjab, who had served twice as prime minister, suddenly seems to be the hero in this game of politics in contrast with the other former prime minister who is said to have negotiated a deal with the ruling establishment. but the real question is what next?

sidr and grameen bank
last year bangladesh was in the world media because of nobel peace prize. the nation paid its homage to grameen bank and its founder professor yunus. but where is our nobel laureate at this critical moment of the country? we have not heard his voice yet, although we heard a lot about his future plans to remove poverty from the country. sidr has taken away everything from a large part of the country. the affected people's cry gives us a clear signal as to what they need now. grameen bank has a large network. since it has been given nobel peace prize, let us listen from it how the sidr affected people can lead a peaceful life in future. only tin-shed katcha houses are not the solution. these people need at least one well built pucca house in a family which can stand cyclones like sidr.

loyalty or vested interest?
about 15 to 20% people of this country actively participate in politics. except for some minorities, most of them from top leadership to grassroots level activists involve themselves in politics for their own vested interest. eighty percent people of this country were being exploited under the pre- 1/11 corrupt political system. after 1/11 a new era of hope has ushered in. but this new situation has brought misery for most of the political activists. sensing their political demise, they are desperately trying to save their supreme leaders, most of who are corrupt, so that they can preserve their old corrupt political system. for this reason they are showing blind loyalty and support to their supreme leaders. nation's interests come last to these political activists. but they should by now realise that their days of exploiting this nation has come to an end under a sham democracy. no matter how hard they try they cannot turn back the clock before 1/11 and deceive this nation any more.
a story of 1971
“hum namaj parega, roza rakhe ga, hum musalman hai etc”. this was the urdu reply of my father who was a 60 years old, influential village man with no knowledge of urdu at all. he had to prove that he was a muslim to a squad of pakistani soldiers who were led to our home by a group of razakars. one of the members of razakars was my father's brother-in-law. my poor father could not satisfy the brutal pakistani soldiers by his poor urdu about his muslim identity. he was trembling with fear. while the squad was leaving, one of the soldiers hit my father by the butt of his gun on his chest. the pain of this hit on his chest persisted till his death. he was complaining about the pain and i still feel that if i could found that soldier i would have killed him. even if i face him today, probably i will hurt him if i can't kill him.
eid-ul-azha and people in distress
