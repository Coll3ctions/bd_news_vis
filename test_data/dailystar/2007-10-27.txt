jamaat denies its anti-liberation role
we reject with unreserved repugnance the claim of jamaat's secretary general ali ahsan mohammad mujahid that jamaat-e-islami never worked against our independence struggle and there is no such thing as war criminals in the country. he said this before media displaying veritable arrogance and ire when asked about the role of jamaat-e-islami during the nine-month bangladesh liberation war of 1971. to our utter shock and indignation, mujahid not only denied any wrong-doing by his party but was defiant enough to throw a challenge to the newsmen to dig into the history and find for themselves the role of jamaat.

damage has already been done
new delhi and islamabad are trying to salvage whatever is left from the recent deals they have had. india has put its nuclear deal with america on hold in the hope that the passage of time would whittle down the opposition. pakistan has a bigger problem because president general pervez musharraf's deal with benazir bhutto to have a joint rule has gone up in smoke in the wake of terrorists' attack on the welcome throng that went to greet benazir. he proposes to have an interim government with her nominees to lessen the dent. the blame game is, however, on, both in india and in pakistan. but there is nothing to suggest that either the manmohan singh government at delhi or the musharraf government at islamabad have given up their respective deals. it is not foolhardiness that makes them resurrect the battered deals. it is their long-term thinking. both manmohan singh and musharraf honestly believe that the paths they have chosen are the best for their countries.
charland and right of the landless
charlands in bangladesh is a unique asset. this extensive stretch of resource can play an extraordinary role in reducing poverty of a huge number landless people of the country. but till date government not being in absolute control of the charlands and most of the these being in possession of a section of land-grabbers and not properly distributed among the actual landless poor, the effective utilisation of thousands of acres of charlands in overall poverty reduction and economic growth of the country could not be achieved. specially because hundreds of acres of land due to alluvial accretion in rivers not being included in khas khatian and not handed over to the actual landless through proper distribution, no expected result has been found in rural poverty alleviation. but proper and correct utilisation of charland could have set a considerably positive trend in effective alleviation of rural poverty. view the page sports

he would forever remain 'the groom' in my memory. i never saw the man in normal attire, or ever again, except on his wedding day in that clownish uniform, which is the traditional garb of bengali-muslim bridegrooms. at least, i thought it clownish then, because men of that era, without benefit of role models among cinema heroes who now swagger equally in traditional or western attire, were neither able to carry off the long, cream sherwani coat and tight pajamas with grace, nor balance that crown of turban and garlands without looking as if it were a basket of vegetables to sell. they didn't even have the confidence to refuse the kerchief that they were made to put against their nose as if warding off some bad smell.

technology has changed, by degrees, the face of journalism throughout history. the invention of printing machine, telegraph, camera, radio, television, satellite, computer and lately internet and cell phone have had a profound impact on journalism. the impact is realised through changes in the mode of news collection and presentation, determination of objectives of journalism and the relationship between media and society. vincent campbell in his book, information age journalism: journalism in an international context, has measured how information technology has influenced journalism. the theme is curious because we all live in the information age which determines our patterns of thought and action in a distinctive way.
