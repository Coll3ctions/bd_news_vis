women's policy detractors
we are saddened and worried that in the name of islam some people have been trying to create confusion around the issue of the proposed national policy on women. in many ways, it is a repeat of what these very elements tried doing recently about the education policy, a move that created some unnecessary confusion. now when a progressive step is being taken to ensure that bangladesh's women enjoy equal rights with men politically, economically and socially, these extreme elements are busy spreading the false notion that the proposed policy goes against the quran and sunnah. it does nothing of the sort. indeed, we are outraged that where islam once caused a positive transformation in people's thoughts and even now symbolizes equality and self-esteem for all men and women, some quarters are happy to convey the impression that islam stands against granting equal rights to women. nothing could be further from the truth.

saturday's stupendous feat in the world cup final made mahendra singh dhoni india's most successful captain in limited-overs cricket, having won both the world twenty20 and the world cup for the cricket-mad country. so, hardly could he hide his emotion. usually self-reliant, the indian skipper was as delighted as he could be though he laughed nervously at times at a post-match briefing in the underground media conference room of the wankhede stadium. most of his answers were either long or like skipping the question with a joke, and his motto was: enjoy the night first.

bring them home
it is very unfortunate to find so many bangladeshis stranded in tunisia and libya after having endured great sufferings while fleeing from a war-torn nation. while they suffer, the bangladesh government makes no sincere and hurried efforts to get these citizens back home which is a matter of great disgrace. even iom is saying that the govt. of bangladesh is half-hearted in its efforts to take back the citizens. i urge upon all to raise their voice in support of these stranded fellow citizens and if need be, launch private efforts to raise money to get these people back home. too bad, the nation can spend billions to showcase icc - it can not spare dimes when it comes to looking after its stranded citizens.
a fabulous tournament!
it's a matter of great delight for us that bangladesh has successfully played its part in hosting the cricket world cup 2011. we have once again proved that despite being an impoverished nation, we have the capability of producing world-class outputs if given an opportunity. this magnificent event has also given this tiny nation a great deal of international exposures that we truly deserved.

response to mr alamgir khan's article
we are writing in response to mr alamgir khan's article “the other side of microfinance”. in it he queried what the sources of our literature review on the impact of micro-finance were. we sourced our evidence from published research on micro-finance in bangladesh, using material from researchers based in bangladesh and those abroad. since the list of references is too long to reproduce in a letter of this nature, we would like to point to two papers which provide the details of each of the points made in our article along with their exact citations. these two overview papers are khandker, s. (2005). “microfinance and poverty: evidence using panel data from bangladesh.” world bank economic review 19(2) and zaman, h (2004) “the scaling up of micro-finance in bangladesh: determinants, impact and lessons” world bank policy research working paper 3398. we hope readers find these papers helpful in assessing the impact of micro-credit on the poor.
abolition of capital punishment
amnesty international and other human rights organisations' observation that the country should move towards the abolition of capital punishment is a clear evidence of recognition in principle at the highest quarters that there can be no rational justification for that extreme penalty in a democratic state. their views represent the current thinking across the world. although bangladesh's law prescribes death penalty for crimes such as murder, abetting mutiny by members of the armed forces, and waging war against the government, it is in cases perceived as particularly gruesome and politically sensitive that the extreme punishment is awarded. in our country, the justice system works in such a way that of the criminals caught, a very few get convicted. though abolition of capital punishment is welcome, the government should not tie the hands of justice in dealing with heinous crimes.
lack of professionalism
i was saddened to learn of the passing away of veteran politician and bnp secretary general, khandker delwar hossain, in singapore. i rushed to see more detailed news. however, i was confused by the conflicting information on two popular websites, the websites of the daily star and bdnews24.com.
whose fault is this?
we need to listen to the bangladesh bank governor. as it is bangladesh bank who removed prof yunus from grameen bank, they should defend it, not the finance minister and the attorney general.
removal of prof. yunus
we understand from various reports that majority of the general mass desire that professor yunus will be treated honourably. i have a proposal on how to bid farewell to dr. yunus as the outing managing director of grameen bank.it was published in the newspaper that the tenure of chairmanship of the existing chairman of grameen bank is going to expire in april 2011; (if i am not wrong) dr. yunus may be allowed to continue as the managing director of the bank till expiry of the tenure of the chairman of the bank and after expiry of the service contact/appointment of the present chairman, he may be made the chairman of the grameen bank if he accepts it at all.
folly of decision makers…..
sir ian kershaw, a military historian, wrote 'fateful choices' about the decisions taken in the second world war, contrasting those made in the democracies compared to those made by hitler, mussolini and stalin…..
road grabbers!
in most of the residential areas of dhaka, a portion of the road is grabbed by the unscrupulous house owners. and perhaps mohammadpur is the worst affected. the house owners while building their houses grab a couple of feet from the government road. unfortunately, none is there to see it and this unlawful activity hugely contributes to the traffic jam. but if government wants, they can bulldoze these illegal structures just by one week and get the roads back to the original size. this has been possible in mirpur recently prior to the world cup and the scenario is totally different now. let's free all illegally grabbed areas for a better dhaka!
vandalism and our sufferings
the rickshaw-pullers' revolt against the traffic policy of the government by vandalising hundreds of vehicles, causing sufferings to commuters, school children, sick and old has left the nation stunned. the general public of this country have had enough. the insufferable traffic jams cannot be addressed because the rickshaw-pullers don't want it. if governments, be it the al, bnp, jp or jamaat, are incapable of protecting the life and property of its citizens, then democracy has failed in this country and we should look for other alternatives.
obama disappoints!
when barack obama was elected us president, i, like many others, thought he would help the palestinians win their just rights. but he seems to be following the path of his predecessors by extending all sorts of support to israel allowing them to do whatever they like from killing innocent unarmed palestinians to stealing their land by building more and more jewish settlements. this is really frustrating.
let us build a better bangladesh
bangladesh, though a poor country, yet it is characterized by a vibrant parliamentary democracy, independent judiciary and election commission and a free media. in addition, the people of the country exercise all fundamental human rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and the right to information. we hope our country will soon develop in all sectors. view the page international
