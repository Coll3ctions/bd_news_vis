important elections today

people-police cooperation
we fail to understand why the bangladesh police ordinance 2007, an instrument of immense importance, should at all need advocacy for its implementation. with the spectre of crime and criminality not showing any sign of going away soon, we feel the sooner the ordinance is promulgated, the faster the force will become effective in maintaining law and order in the country. it is true that making the instrument effective would also help bridge the gap between the people and the members of the police force, which we believe is vital for removing certain misgivings in the minds of the common people. there is no denying the fact that common people are often subjected to harassment both inside and outside police stations, which at times crosses the boundaries of civility and the concept of human rights.
bnp blowing in the wind
viewed purely from a political angle madam khaleda zia's release from detention is a logical sequel to the freeing of sheikh hasina a month ago in the name of treatment abroad. after all, the compulsion for doing so, if any, on the part of the ruling dispensation is the same. the prospect that the madam also will be released soon in a similar manner has already been on the cards. the release of coco, one of her indicted sons, seems to have put the process in motion.

thoughts on elections
sitting thousands of miles away, watching 2 satellite television channels and reading the daily internet edition of more than 10 bangladesh newspapers, my conclusion about the “over promised” election being organised by the military backed government is that it might not bring any positive change. just to inform our readers, i am also educating myself on democratic values watching the full coverage of the us presidential election process and campaign on major television networks, although i know that one would be more frustrated if one ever tries to compare the two situations. nevertheless, it is raising our expectation to see more civil-democratic order in our country. unfortunately, the impact of our deliberately mismanaged state affairs is just opposite. that is why i see all efforts of the ec and the government have made the general election look very “ugly”. the reasons why i say ugly are:
poorly paid teachers
on july 27, 2008, mr. suranjeet debnath wrote a very good article on the poor salary of community school teachers in bangladesh. sometimes i wonder if i write any article whether that would have any impact. though i am not optimistic about it, i still write and try to convey the message. i am surprised to see that the teachers are getting salary of tk 1,200 per month, after months of agitation and hunger strike. this monthly salary can only buy 30kg rice at the current market price. if this is the case, how could these teachers and their families survive? what are the top level government officials doing? does anyone understand the impact in the long run? does anyone care about this situation? it seems to me that government decision makers do not care about educating our children in the rural areas of bangladesh, because most of the top decision makers live in the capital city or district headquarters. they work in air conditioned rooms, live in government houses, use government cars, get good retirement benefits and educate their children in good urban schools. it is very unfortunate that these government officials are completely out of touch of common villagers and perceive themselves as the masters. i think our government officials must be retrained to change their attitude to become servants, not masters of the people. like dr. barakat, i strongly feel that the salary of the primary school teachers in rural areas should be increased for the sake of ensuring standard education. view the page international
