politics hinders education at cu
it is with deep shock that we read the news item highlighting the ordeals of general students at the chittagong university. in the past two years university authorities suspended classes for no less than 151 days due to violent clashes between politically backed students organizations. in the last instance in february this year, two students were killed following a clash between bangladesh chhatra league and islami chhatra shibir and the authorities put off all classes and examinations for 37 days. a university which should have been an ideal place for learning through free exchange of thoughts has thus been subjected to a tug of war between different students' organizations, leaving the general students at their mercy. view the page sports

observing march 25 in a befitting manner
march 25 is a red-letter day in the history of bangladesh. on the night of march 25 in 1971, the pak occupation army let loose a reign of terror on the people of dhaka. on that day and the days that followed millions of people were mercilessly killed all over the country. the way march 25 is celebrated in bangladesh is perhaps not correct.
no to tipaimukh dam
“we would not allow india to construct the tipaimukh dam, if it adversely impacts on bangladesh,” the prime minister sheikh hasina told a rally organised by the awami league-led 14-party grand alliance at the government madrasa ground in sylhet city on march 24, 2012. in the rally she also mentioned that her government has already told india to include bangladeshi representatives in a feasibility study group to look whether it would adversely affect bangladesh and about the assurance of india that they would not do anything harmful for bangladesh. it is difficult to understand why the prime minister is in doubt about the adverse impact of the said tipaimukh dam. she should realise the simple fact that all rivers, canals, mountains and hills, mangrove forests or even the deserts were created by the creator for the benefits and survival of all living creatures on earth and any alteration in this arrangement of the creator is bound to impact the environment in any form or other.

neutrality of speaker in js
the speech of abdul hamid, the speaker of the jatiya sangsad (js) at the concluding day of the twelfth session of the ninth parliament sangsad on march 29, 2012 has surprised us. the way he delivered his speech accusing the leader of the opposition (especially his body language) gave the impression that he was speaking as the leader of the house and that he was not at all neutral.
bcb should complain
i believe bcb is completely right in complaining about the incident that took place during the final match of the asia cup. mahmudullah's complaint was genuine and the umpire even warned the pakistani player about the obstruction. if this was intentionally done, then this was not the first time pakistani players did this against bangladesh. during a previous tour when bangladesh was playing in pakistan, rashid latif had to cheat to win against bangladesh and only after bcb had lodged a complaint, he was stripped of his captaincy and removed from the team. if the bcb does not put this incident on record now, i believe this will happen again and again.
democratic principles trampled
we have never seen in our life a political party in power uses so openly and daringly all the power at its disposal to thwart simply a political rally called by the opposition! the government actions centering round bnp rally of the march 12 have left such a negative impression on the public mind that many of them now consider the ruling awami league as a fascist party in a democratic garb. in a democratic set-up, can a government trample basic democratic principles under foot in this way?

the prime minister is not the only one who is worried about the use of indecent language in parliament. we all are. when not so long ago two women lawmakers from the opposition bangladesh nationalist party went for an indecent assault on the person and reputation of sheikh hasina, it was a whole nation that was left reeling from the shock thus engendered. here we were, at home with our children and grandchildren, watching the proceedings on television. those two women left us with red faces before our families. it was the eyes of the children that said it all. is this politics? that was the question they seemed to ask. and we had no answer but a load of shame to offer them in response.
