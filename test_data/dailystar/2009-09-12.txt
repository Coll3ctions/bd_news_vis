a new beginning in bangladesh-india ties
the agreement reached in delhi by bangladesh and india through bilateral talks between the foreign ministers of the two countries is clearly a breakthrough. we welcome the many positive signs coming out of the talks. from an economic and political perspective, the results are pivotal for both the countries. the broad agreement reached on some key issues sets the ground for more positive development in the near future. the agreement on transit to nepal and bhutan, and the commitment of 100 mw of power are two immediate steps that are likely to benefit bangladesh in the very near future. there are several other areas, where detailed planning and quick follow-up are necessary.

optimism is a moral duty
there is every reason to be pessimistic about relations between india and pakistan. one is determined not to resume talks until it sees the perpetrators of the mumbai attack on november 26 last year brought to book. the other is stuck on the stand that new delhi has not sent it “enough evidence” to pursue a viable case in the court of law, particularly against hafiz saeed, the chief of jamaat-ud-dawah, which was earlier known as lashkar-e-toiba. saeed has been the bone of contention for a long time, in fact, after he was set free at kandahar in exchange of indian passengers hijacked by his men. home minister p. chidambaram has said that pakistan is “playing with our emotions” in not detaining saeed. chidambaram has given more details to islamabad, how saeed masterminded the 26/11 and was accompanied by one 'major general sahib' (probably a retired pakistani officer) during a meeting with kasab and other terrorists at a training camp. view the page sports

poetry penned in captive land
it was in rangoon in march 1981 that i had an unusual experience. my shy and retiring son of sixteen, who more than justified his nickname, which means 'one lost in reverie,' suddenly broke his silence to demand that i publish my scribblings done over the previous three decades. it was exceedingly strange and not a little gratifying that what was always in the nature of a monologue was sought to be given the stamp of irrevocable finality. it was a rare pleasure to find that one so young had been delving into the meaning of things and, out of filial loyalty perhaps, ascribed some merit to ancient and yellowed manuscripts.

she does not call
the little girl i first saw in 1962 died last week. she was too young to die; and i was too cruel not to receive her calls, those desperate yearnings for conversation that came from her. she was not extraordinary in that accepted sense of the meaning. and her education stopped at a point where it should not have. but she remained, all her brief life, a vibrant girl who kept telling me that she had grown into womanhood. easy was our banter and light were the battles we waged on the telephone. she called every day --- and she kept calling because i was not willing to talk. she did not, would not give up. when finally i did pick up the call, meaning to reprimand her for calling so many times, it was her plaintive voice that acted as a mellowing agent for me. a sense of her loneliness calmed me a little and i laughed with her. she was happy. view the page star health

karen armstrong in focus
while reading this book, i could hear the whispering of my intuition telling me that such a work most probably has not even been produced by someone subscribing to the faith of islam. one is imbued with awe from the very beginning, that is, by reading the allusion that goes with the title of the book itself, till the end where the author upholds her conviction that the world in the 21st century is so full of turmoil and aggression that unless and until the muslim and western worlds strive to understand each other and act accordingly, the only planet we inhabit, which is one and the same for everybody, is very likely to crumble. she goes further and says, 'a good place to start is with the figure of muhammad: a complex man, who resists facile, ideologically-driven categorization, who sometimes did things that were difficult or impossible for us to accept, but who had profound genius and founded a religion and cultural tradition that was not based on the sword but whose name - islam - signified peace and reconciliation.'
