tigers go down roaring
pakistan denied bangladesh the celebration of the biggest moment in their cricketing history when they beat the hosts by two runs in the nerve-wracking asia cup final at the sher-e-bangla national stadium in mirpur yesterday. pakistan enhanced their reputation as masters of the big moment by clinching the asia cup for the second time after first achieving it in 2000 in the same city but at a different venue, at the bangabandhu national stadium.
so close, yet so far
there was hardly a dry eye yesterday across the country.

bangladesh should have won
pakistan shouldn't have won this match given the modest total that bangladesh had to chase and given the form bangladesh has shown throughout the tournament. therefore, it was a match for bangladesh to lose and it lost. that was the supreme irony of fate that befell the passionately cricket-loving people of bangladesh.
student-trader clashes in old dhaka
wednesday's violence involving jagannath university (jnu) students and the traders of patuatuli in the older part of the city that led to the death of a janata bank employee is unfortunate and shocking. view the page sports
'sometimes it works, today it didn't'
mushfiqur rahim is an emotional man. after the tigers fell only two runs short of what could have been the country's greatest sporting accomplishment, he broke down. he kept his head on shakib al hasan's shoulder and just wailed and wailed. it was probably because his trusted slog fell on the lap of nasir jamshed when the team needed 47 runs from 30 balls. or it was probably because he let shahadat hossain bowl that final over which went for 19 crucial runs. he was probably crying because mahmudullah riyad and abdur razzak couldn't take nine runs off the last six balls of the game.
small issues lead to big loss
apart from a few thorns on their side, some of the cricket played in the asia cup final has been nothing short of exhilarating. the sher-e-bangla national stadium witnessed its greatest game of cricket and the packed house was thrilled at every turn and chicane.
smooth operator
a friend of tamim iqbal says that he doesn't really chart out his milestone celebrations. "it's not planned, he just does it on his own. he has never really talked about it," said minhaz uddin khan, a childhood friend who also happens to be a sports reporter.
pace is gentle enough
don't measure bangladesh's bowling performance by only focusing on the final over of the innings. shahadat hossain conceded 19 diabolical runs off the 50th over to give pakistan a shred of momentum they dearly required towards the end of their innings in the asia cup final at the sher-e-bangla national stadium yesterday. it is an aberration;
late arrivals and the shakib hat
it was perhaps a bit of a surprise to see half-empty stands at the sher-e-bangla national stadium when bangladesh took the field for arguably their biggest match till date, the asia cup final against pakistan yesterday. the stands did begin to fill up slowly, with the stadium taking on the look of a full house only at the end of pakistan's innings.
'public holi-afternoon'
yesterday was a different day altogether because of the final match of the asia cup between bangladesh and pakistan here in bangladesh. before the tournament started no one would have dared to think of a final between these teams. but as the days progressed, the tigers portrayed themselves as a much improved bunch and earned their place in the title match just rightfully. they turned the table around to beat world champions india and runners-up sri lanka on the way. and suddenly they emerged the favourites, at least for the bangladeshis.
president, pm & leader of opposition cheer tigers
putting all their busy schedules on hold, prime minister sheikh hasina and leader of the opposition khaleda zia took time off to cheer the bangladesh cricket team on in the asia cup final against pakistan at the sher-e-bangla national stadium in mirpur yesterday.

focus on rehabilitation, lorgat advises aamer
mohammad aamer must go through a process of rehabilitation, including educating himself and others about the perils of corruption, and not focus on the reduction of the ban imposed on him by an icc tribunal for his involvement in spot-fixing, the icc chief haroon lorgat has said. lorgat also said the icc rules do not allow for a reduction of the five-year ban and stressed the importance of respecting the verdict the independent tribunal had reached.
two runs too far?
the tension was for many reasons, primary one being locating a venue which has a tv screen showing cricket, any cricket. tough call in a city where premier league football reigns supreme.
hafeez hails tigers
on paper, no matter how well they played through the tournament, bangladesh versus pakistan in the asia cup final was a mismatch. but the way pakistan celebrated after they won the match by the narrowest of margins, two runs, showed exactly how much the win meant to them and the amount of respect they had for bangladesh as opponents.
