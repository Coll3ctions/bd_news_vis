hc directives on water we drink
with the citizens quietly suffering intake of polluted and stinky dhaka wasa water at great risk to their health, it remained for a human rights and environmental body called human rights and peace for bangladesh to petition before the high court for civic justice. consequently, the hc taking cognizance of the gravity of the public interest issue has issued a couple of directives to the government for getting water supplied in certain specified areas of the city tested by appropriate authorities. of course, it is for dwasa to supply potable water to the city dwellers but there are certain testing authorities that are supposed to periodically check on the quality of piped water.
billboard collapse in gulshan
the tragedy resulting from the collapse of a billboard in gulshan on monday raises a number of serious and pertinent questions. the incident has left two individuals dead and quite a few others injured. there have been similar incidents in the past as well and what happened after those incidents is that business went on as usual, with no one in authority worried about the need for corrective measures to be taken. now, where the matter is strictly one of a putting up of billboards, it is clear that no specific rules are being followed and in fact the city corporation has adopted a policy that obviously does not take matters of public safety into account. billboards are often put up at the most unlikely of places and in such a manner that they can collapse any time. moreover, the corporation and the firms putting them up simply ignore the dangers that arise from such a cavalier attitude. no technical assessments regarding billboards and hoardings are made. what does become glaring to the eye is that crass commercialization is at work, with dcc only too happy to permit any business firm to publicise itself in any way it likes. view the page sports
tigers show their grit
when bangladesh captain shakib al hasan turned up for the post-match presentation, the small crowd at the zahur ahmed chowdhury stadium welcomed him by clapping. the performance of the all-rounder in the first test was nowhere near expectation. rather his poor decision to field first on a placid track had added some extra burden on the young bangladesh skipper. the surprise 'retirement' of rokibul hasan on the eve of the match didn't help shakib's cause either. so, it was his team's fighting spirit that went someway in quelling the pressure on shakib despite the fact that they went down by 181 runs. also, some decent batting performance from tamim iqbal, mahmudullah riyad, ton-maker junaed siddiqui and none other than mushfiqur rahim re-established the claim that 'this young side is improving.'
cook pleased with win
it was yet another comprehensive test victory for england against the tigers when they posted a 181-run win in the first test at the zahur ahmed chowdhury stadium yesterday. but without any doubt the success didn't come easy. if someone is still apprehensive about bangladesh's ability to push their opponents in the five-day game then he or she would be better advised to listen to alastair cook's summing up the tigers performance.
high praise for duo
junaed siddiqui slammed his maiden hundred and most importantly played an ideal longer-version innings but it was wicketkeeper batsman mushfiqur rahim who hogged the spotlight after his back-to-back half-centuries in the first test at the zahur ahmed chowdhury stadium.

democracy
democracy is a system of government in which people choose their rulers by voting them to power. although we have passed thirty-nine years after our independence, still we don't see real democracy. according to abraham lincoln, democracy is a government, of the people, by the people, for the people. we believe this statement is true.
alarming development
in the last two decades, there has been an alarming deterioration in the cultures within medicine. prescription of unnecessary and expensive drugs, insistence on irrelevant tests and unnecessary hospitalisation have become common. costly scanning procedures are used more for extracting money than for diagnostic purposes. it is time doctors restored the glory and nobility of their profession.
“plague syndrome”
i was trying to find the right english translation for the bengali word “marak”, which pretty much describes sudden and rapid spread of deadly disease in crops or poultry. anyway according to the “online bangla obhidhan” the english translation of “marak” is “plague”. therefore i have chosen this word to describe a recurring phenomenon in the bangladesh cricket team in recent past. i will call it the “plague syndrome”. whoever is following bangladesh cricket for the last few years is not supposed to be unfamiliar with what i am trying to say here. as per this “plague syndrome” we have been watching a wave of wicket-fall (basically one after another within a very short time) right after the fall of an important and early wicket. most of the times it can be attributed to carelessness and apparent lack of commitment of the top order batsmen. there is no doubt that the bangladesh team is full of talents and it will also be pretty harsh to say that the players don't have commitment to their country. however, when it becomes a routine in match after match there must be a problem. cricket is a game of uncertainty but that doesn't mean that players won't assess the situation and chalk out a strategy and play responsibly. i think the cricket board and the players should take this seriously and try hard to find a way to avert this phenomenon again and again. i am not an expert on cricket but i love my country (like millions of other fans) and want my team to get out of this humiliating situation.
volatile share market
it gives me immense pleasure to go every morning through the financial pages of the daily star where the trading of shares are printed in detail. almost every day some write-ups concerning the various issues on share are coming up. lately, a lot has been written about grameen phone shares. both sec and dse are airing their news and views about the share of grameen phone and numerous mechanisms are being tried to contain the upward trend of the issue.

mockery of mock test
in july, 2008 a renowned english medium school suddenly changed their curriculum from edexcel system to cambridge system without discussing their decision with the parents/guardians of the concerned students. the school administration first signed the contract with the university of cambridge for the gce o level then informed the parents/guardians. a few of the renowned english medium schools in dhaka city have also switched to the cambridge system but they had trained their teachers through a series of training programmes organised by the cie prior to switching to the new system. they also discussed the pros and cons of the cambridge system with the parents/guardians a number of times before taking the final decision. unfortunately, the school mentioned above did neither. they never sought the opinions of the concerned parents/guardians treating their students as guinea pigs while they threw the innocent students into a new system of which the school authority had no clue. the school administration warned their first batch of students (appearing the cie gce o level in may 2010) that their mock test questions and answer scripts would be sent to the uk to be examined by the cambridge authorities and only the successful candidates would be allowed to appear in the gce o level examinations to be held in may 2010. to our utter surprise, we discovered that the questions of every subject of the mock test, which commenced in mid february 2010, were exactly the same as those of the gce o level examination held in november 2009. in fact, the school authorities merely "photocopied" the questions downloaded from the internet. the school authorities didn't even bother to remove the date printed on the footnote of the original examination. now the students are just memorising the answers of the questions of november, 2009 overnight and spewing them out on the very next day. this has become an absolute mockery.
renaming zia
name sometime matters, if not always. especially, while naming important state organisations, no government is expected to go for controversial names, let alone those of the erstwhile military dictators. again, when the apex court of the country declares the regime of a particular military dictator as illegal, it becomes incumbent upon the government to follow the verdict in letter and spirit.

it appears that turkey is passing through a silent revolution; after the great kemal ataturk set the country on the course of development. centuries earlier the ottoman empire contributed to the development of europe; and now turkey finds it necessary to turn east, as the eu has now turned into the slow lane.
hsc exams
the exam schedule which has been published by the board of secondary and higher secondary education is not suitable for the candidates. for instance, the routine of the science group can be cited. there is no gap before biology 2nd paper (zoology) exam. the students will come under tremendous pressure.

tarique vs. joy
in bangladeshi political arena cheap propaganda, cheap controversy and exchange of cheap diatribes are very much common. people here not only enjoy such debates, they create tempest in the tea pot. the on-going debates could be heard and feuds could be seen between the two groups everywhere, at least for some time, as and when such interesting issues run in the field. the new interesting subject is tarique vs. joy. everyone knows who are they. both of them are our future leaders and they are being groomed to be our loving and people friendly leaders in future.

wasa affairs
the parliamentary standing committee on the lgrd ministry expressed great dissatisfaction regarding service to consumers of water. as a consumer, i am sorry to point out that wasa compels the consumers to practice unfair means relating to wasa bill payment. the revenue inspector is the sole authority to dictate wasa bill tariff since domestic consumers are to pay tk. 141 for one cubic meter of water against tk 461 for the same one cubic meter of water for commercial consumers. wasa supplies water through one water meter to a building whatever may be the number of consumers of different categories. the consumers are unaware of their individual consumption while the rates are too high comparatively for commercial consumers. when the government is determined to curb corruption, the lgrd ministry may devise some means so that consumers are not victimised in any manner. further, self billing like titas gas may be practised.
callous guardians
very recently, yet another innocent life was taken away by road accident in dhaka city. the incident is even more tragic as it occurred right in front of the deceased hamim sheikh's school. but we are stunned to see the indifference of the guardians of the students of the same school to the risks posed by violation of traffic rules.

hope amidst angst
he could have spent the rest of his life in darkness. losing his eyesight at the age of two due to a botched operation for a tumour near his eye and his parents the same year, life might have been one endless night for subhash dey. instead, tended by his two elder sisters, he went on to complete his studies and pursue his passion for theatre. today he is a talented theatre professional and an integral member of the kolkata-based anyadesh group theatre of the sightless.
talent hunt for reciters

‘medal’ for killing caesar shows at british museum
a unique gold coin celebrating the assassination of julius caesar, which may have been worn as a boastful talisman by one of the emperor's killers, went on display at the british museum on march 15 -- the ides of march, marking the 2,054th anniversary of his death. view the page op-ed
he remembered faces, recalled names
you could keep talking about bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman. and you would do that because of the fundamental human qualities that defined his being. he inhabits our consciousness in all his largeness of form and substance, and not just in the figurative sense. tall for a bengali, he gave us all to understand that in him subsisted all those traits which underline the making of a political giant. his height mattered. so did his convictions. he was larger than life, in every sense of the meaning.
israel's threats come from its policies
it is astonishing how israel takes america for granted! last week, as vice-president joe biden was visiting israel to jump-start the so-called "peace process," which in reality is a code phrase for all process and no peace, the israeli interior minister blindsided him by announcing the construction of 1,600 new houses on palestinian lands in east jerusalem.
an appropriate arena
i'm happy about what's been happening in the bangladesh parliament over the last two weeks. not ecstatic. happy. this is why; politicians shouting obscenities at each other in parliament is far superior to them shooting at each other on the streets.
corruption, shame and embarrassment
it is rather sad when a community or a nation becomes degenerated and reaches a stage where people do not feel shame or embarrassment for having accumulated dirty wealth. the point of no return is reached when society accommodates the corrupt and wealthy, and people feel proud to be related to, or friends of, those who are visibly corrupt, and even feel elevated if they are only acquainted with them.
why not?
on march 10, the daily star 's op-ed page article, "a new face," caught my attention. the article discussed prime minister sheikh hasina's decision to enroll her only son joy as a primary member of the ruling awami league in rangpur. the second line of the article posed the question: "but was this in any way a surprise to anyone?" be that as it may, my question is: why not? this young man comes from a legacy of political leaders and his grandfather bangabandhu is the founder of our nation. who better than him, if he has the charisma paired with intelligence and a desire to move the country along to a modern era?
