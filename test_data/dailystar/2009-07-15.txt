escalating crime undermines citizens' faith in law enforcers
there has been a clear, steady decline in law and order all over the country. the degree to which crime has been going up has once more been manifested by the brazen manner in which a group of gunmen stormed a market in the city's mirpur area on monday, leaving a person dead and eight others injured grievously. in fact, it appears that as the days go by, criminals are increasingly getting the upper hand, so much so that even the administration is clearly at a loss as to how to tackle them. and this failure to tackle them has of course to do with the rapid return of many or most godfathers of crime who had during the period of the caretaker government either fled the country or lay low. this latter point is buttressed by the thought that returning criminal elements associated with the ruling party may clearly be playing a role behind the rise in crime.

tipaimukh and experts
quite a lot has been said about the tipaimukh dam in india, waiting to be, perhaps, commissioned soon!
what are we doing?
we are a great nation indeed! not only we break the rules, disobey the law, destroy our environment and corrupt our very own systems, but we also are a nation of insensitivity. god has endowed upon us great natural resources and with our brutal actions we are wiping out the natural assets one by one. we have already destroyed chittagong hill tracts, the sundarbans is still too indomitable to be destroyed by us and we are almost on the verge of destroying the natural beauty of sylhet. the latest example of our wonderful and sensible nation's “love for environment” is the destruction of 15,000 trees in sitakunda. if not for the environment, we could have at least thought of ourselves, from practical viewpoint. we all know that trees are extremely important, especially for the seacoasts to protect the land from storms and high water tides. like the sundarbans has stood tall like a fortress during tsunami and aila. the ultimate fate of this country is sealed, and we are just facilitating the end to come sooner, we are a country which is going to be devastated by natural calamities and end up being submerged into the sea.
tipaimukh
tipaimukh dam is a much talked about issue in our political arena nowadays. it has become “political football” in bangladesh. we all know that india is going to construct a dam on borak river that will certainly be a death trap for bangladesh. if india constructs this tipaimukh dam, the greater sylhet and mymensingh regions of bangladesh will turn into desert. the surma and the kushiara will dry out that will wreak havoc on the environment of bangladesh. a colossal climatic disaster will ensue in the north-eastern part of our country. the environmentalists and the members of civil society are protesting this move vociferously. the mass media are playing a pivotal role in this regard. but unfortunately, the bnp, the main opposition party, is trying to gain political mileage from this issue.
cyber crime
the development in it is wonderful. along with these immense advantages, we are facing computer related problems like virus, hacking, e-mail spoofing, computer vandalism, pornography, money laundering and so on. they are called cyber crimes. the spread of this crime has become a matter of global concern & a challenge for the law enforcement agencies. computer is used as an instrument to commit crime.
embankment
the government wants to realise some taxes from untaxed money to support development in such important sectors like power, infrastructure and ppp. for the last few days, several learned intellectuals have been interpreting these terms in their own ways, some parliamentarians have also registered their names in this exercise.
rain and load-shedding
rain is the ultimate solution to minimizing load shedding in our country! i have noticed that we get whole day supply of electricity whenever there is rain. so, we should believe rain could be the ultimate cure to this long-term load shedding problem that the people of this nation have been suffering from.
schools or public nuisance?
i would like to draw your attention to the following matters that deserve urgent attention of our relevant authorities. although these have not yet grown out of proportions but they certainly have all the potential of becoming so, if our city planners do not pay any attention to them now. i am approaching you as i feel very encouraged by the awareness that you have created by your efforts in saving our rivers. your endeavours have already won laurels for you and all of us can see that these are producing very good results. our government has given full support to your efforts.
saving energy
for many years, the people of bangladesh have suffered due to frequent power cuts and power crisis. the country is suffering due to insufficient energy sources, corruption, and rapid growth of population etc.
unconstitutional?
i draw the attention of the people who are experts on general and constitutional laws to the provision of bangladesh constitution in the article 8 (2) that declares that the 'fundamental principles of state policy' "...shall not be judicially enforceable." now we know that the supreme court of bangladesh, in response to the famous case, ordered the government of bangladesh to implement the separation of the judiciary from the executive and made sure that the government obeys. will i be wrong if i say that since the separation was enforced judicially, it was unconstitutional?
we appreciate
congratulations to you and the daily star for winning the national environment award 2009. we appreciate your bold effort in writing against greedy, unscrupulous land and river grabbers, encroachers etc. this practice has been continuing for a long time in the absence of active monitoring. view the page international
