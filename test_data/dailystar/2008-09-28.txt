south asia in trouble
lately, the noise and disorder levels in south asian countries have risen, especially in the countries forming the former british india-- india, pakistan, bangladesh, nepal, sri lanka. it is curious to note that this could hardly be a coincidence. if there is a blueprint behind in the background, one would not be surprised.
dhaka warriors in icl
the recent drama with the cricketers and the bcb officials regarding icl is creating a huge controversy. i have got mixed feelings about the whole issue as i see strong points both in favour and against these players. i will try to share my points of view and concerns which are solely my personal opinion. i don't expect everyone or anyone to agree with me; i am just trying to bring a different perspective into the issue:
polythene coming back
it is matter of great concern that the polythene bags have staged a comeback after a gap of six years. thanks to the strict measures taken by the authorities, the production, supply and consumption of these bags were brought to a minimum level. consequently, the environment became a bit cleaner. but of late the situation has taken a turn for the worse .
hizbut tahrir protests
we note with grave concern that the daily star, in its issue of sunday, 21 september 2008, carried a misleading editorial regarding hizbut tahrir bangladesh. the editorial is baseless and clearly motivated. on behalf of hizbut tahrir, we register our protest at the editorial. the following is our response to some of the comments made in the editorial in question.
acid throwing
on 16 september another barbaric incident of acid throwing took place. this time the victims were a two-year-old infant ashiqur and his mother. the baby was seriously and the mother was partly burnt. it was utterly shocking news.
fuel prices
when fuel price was higher in the global market, the govt. increased the price to reduce its subsidy. and we are the worst sufferers. our monthly income or salary was not raised. now in the global market fuel prices have gone down to 97-100 $.
load shedding during iftar
it is no better a government than its predecessors. the ctg was supposed to set examples of capability and efficiency and clean out all corrupt practices! now it seems that they need cleaning up badly; while we head on towards god knows where. living behind the gulshan first market, our power is shed regularly without fail for the last fortnight promptly at 6:00p.m., and comes back when they wish. we break our fast and offer namaz in total darkness! this iftar time blackout for us is religiously sustained by desa. for the rest of the day, power availability is at the mercy of the power distribution centre. continuous power, an essential service, has now become a scarce rationed item that brings back childhood memories of rationing in wartime calcutta in the early 1940s! even then, however, except during air raids, power was always there!
health policy
very recently i read an article on '' updated health policy ''by farhad mazhar. we are surprised by the fact that the task force has been sent to dg health office and at the same time health policy has been updated in favour of multinational companies. very confusing steps. there was no discussion with conscious citizens. i watch all the channels of tv including btv. why this confidentiality? we are also not against privatisation in a controlled way. but preserving the rights of mass people is very important.
crackdown on hizbut tahrir
the crackdown on hizbut tahrir has apparently proved the fact that many militant outfits are still active in bangladesh, which can be a potential threat to our sovereignty in the future if they are not nipped in the bud at the earliest possible time. regrettably, three of the men arrested were 'respectable university teachers', who are supposed to be our ideal role models. we should carefully underscore the fact that these people have the scope and ability to influence the youth and they are capable of persuading them to adopt their destructive principles. it's also perplexing to wonder how such an extremist group was allowed to exist in our progressive political milieu, even after so many fatal terrorist attacks that virtually shook the foundation of our national security. similarly, i don't understand why in a democratic nation this fundamentalist group should be allowed to hold a press conference and permitted to announce an audacious ultimatum that demanded the release of their detained associates within the next 48 hours, who were actually convicted of drawing the foundational blueprints of multidimensional terrorist activities. don't we have any standard codes of law and order in this country? it really doesn't matter what enlightened principles these 'overexcited' people are adhering to. the 'means' they have chosen to achieve their objectives should be viewed as absolutely unacceptable in this liberal era of democratisation.
enforcement of traffic rules
too often we hear complaints of insufficient laws and rules which contribute to the chaos and nightmare on the roads of bangladesh in general and dhaka in particular. i would rather contend that whatever rules we have are not enforced, resulting in the arrogant attitude of drivers and owners. i have driven in the us for over 14 years and 9 years on the streets of bangladesh. i have been ticketed in the us for changing lanes too abruptly and for driving above the speed limit. however, the streets of dhaka are more like jungles of africa, where hordes of animals roam the plain freely, than the streets of a modern city, where traffic laws would rule the roads and courtesy should rule the hearts of the drivers. being ticketed for changing lanes without signal is a joke. instead of writing a long article on what is wrong and how to fix it, which would probably end up being a 10-chapter book, i list five violations for the police to look at...let's start somewhere...
flood affected people
although the rainy season is a blessing for us but it is not so all the time, particularly when floods occur. at present, many places and roads have gone under water due to floods. many people have already lost their homes, cattle and crops.
hypocrisy
how can we relate sociology , politics, religion and economics to each other? i am a bit puzzled.
undue favour
to favour a student illegally is one kind of corruption. every student should be judged on his or her performance, what he or she achieved in the exams or any other evaluating task. of course judgment should not go over the essentials.
education
today parents are spending more time and money for their children's education. even in a village a farmer is found sending his children to nearby school or any educational institution. this is a positive and pleasant picture in bangladesh.
a failed mission?
has our caretaker government headed by dr. fakhruddin ahmed failed in its mission?
only two?
i wrote a letter titled, “back to square one” that was published in the daily star on 9 july, 2008. view the page international
