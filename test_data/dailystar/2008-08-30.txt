a middleclass diary*
when i was born, a nurse at the holy family hospital laid me beside my mother and smilingly said, “your daughter is very fair. when she grows up, she'll be so pretty that nobody will be able to take their eyes off her.” my mother was overwhelmed to hear it; that moment was one of the few happiest ones of her life. she used to tell this story at dinnertime on almost all my birthdays, her face lighting up with joy. however, as i grew up, my complexion started turning darker and darker. then mother would tell the same story with a certain melancholic strain in her voice.

stockholm syndrome
on a drizzly november afternoon we set out for sweden. stefan (the hubby) and i thought about driving to the airport and leaving the car at the airport parking. driving is a darn easy job for me these days. couple of years back when gps was freshly seen on the shelves of handful of doohickey stores and a few gutsy gadget inquisitors was testing them out i joined them. previously a timorous driver, i now cruise through the interstate routes, catching up with the occasional change of radio stations as the car radio goes out of range from town after town. i love it, and do not get lost any longer. but stefan and i ditched the idea of driving to the airport and instead chose the yellow line, the q train, since we were only two blocks from the station and had little luggage. aboard the plane we survived the airline rations and the parody of pretend night, morning and then almost pretend breakfast as if we had a whole evening, night and morning all in seven hours.

* do not infuse guilt via moralising or losing your temper.
* try and understand the addict and make him/her feel that you care.
* be patient. do not look for shortcuts. recovery takes between four to six months.

two governments, a war and memories of a teacher
the war for bangladesh continues to be a major concern for people intrigued by the history of the indian subcontinent. and then there are people, notably in pakistan, who would rather look away from the 1971 story largely because of the deep embarrassment it still causes them. for one thing, the war signified a break-up of pakistan through its eastern wing reasserting itself as the independent republic of bangladesh. for another, it was a military defeat for an army that had always prided itself, however delusionally, on its bravery in the battlefield. in 1971, that bravery was sorely tested before the mukti bahini, the bengali guerrilla army, and then the indian army towards the end of the bangladesh struggle for liberation.
condemned by fate, persecuted by politics
milan kundera's the unbearable lightness of being is an exploration into the philosophical concept of lightness, used in ontology and associated with existentialism. nietzsche's doctrine of eternal return is used to illustrate lightness. the idea, according to kundera, is 'a mad myth.' its reverse shows that 'a life which disappears once and for all……does not return …is like a shadow without weight.' life's 'horror, sublimity and beauty mean nothing.'
