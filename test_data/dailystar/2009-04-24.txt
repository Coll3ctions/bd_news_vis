an eye for the obvious

sunken vessel at chittagong port
the capsize of a clinker-laden vessel in the estuary of the river karnaphuli on tuesday has brought all shipping movements at chittagong port to a virtual halt. the seriousness of the situation can be gauged from the fact that all medium and large vessels are now unable either to leave or enter the port. that not only means a stop to all maritime activities but also promises to leave a bad impact on the port economy. for the ships stranded at the port, the chittagong port authority (cpa) will lose $10,000 every day. and if the port is not cleared soon, a huge logjam will be created with the arrival of more ships from various parts of the globe. the clearance, of course, involves salvaging the sunken ship with a sense of immediacy in order for the port to get back to working order. the question, though, is whether the cpa is equipped to do the job.

strong statements
the wisdom ahead of this tournament as experts tried to compare and contrast indian conditions with those in south africa was that the new ball was going to be crucial. here, finally, would be the chance for indian premier league seamers to get their own back after last year's succession of subcontinental shirt-fronts left them desperately searching for creases and rivets. and it's true: the new ball has indeed been crucial. just not in the way people expected.
a welcome win
it really didn't matter that pakistan chased down their target tonight with all the assurance of a one-legged man roller-skating in quicksand with his hands tied behind his back. it only mattered that they chased them down at all, even if at one stage it seemed misbah-ul-haq was bent upon wresting his countryman's hold on the longest international innings of all time.

a bamboo bridge….
the photo shows the back of saadat university college, one of the first five university colleges of the country. it was established in 1926 at karatia, tangail by wazed ali khan panni, a renowned zamindar and educationist of karatia, tangail. it is widely known as karatia saadat college. sadat college is the first college in bangladesh established by a muslim zamindar. the founder member of saadat college was principal ibrahim khan. he was the first chief executive of the college. he worked in the college till 1947. the college was upgraded as a degree college in 1938. in saadat college, the honours course was commenced in 1966 and the masters course was commenced in 1974. the government of bangladesh announced the saadat college as a national university college on july 7, 1979. it has honours programme in 16 subjects and masters programme in 10 subjects. this university college is well recognised as a postgraduate college. more than fifteen thousand students, both male and female from different districts, come to this renowned university college. the college has three entrances; two of them are all right but the problem is with the 3rd one. hundreds of students from college para as well as neighbouring areas have to go to college every day using this bamboo bridge. this is very risky for the students as well as senior citizens.

traffic congestion at shyamoli
i would like to draw the kind attention of the dmp men who are managing transport to and from shyamoli crossing to adabor. every morning, at around 8.00am, i used to face a serious jam at shyamoli crossing while coming out from adabar area by car due to huge influx of cars, microbuses, mini buses, large buses plus rickshaws. this is the peak hour. so, all the people in and around shyamoli crossing need to go to offices, schools and to their respective destinations. it is very surprising that there is a useless road connecting adabor ring road to mirpur road near the bus counters, the road is blocked by some pillars at the end approaching mirpur road. so, no t vehicle can go through it. why is this road not usable? if this road is opened, then the problem of traffic congestion in the area can be eased to some extent.
pajero for upazila chairmen
it is reported that our government is going to purchase. 480 pajero jeeps, one govt transport each, for 480 upazila chairmen. the price of one pajero jeep is taka thirty lakh. what would be the total prices of 480 pajero jeeps?
goblin of militancy
the govt has been trying hard to eliminate the roots of militancy from the country. but it should in the meantime have realized that it's not possible only by force. an intellectual warfare with religious extremism plus the hands of law can do that. but there's another thing no less important. what are people witnessing? the hooliganism and anarchy of the activists of the ruling party and its different wings is gradually becoming intolerable. together with these, the atrocities of load shedding, water-crisis, inaction of different agencies in combating problems are pushing the people to the brink of sudden outburst. the godfathers of the ruling party are dauntlessly flouting law and its strong (?!) hands. the leftists are emerging with renewed vigour. the leftist leaders are making hay during the present rule just as the fundamentalists had a heyday during the previous govt. how long will the people go on witnessing these helplessly? by too much clamouring about the 'jongees' some quarters are trying to divert people's attention from the govt's failure to rein in their partymen's do-whatever-we-will. this is very ominous.
spirit of pahela baishakh
needless to mention that pahela baishakh is the part and parcel of our culture and heritage. on this day both urban and village people celebrate it in keeping with their age-old tradition. i feel proud to be part of this rich culture. indeed, baishakh is no longer a culture of bangladeshis, rather it is the embodiment of more than 250 million bengalis across the world. in one sense this day is a bit different from other days. for instance, it has broken the boundary of religions, races, clans and political belief as well. all the people celebrate it with a unique identity-- “bengali”. but the pleasures turn into a great regret when we come to see that this spirit and solemnity of baishakh has been transformed into capitalistic pursuit and simply a daylong formal occasion.
school feeding programme
recently, i happened to be in a primary school located at a remote village of patuakhali district and i saw students were being served with biscuits under the school feeding project of wfp. this is certainly a noble act of the world food programme for this developing country where over 40% of the total population are considered hardcore poor. therefore, this initiative has definitely created a very salutary environment in school education, particularly in prevention of drop-out at early age or in the middle of school year and added nutrition value.
air pollution
asia has the world's highest concentration of two and three wheelers, both in absolute terms and as a fraction of overall road vehicle population. in many asian cities, these vehicles account for 50 to 90% of the total vehicle fleet of which a large percentage are powered by two stroke engines. the main pollutants of concern from 2-stroke three wheelers are hydrocarbons and particulate matter. most three-wheeler owners, operators and associations are not willing to accept that they have a problem, which makes it difficult for governments to take action.
bcl and prime minister
there have been a lot of embarrassing unwanted student activities in the public colleges and universities. the bangladesh chhatra league (bcl) is reported to have started occupying halls, collecting tolls, manipulating government tenders and harassing opposition student fronts. this sudden change of behaviour of bcl has embarrassed the prime minister who is the chief patron of her student front-- the bcl. to bring her students under control, she has distanced herself from the bcl.
hazari cadres

state of the nation
further to my letter on the subject last month, it is a source of great disappointment for all to see that we are heading for a free-fall in future with those in power sitting on the sidelines without a clue, but at the same time willing to wash their hands in the flowing ganga. the beady, seedy and greedy eyes are glowing as the economy of loot rapidly takes hold. view the page international
