elephants of bangladesh
elephants of bangladesh are starving. the forests of bangladesh have become smaller in size and are no longer typical rain forests with various types of big and small trees and plants which provide abodes and food to varieties of birds and animals. these have been replaced by jungles of several varieties of foreign trees which can be used as firewood for brickfields, domestic purposes, curing tobacco and making inferior quality furniture. the photograph of elephants eating water hyacinth published in your esteemed daily recently is heartrending. emaciated and starving elephants are being compelled to change their ancient food habits. they are now making forays into villages situated in the outskirts of their natural habitat, at times killing or injuring villagers and destroying their thatched homes. on the other hand, thousands of acres of fertile paddy fields in the valleys in hills remain untilled because of fear of elephants. the net result of this situation is sufferings, of both elephants and humans. sincere desire of the govt. and a meticulous planning and vigorous, coordinated action by the ministry of forest, ministry of agriculture and law enforcing authorities could correct this intolerable situation.

obama's birth certificate released
recently the white house has released the long form of president barack obama's birth certificate in response to festering questions about whether he was born in the united states. production of birth certificate by an american president to prove his american citizenship and to confirm his president candidature is really unfortunate. i cannot believe to have such a treatment in a highly civilized country like the united states! had obama not been born in the united states, how he received the majority votes? was he a stranger to his supporters? meanwhile i warmly appreciate president obama's initiative to end the on-going debate over his birthplace and i sincerely wish his success in the office of the president.
osama and obama
abbotabad will open, not a can of worms, but a barrel of venomous serpents. a deluge of awkward questions will follow. the picture, shorn of all verbiage shows an unarmed middle-aged man shot to death with admittedly only his wife resisting, while other wives and a dozen children were mute spectators. it is irrelevant that his head had a price-tag of $ 25 million, allegedly for a crime that he was never formally charged with, tried or convicted in a court of law. but is it irrelevant, the killers were one nationality, came from another country and completed their 'contract/supari' in a third? what happened to the “sanctity of national boundaries”? where is the “sovereignty of independent states” that the 'civilized' countries love to teach? extra-judicial killings are nothing new. the young puppy has been doing it with impunity for years. now the tail is wagging the dog!
