fine showing
the astounding success achieved by the bangladeshi sportsmen in the recently concluded south asian games is worthy of praise. the sportsmen have showed what patriotism and dedication can do when you are determined to succeed. we should not get carried away with the outstanding achievement by those players and rather sort a way out to nurture them to compete in higher sports levels. less developed countries are unable to utilise the talent of their strong performers and/or tend to lose them before they blossom fully.
traffic mess
good heavens!! 10 lakh motorised vehicles (mvs) on dhaka's scanty roads with a capacity of 1.5 lakh mvs only (ds headline, 7 feb)!! and i have been quoting a figure of only 4-5 lakh gas guzzling monstrosities (ggms) for the last 30 months.
man made disasters
man-made disasters are taking thousands of lives every year. earthquake, fire, road accidents all those are most familiar words to us. but still we are not correcting ourselves.
banners, posters everywhere
there has been a flooding of banners/festoons and posters across the metropolis lately. the mushrooming of these banners and festoons continue unabated, much to the disappointment of citizens. nobody seems bothered.
campus violence
again, we have observed bloodletting on our university campuses and ugly politics in public run universities and affiliated colleges is a sad reflection on the achievement of these educational institutions. no matter what the basis of student politics is, ethnic, political, ideological or religious, regional or even academic, the fact remains that it undermines academic pursuits and discipline in educational institutions.
hazardous roads
there are frequent road accidents and physical injures done to boys, girls and pedestrians at sher-e-bangla school/dawn garment factory point on folder street, wari of jatrabari-gulistan one way busy rote which abounds with hundreds of motor vehicles and manually driven carts.
bank services
the telephone bill can be paid in more than 140 bank branches of the country as printed in the telephone bills but wasa bills or electricity bills or gas bills can be paid in one or two bank branches only. as a result, it is very difficult for consumers to pay bills. when bb governor has time to distribute bank loans to cultivators or terminal peasants, it should be correct to receive bills of various categories in banks.
a unique country!
i wonder how many countries are out there in the world, where politicians demean, ridicule, criticize their armed forces like they do here in bangladesh, i guess there is none.
sad, indeed
it is very sad indeed to see reports of violence on public university campuses in the country. a university is not merely an educational institute where students go to attend lectures. it is a learning hub where young minds are nurtured and trained to make qualified individuals- something very important for the development of a nation in the global stage. it is very disheartening to see the learning environment of prestigious institutions like du and ru being damaged through on-campus violence by groups of students affiliated with different political parties. there is a limit to which responsible citizens of a country can tolerate such nonsense, and i believe it is about time the government started taking some serious action against the culprits.
student politics
recent activities of college and university students, spanning several months, and all over the country, are the greatest testimony to a serious rethink of all patrons whether or not the students wing of their party should exist.
justice for the poor
while we were young we heard our elders (murubbis) saying, "if you want to harm your rival you either convince him to marry a second time or engage him in a court case". this means, if a man brings home a second wife, daily quarrel and loss of peace in family life becomes a routine matter and the man starts living in a hell. similarly, if a man is engaged in some sort of court case and if it is a 'dewani mamla' (case on land dispute) he is involved in a never-ending problem in his life. i have seen how a man used to travel to the district court every month and return home every time with a new date. we have seen many people died before the case was heard and justice was delivered by the court.
bcl goes berserk
we are stunned by the bcl activists who drove out at least 500 students from satkhira city college in connection with admission trade introduced by the bcl for making quick money. now educational institutions have become battlefields where bcl factions are fighting for supremacy and common students have become victims
violent politics
non-political students die because of the clashes between political groups where they never have any role to play at all. the tense situation in different educational institutes across the country is nothing but the by-product of dirty politics.

rahim shines
i hope that cricinfo's recent analysis of batting performance by our top order batsmen in the 9-10 tests participated since october 2008 caught the attention of our cricket selectors (http://www.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/446095.html). in descending order, it shows the following averages (runs per innings): mushfiqur rahim (40.58), tamim iqbal (35.00), shakib al hasan (31.83), junaid siddique (23.82) and mohammad ashraful (16.84).
language issue
i thank syed badrul ahsan for his article on 'bangla…the way it was'. i assure him that it is just as painful to me to hear so much english being spoken badly in bangladesh as it is for him to hear bangla spoken badly! there is, indeed, the danger of developing a mongrel language that is not worthy of either because, in neither, is the art of true literacy taken seriously….. view the page international
