last year hindus observed durga puja with enthusiasm. it was possible due to the enabling presence of the present caretaker government, which went a long way in erasing the scars created after the 2001 october parliamentary election. last year many people's prayer to god was if this could have been the permanent scenario of the different religious communities of the country!!
kali o kolom
the ashwin issue of kali o kolom starts, appropriately enough, with three articles (by rafiq kaiser, sarkar abdul mannan and abu hena mustafa enam respectively) on mahmudul haque, the bengali short story writer and novelist who died recently. sarkar's lucidly-paced piece fills in many of the gaps of haque's life--the writer grew reclusive and tired of dhaka literary life in the last twenty years of his life and his life became shrouded in the mystique of authorial silence. rafiq kaiser elucidates the author's fondness for characters who were lumpen, rootless and of what used to be called the 'lower orders,' while enam examines the modern element in his fiction. a previously unpublished short story by mahmudul haque, asroy ('shelter') has also found its welcome way in the short story section, which also contains an alluring contribution (’ kosha ') by papri rahman, whose use of 'vernacular' language and raw-earthy idioms is striking. the other short stories are 'palki’ by niharul islam and ‘ desh jokhon naiye ' by sharshij basu. there is a tribute to the writer mahmood darwish, the 'voice of palestine,' who also died recently and whose death went relatively unmarked in the literary pages of bangladesh dailies (including this one). accompanying it are some of his poems translated into bengali, though it is not mentioned whether they are double translations (translated from english translations of the arabic), or straight from the arabic. art reviews are getting to be a major part of the fare provided by kali o kolom , with poet-architect robiul husain becoming a regular contributor. in this issue he dwells on the 11 indian and bangladeshi artists who had a show at the gallery kaya recently. this issue too covers two probashi artists, one in japan and the other in the united states, while zahid mustafa writes on nurul islam's solo show at bengal gallery.

at tilted shelves and fallen theories
text his travel agent
fly to london in a rage
his brooding beard a-twitch
to type theses on dhakabach ?

they hit the wall
fall flat
crawl back to the pit that's bred them…

fighting vision impairment in later life
word sight day (wsd) is an annual event of awareness which aims at raising global attention concerning the current reality of 300 million people living with blindness and vision impairments worldwide. it is coordinated by international agency for the prevention of blindness (iapb) under the vision 2020 global initiative. this year's wsd was on october 9 and it focuses on the ageing eye, and vision impairment in older people. the headline of the theme "eyes on the future" and strap line "fighting vision impairment in later life" recognises — in a world where populations are ageing and individuals are living longer, blindness from chronic conditions are also on the rise. by 2025, there will be twice as many as older people worldwide as there were in 2000.
coordinated approach needed to eliminate avoidable blindness
there are many reasons why hundreds of thousands of people across the country become blind. the unfortunate tale is that the majority of them suffer from either preventable or easily curable blindness. proper intervention or surgery can help them to regain the precious gift of sight. dr m a muhit, an eminent bangladeshi ophthalmologist, who is currently working as the clinical research fellow at the university of london’s international centre for eye health has shared his views with star health on blindness issues in bangladesh.

road map for peace in iraq
finally george w. bush at the fag end of his second term in white house has responded to the calls to approve the plans of troops withdrawal from beleaguered iraq. only god alone knows whether bush's attitude has been prompted by the pressure of the tormented, frustrated, and 'getting poorer everyday' people of iraq, afghanistan and palestine and the kith and kin of the coalition soldiers deployed there.
politics has no military solution
zulfiqar ali bhutto in his hey days as pakistan's prime minister in the early 1970s had said that there is never a point of no return for politicians. a politician is never finished till he/she is dead; in fact charismatic politicians influence politics even after they are dead. bhutto should know it for with his own political career, he has established this truth. even after his death, his name lives, carried by his daughter benazir and now her husband who has become pakistan's president based on the legacy of bhutto. two military dictators have failed to wipe out the legacy.

memories gleaming in autumnal light
serajul islam choudhury was one of the luckier ones in 1971. or was he? he moved from place to place, from one home to another, in the knowledge that the pakistan army would not let him out of its sights. he could have done the easy thing, something that quite a few expected him to do. syed sajjad hussain and syed ali ashraf, both of whom had preceded him in teaching and both of whom had feelings distinctly kindly toward him, offered him teaching positions in west pakistan. the idea was simple: pakistan's military establishment needed proof that choudhury was loyal to the state, that indeed he had nothing in common with the rebels who had opted to wage war for an independent bangladesh.
a death --- and turbulence in the family
poor people around the world have the same tale to tell, the tale of poverty. the poor can be poor to a level when they cannot get any poorer. this is a tale of such a family, a family that is torn between its wants and abilities. the family passes days and nights with its back against the wall. the egyptian author naguib mahfouz portrays the story of a poor family in egypt around the mid-1940s.
the passions in poetry
poetry is more precious than other branches of knowledge, according to famous critics and scholars throughout the course of history. when religion, science, philosophy, astrology and other branches of knowledge fail to provide a protective shield to humanity, poetry comes to the rescue.
