how public is public opinion?
all opinion is not public. this is one reason why public opinion polls so often get it wrong. some sections of the indian public -- generally, the less confident -- prefer to keep their views to themselves, partly out of a nagging fear that the establishment might react adversely to a hostile opinion. and partly out of a sense of property rights in a democracy: why should anyone else know what i think? let them find out when they check the ballot box. instead of leading the opinion pollster towards the broad truth, the voter might even deliberately mislead. view the page sports

river erosion and water logging
firstly, i would express my solidarity with the writers and thank them for their concern about such issues. unlike the developed countries, these are the havocs intensifying day by day in the developing countries like
mangoes or poison?
we are horrified to see the detection of tones of mangoes ripened with extremely harmful chemicals such as carbide. what are we taking in the name of mangoes? are we poisoning us and our future generations to gradual painful death? this is a clear case of poisoning the entire population which warrants capital punishment for the offenders. but what a mockery of justice, the offenders were only served with three months' simple imprisonment! is it the right kind of punishment for a crime of such magnitude? anywhere in the world the perpetrators of such a horrible crime would get death sentence without any question. we have seen pouring of chemicals (poison) on fish, bananas, grapes and pineapples indiscriminately by the criminal traders, but only this time we have seen that even mango and jackfruits were not spared. this malpractice is going on unabated due to the weakness and time consuming procedures of our legal system. imagine, only three months' simple imprisonment for poisoning the entire population! we demand immediate amendment of the law and severe punishment to the criminals. otherwise, those greedy criminals in the guise of traders will never stop such dreadful activities.
good results, but…
beaming faces of the students on the front page of the newspaper : this image shows that the students are over the moon as they have achieved a good result. to be more precise, this year 52,500 students have got gpa 5 in the said exams. and the pass rate is also very healthy : 71.81%,which is more than the pass rate of the previous year.
maturity is not their hallmark
i am a cricket lover and i do not miss any game featuring my country. i get inspired when i see our boys playing a competitive game. there is loss and win in every game, so losing a match does not disappoint me so badly if it is a well contested one. i have been watching our cricket from the beginning of its attaining test status, but i do not find any marked change or improvement in its quality. i am pretty sure that our boys are still in the same place where they started from.
admission in college
the results of the ssc exams were published recently. the students and their guardians were very happy. but now parents as well as students are worried about admission in college.
“can bangladesh make it alone?”
i take this opportunity to thank you very much for publishing my write-up on assessing the realities of our country's maiden journey into the world of international shipbuilding & heavy engineering under the aforementioned title (forum).
realise the truth
before 1/11, the four-party alliance was all set to participate in the 22/1 election. the al led 14-party coalition was forced to remain away from it. but the bnp led alliance was ready to take over as a one-sided election was going to be held where they couldn't lose! but things are different now.
measuring credit worthiness
credit is a necessary component in all sectors of commerce and industry. inefficient use of credit is one of the main causes of poor credit management. in these continuously changing sectors of trade, commerce & industry, it is very much important to ensure availability of credit. in a country like bangladesh it is more important to increase credit availability to build smes, which play a vital role in economic development.
problems of sau
the sher-e-bangla agricultural university (sau) is located in the heart of the capital city. it started officially in 2001. in fact, the sau has come into being through the upgrading of bangladesh agricultural institute (bai) which was established on december 11, 1938 as “the bengal agricultural institute” by sher-e-bangla a. k. fazlul huq, the then chief minister of undivided bengal, which later became “east pakistan agricultural institute”. regrettably, the teachers and the students of sau are facing many problems due to lack of some required facilities.
sense of humour
the bengalee sense of humour is much older than that of the now materialistically-developed western civilization (classical knowledge and wisdom travelled from the east to the west; now in the 21st century there is reversal of the sine wave: relocation from the west back to the east). now both the west and the east have to meet and live together, in this squeezed global village. in the hot tropics, bo [body odour] is present in epidemic form; hence the daily bath--we have to patronise our 300-plus rivers! a land overflowing with the bounties of nature--don't blame the begums.
biman's irresponsible act
i was one of the passengers of biman's dc10, flight no. bg 022 which was coming from muscat via chittagong on july 3, 2008.
ctg's u-turn?
though this caretaker govt. is not an elected one but it got the silent support of the majority. the start was very good. it began to materialise the dreams of people by revealing the corruption of our patriotic (?) elected leaders. not only that, it compelled those golden sons & daughters to confess to their guilt and go to jail thereafter. the common people didn't say anything against it, rather they appreciated it. it made us believe that no criminal would go unpunished.
why bring in the mughal ruler?
shaista khan was a general cum governor of bengal during the mughal period. we know about his military adventures and good governance. it is said that the price of 8 maunds of rice was only tk 1 during his rule! perhaps, it was not that good news for rice growers. but people in general were happy. but there is no mention in the history that he had any liking for lighter side of life, like jokes etc.
accidents
it is now common news for all of us. road accidents are taking place every day. but nothing is being done to reduce the number of such accidents.
communicative english
what is the purpose of introducing 'communicative english' in the educational institutions? the learners can learn the english language easily using dialogue. in the light of it, it can be said that the english books of different classes, especially for the classes at secondary level, prescribed by the national curriculum & textbook board should be written in a simple language as well as simple sentences. i would like to highlight the book of classes 9 -10 (english first paper) only. there are many long sentences in this book, which are really very difficult for the students to learn. some topics of the book where these sentences are found are mentioned here. such as the voice of women (unit-18, lesson-2), a letter from nottingham (unit-9, lesson-3), the international mother language day (unit-18, lesson-3) etc. on the other hand, there are also many mistakes in this book. correction of the mistakes is a must and the sentences should be shorter. moreover, there are 100 marks for english first paper in the ssc exams every year and the students are to answer the questions on the basis of that marks. but it is a matter of regret that all the questions are not set up on the basis of that subject only. some questions like rearranging of sentences, substitution table, vocabulary test etc. are taken in the question paper from other books, though the first one is taken from the textbook at times.
sau's location
this refers to the letter(11/7/08) written by prof. zahidul haque dismissing my proposal to shift sau (sher-e- bangla agricultural university) from its present location to a new countryside location. shifting/ merging an organisation to a better place or with a same type of institution (say, with bangabandhu agricultural university which has only master's, ph. d. level programmes)could be quite desirable if it is for serving the greater interest of society or nation, saving public money.
fuel and food prices
in your article on the world bank analysis that bio fuels have pushed up the prices of food, you observed that high food prices have caused riots in bangladesh.
iodized salt?
