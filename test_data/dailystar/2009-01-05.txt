ershad leaves his fate to hasina

al gets better power sector to build on

biman sees profit at last
after four years in the red and decades of mismanagement, the fact that bangladesh biman has posted an operating profit of tk 19 crore for the 2007-2008 fiscal year is welcome news and deserving of congratulations all around.
sri lanka crisis deepens
we note with concern that as the strongholds of the liberation tigers of tamil eelam (ltte) are beginning to fall one by one following close encounters with the sri lankan government troops, the number of deaths of civilians is also mounting alarmingly. the air raids that the government forces are conducting to flush out rebels are reportedly taking a heavy toll. suicide bomb attacks on soft targets unleashed in colombo by a splinter group of tamil tigers are also contributing to more civilian deaths and destruction. we fear that whatever the outcome of the military engagement, a major humanitarian catastrophe is well under way, including displacement of people in the battle-torn regions. this is likely to result in a refugee problem in the near future.
democracy's great leap forward
in spite of the mixed signals emanating from the media outlets, an al victory was assured -- given the party's qualitative edge over others, at least on the eve of the election -- but its landslide vis-a-vis bnp's total routing couldn't clearly be anticipated. such an outcome of the poll, fought between the two behemoths of our country's politics, hardly crossed anyone's mind. in hindsight, the die was cast and the bnp's fate was sealed during its last tenure in power, when an alienated people disgusted with the party's misrule decisively turned their back to bnp-jamaat alliance.
can we find peace with ourselves?
the only good thing about 2008 is that it is over. what remains intriguing is the optimism with which we wish for peace in a new year when there is none within view. we lost peace in the china war of 1962 and have not found it again. since then blood has been shed in conventional war, domestic strife, communal bitterness, secessionist mayhem, maoist insurrection and, worst of all, terrorism.

2008, a steady year for the taka
while the world currency market is still recuperating from the shock of the us subprime crisis, the taka showed impressive stability as it remains broadly steady at 68.50-69.50 per dollar through out the year. though import growth outpaced export, record high home remittance eased the pressure, causing the rate to move within a limited range. the central bank supported the market all year round by managing liquidity time to time. import growth has been 25.63 percent in fiscal 2007-08, against export growth of 15.7 percent. but remittance grew by 32 percent to $7.9 billion, tagging a positive figure to the balance of payments. aid and grants also increased 75 percent.

bangla, not bengali
our colonial rulers used to misspell many names and had left them written in the documents since they had usurped the administrative power in the sub-continent. it is a matter of great pity that we are still using those names unchanged and without protest for almost 250 years. as one of the speakers of bangla, my primary concern is the name of our language. our foremost duty is to revive the name of our loving mother tongue "bangla" and shake off that wrong name "bengali".
brutal israeli aggression
israel has shamelessly, mercilessly and brutally attacked innocent people of gaza killing more than 300 palestinians and wounding more than 600 people. it is israel's brutal campaign to quash the palestinians. israeli military spokesman avi benayahu said some 250 attacks were carried out since the offensive began. israel's air force obliterated symbols of hamas power on the third day of its overwhelming assault on gaza. israel has played the role of a terrorist nation since its birth in 1948. israel has become a great threat to the entire middle east region.
human rights situation
human rights violations, especially violence against and oppression of women and children, are a major concern of our government.
harold pinter: death & etc
the death of nobel laureate harold pinter is a great loss. he raised his voice against all misdeeds. in his early years he didn't join the army as a conscientious objector. he strongly opposed the us invasion in iraq & once he along with arthur miller were forced to quit a dinner party in turkey because he said something for the kurds in his speech which irritated the establishment.
same story!
several years of “grand corruption” by khaleda zia's sons and cronies have resulted in the bnp alliance getting about 10% of her nemesis hasina's awami league. hasina has already commented that hers was the only "democratic" rule even though this is the fourth election; the bnp for its part seems to be saying their supporters were prevented from voting even though 70% of the electorate has cast its vote. so what has changed? nothing. the same players are back - and i bet with a vengeance. antagonism and disgrace has already raised its ugly head even in these early hours and the stench is nasty.
errant umpires
why is it that when australian players appeal for lbw or caught behind, the finger goes up without a second thought and when bangladeshi cricketers appeal, the umpires are unmoved. besides playing poorly, i believe there were several matches which bangladesh lost due to poor umpiring. take for example ashoka de silva. i think he is the worst umpire in cricketing history.
our teachers
teachers are the guardians of the nation. but we are really disappointed to see the role of many teachers, especially at the highest seats of learning. they are not expected to be divided on party lines.
arabs
we asians always believed that the arabs have the most deep-rooted faith in religion, but today we learn and realise that their belief and fear of america and israel is much greater. by dividing their faith and belief, they have lost all their dignity and honour, and division amongst themselves have made them impotent.
relocate the overbridge
last week a senior citizen had been knocked down by a vehicle at uttara sector-4 crossing with jasimuddin avenue, while he was crossing the very busy road. it was pathetic sight to see the old man lying in the middle of the road senseless. there is a foot overbridge located in front of scholastica school, which remains unused mostly as the large majority of students come in cars. i have spent time observing this myself, being a resident. the rationale behind the bridge location defies logic as thousands of ordinary people, old and young, cross the junction mentioned above every day under very risky conditions as traffic comes from five directions there.
denied right to vote
with high expectations, my grandmother decided to exercise her right to vote in an election after seven long years. however, she was (not surprisingly) turned down when she arrived at the venue of bit school in gulshan-1. unfortunately, my grandmother has been unable to walk in the past few years, and when she arrived at the venue she could not climb up the flight of stairs to give her vote. my question is, after so many months of preparation to make our country a democratic state, is this what our country has to offer to senior and disabled citizens? my grandmother, khaleda manzur i khuda, is a registered voter. there were many others at the polling station in wheelchair who could not vote, and i could not help notice an elderly man cry in his wheelchair as he could not vote. the staff were not cooperative as usual. why is it such a problem to make a minor arrangement for senior and disabled citizens so that they can have their right to elect a democratic government?
congratulations!
first of all i thank my fellow bangladeshi people who exercised their democratic rights when voting in the election by standing patiently for long hours in line. we should give thanks and appreciation to our chief election commissioner and his staff and colleagues for completing this election after facing many challenging and difficult situations. also, thank you, the caretaker government. the nation is grateful to the law enforcement agencies for maintaining discipline and a peaceful environment. thanks to all participants who contested this election. without their participation, this election would be meaningless. i congratulate everyone elected as a member of parliament, especially sheikh hasina and her party, the awami league for their landslide victory.
jamuna future park
the under construction jamuna future park is the largest shopping mall in asia or the third largest in the world. that is what we know from the prime time tv advertisement and full page supplements in the most circulated national daily newspapers. the owning company will make this park a monument for bangladesh like petronas twin towers in malaysia, tajmahal in india or even the pyramids in egypt or the great wall of china. the park will have 41 lakh square feet of floor space, a food court of international standard for 3000 people, parking facilities for 5000 cars, banquet hall for 500 people, health club & gymnasium for 2000 people, seven cinema halls in one cineplex, a 45 mw captive power plant for its own power supply and so on.
no anti-islamic law
the awami league in its election manifesto has promised that the party will not make any anti-islamic law. this is a common practice all over the world but the party had to renew it just to counter the propaganda by others against it, calling it an "anti-islamic" organisation.
ctg and ec
i wish to congratulate the caretaker govt. and the election commission for their excellent task of holding a peaceful election.
nosedive for bnp
as expected the boro natokio party (bnp) successfully managed to commit "hara-kiri"; the demise was concocted from criminal misdeeds, carefree corruption, and their "couldn't care less" attitude! even the last ditch desperate attempt of the "netri" to become the modern saviour of islam came a cropper!
revival of the spirit!
it has been an extraordinary feeling of pleasure and pride to see the revival of the true spirit of my country. at the same time it was one of the loneliest nights of my life as i missed the warmth of my countrymen, while watching all the events of election 2008 from thousands of miles away. nevertheless, i certainly could smell the wind of change all around in the most fertile land and minds of the world. the result of the election again reflected the vibrant nature of our motherland where the people have always fought for the truth and justice whenever they were given a chance to do so. people of bangladesh have shown that they are not divided, for years they have been together to bring the dreams of our freedom fighters into light. hats off to the new generation, women and men voters of bangladesh!!!!
learning english
in bangladesh students are required to read english for about twelve years. but the level of proficiency they reach is very low. people taking the civil service examination are also tested on their knowledge of english, but the results are equally disappointing. even those who pass or qualify are hardly able to write freely in acceptable english. obviously, there is something seriously wrong with the teaching and learning of english in bangladesh. most students in this country feel a lack of motivation. there is hardly any subject they know or care to know really well. they are interested not in acquiring knowledge or skill but in passing the exams by memorizing answers. they have the tendency to use short cut to success. most schools and college teachers are ma in english. it is possible to get a degree in english without having reasonable proficiency in the language. untrained teachers cannot teach language effectively.
