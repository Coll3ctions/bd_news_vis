khaleda zia and sheikh hasina on tipaimukh
opposition leader khaleda zia has called on the indian government to scrap its plans on the tipaimukh dam. she thinks it will be a way for delhi to follow through on the reassurances given by prime minister manmohan singh to prime minister sheikh hasina last week. the bnp leader seems to be prejudging the issue, especially when much remains to be seen as to how india and bangladesh handle it. at the other end, there is a fair degree of suspicion that the tipaimukh affair may have been underplayed within the ruling circles, an attitude that cannot have served the government well. when such factors are now juxtaposed with the call by sheikh hasina for national unity to ensure bangladesh's interests vis-à-vis tipaimukh, one is not quite sure what such unity should be based on. there is an element of obscurity that must be removed before any clear conclusions can be drawn from the prime ministerial call.
fire in a closed home
we are shocked at the incident of arson that left two killed, including a minor girl, and five others of the same family critically burnt in their house in city's kadamtali area. though the local police suspect that the fire might have been due to an electric short circuit, the neighbours of the family allege that the husband of one of the victims could have deliberately set the house on fire. the very fact that doors were found locked from outside raised suspicion of malicious intent behind the horrendous incident. in fact, there are allegations that the husband was but a mugger who used to beat up his wife and at one point of time had threatened to burn the family alive. now that fire has already taken two innocent lives, the incident must be thoroughly investigated and perpetrators apprehended.

toxic fruits
our country has long been regarded as a land of fruits. each and every season comes with its colourful fruits such as guava, black berry, wood apple, litchi, watermelon, jackfruits and mango, the king of fruits. in fact, we see that our markets are flooded with different types of mouth-watering fruits in different seasons of the year, particularly in the rainy season. but little we know how fresh and safe are these fruits. we come to know from different sources like newspapers that different toxic materials like formalin are being used so that the fruits do not rot very easily and look very attractive. common people are consuming these unhygienic fruits unknowingly and consequently suffering from various fatal diseases like cancer, and typhoid. it seems that these fruit vendors have lost their humanity for earning money. and they are running their illegal business in front of the law enforcing agencies.

treatment abroad
"health is wealth" is a proverb known to everybody. on the other hand wealth is required to maintain health. this becomes more visible when we see that many prominent persons of the country frequently leave for singapore for treatment in mount elizabeth hospital. a far larger number of people than what comes to the newspaper frequently go to singapore and other countries for treatment.
your heart
medical journal lancet in one of its recent edition carried an encouraging scientific report which stated that human heart has major regenerative powers, how it works need further research. the fact came to limelight when sir magdi yacoub of imperial college london, one of the world's top heart surgeons and his team successfully implanted a donor's heart directly onto a young patient's failing heart in 1995. hannah clark, the patient from cardiff, uk had developed severe heart failure together with lung problems. she was then only 8 months old and the surgeons instead of performing transplanting of both her heart and lung implanted a donor heart from a 5-month old directly onto clark's own heart. as the implanted heart and her own heart were working well after nearly 5 years, the doctors decided not to take out clark's extra heart. but the drug clark had to take to prevent her body from rejecting the donated heart led to cancer that required chemotherapy. but this didn't stop spreading cancer and her body eventually rejected the implanted heart. but miraculously by then clark's heart had fully recovered and the doctors successfully removed her donor heart in 2006. now clark is 16 years old and started living a normal life including playing games, doing a part time job.
student leaders' age
very recently bnp chairperson begum khaleda zia, i am sure after very serious considerations, has appointed the topmost leaders of the student front of her party chhatra dal. about half these newly appointed chhatra dal leaders are in their mid 40s and the remaining are in their late 30s. all of them finished their normal education career long ago in the mid 1990s. thank god, the newspapers have not published their cv. had it been so, people could know how bright they were in their academic life. as students, one may assume, these 'adu bhais' must have been very poor students. most of these student leaders are married and some of them are already fathers. almost all of them are engaged in business. many of them are known to be involved in tenderbazi (forcibly capturing contracts for construction work and for supply of stores), chandabazi (extortion) and bhortibazi (getting students of lower merit admitted into educational institutions).
tourism
the road conditions, hotels, communication, consumer goods etc are dependent on a country's economic condition and any tourist, or those who organise tourism, are well aware of these and make allowance for them. so these factors do not affect tourism to any significant degree, but what does is the 'law and order' situation in a country. a visitor is a welcome guest and should be able to roam with safety, on foot or in a vehicle, (say even a bullock cart or a ferry boat) in any part of the country at any time of night or day, but alas this is not possible in bangladesh. no government can achieve this condition by itself and it requires national effort including that of the opposition to rein in the godfathers (who are well known) of all criminal and rowdy elements, racketeers etc. view the page international
