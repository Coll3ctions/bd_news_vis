tomorrows…
my sojourns on this two-point-one-mile path consist of occasional quick runs, which now have wound down mostly to leisure strolls. the track curls around a lake and is surrounded by lush foliage and tall trees, the blend creates a sense of deep forest. above, the sunrays touch the green canopy creating a composition of light and shade of a variant hue of tender green. this trail and i have shared with others many smiles, greetings; and then again we have also seen many nature-lovers, bird-watchers, fish-catchers, dog-walkers, young and old joggers, critical-thinkers, problem-solvers, of whom few have persisted over the years while others graduated out of their habits! most importantly, i have seen the felling of old trees and planting of new ones along this path. it had provoked serious dissension among the reserved campus community who loved to preserve the old. but today it is a true joy to see the young sprouts standing side by side with the misanthropic woods.

5 fabulous tips to defeat diabetes
diet for diabetes is not much different from a healthy diet recommended for everyone. although diabetics are conscious about sweet products, they are still reluctant about the unhealthy lifestyles that increase the risk. research has found that those who lost at least 5-10% of initial body weight and exercise regularly (best is walking) reduces the risk of diabetes almost 60% in 3 years. let’s have some more tips to defeat this disease:
exercising in the heat
you should not stop exercising during the summer months, just because the mercury has jumped to uncomfortable heights. but you should take precautions to protect yourself against heat-related illness. the american council on exercise offers these guidelines:
ten-year-old girl gets vein grown from her stem cells

bangladesh: new cynosure of the us
in 1971, when bangladesh achieved its independence, the then us secretary of state henry kissinger dubbed bangladesh 'basket case.' but only after four decades the current us secretary of state is considering bangladesh its 'strategic partner.' small actors of global politics are enjoying greater attention in post cold war international system. fareed zakaria presumed rightly in his book 'the post american world' about the 'rise of the rest.' the us is truly feeling the hit of new emerging nations like bangladesh.
standoff in the south china sea
the term "rocky relations" took on new meaning after chinese civilian maritime enforcement ships confronted a philippines navy frigate in a standoff over a disputed shoal in the south china sea. the scarborough shoal is marked by five rocks, the tallest of which projects 3 meters above water at high tide. the surrounding fishing grounds and, more importantly, the legal principles determining ownership and right of exploitation are at issue.
new direction in us-india defence relations
on 6 may 2012, the us defense secretary mr. leon e. panetta addressed at idsa in new delhi. according to him, the defence relationship has done much for ensuring security and stability in the asian region; various aspects of cooperation such as joint exercises and the defence dialogue have resulted in closer co-operation and co-ordination in areas ranging from fighting piracy and terrorism, to increased inter-operability between the two forces which would be crucial during natural disasters. with non-conventional threats becoming more the norm than the exception, the us defense secretary listed out what he described as “new and ever more complex threats” that the two countries were faced with, in particular, cyber security and space security. view the page star books review
the afterthought in the democratic process
quite simply, periodic elections are an integral part of the philosophy and process of liberal pluralist democracy. election is the mechanism by which modern representative democracy operates. yet, at least in bangladesh, it has been treated as a poor cousin of the political ideology, as an afterthought of the process, only to be placed in the spotlight come election time. and, more often than not, that spotlight is riddled with shadows when directed at the electoral process. while politicians of all shades indulge in this dubious exercise, academics in this country have largely tended to ignore it as a subject of serious study. brig. gen. (retd.) sakhawat hussain has noted their relative lack of interest and, although not a pedant by profession, has undertaken to enlighten the readers on the subject matter, relying primarily on his experience as an election commissioner. the outcome of his endeavour is electoral reform in bangladesh 1972-2008. just how much he has enlightened is another matter, and the reader can make up his/her mind on the issue.
tales of war and peace
the us armed forces were fighting in iraq when us marine logan thibault, during his duty finds a picture of a smiling young woman buried in the sand. he knows that he is being superstitious but ever since he has started keeping the photograph in his pocket he seems to get lucky. he is winning series of poker games and even surviving deadly attacks. his best friend victor seems to have an explanation and says that the photo is a “lucky charm”.
the decline of parliament
the prevailing situation is really very funny--- the interest of mps in discharging their parliamentary functions has been declining alarmingly while donors' interest in the strengthening of parliament is still on the rise. many of us do not have any real idea about the ongoing activities by different donor agencies toward strengthening the bangladesh parliament.
