public accounts lacking oversight
there has not been a public accounts oversight body since the expiry of the eighth parliament's tenure on october 27 last year. as a natural consequence, the public accounts committee (pac) of the parliament had then ceased to exist. so, there has been a void in an important area having to do with good governance based on financial discipline.
bonded labour in modern era?
the story of the bangladesh navy rescuing 13 boys from bonded labour in dublarchar has actually brought to the fore glimpse of an organised crime much bigger than we may want to believe. these unfortunate boys, malnourished and in frail health had to work 16 hours a day, often under extreme weather conditions. by all means, it was a fortuitous rescue attempt that ended well but from what appeared in the media report, it is but a tip of the iceberg that demands a full-scale investigation.

a terrible cyclone
there is hardly any country in the world where natural calamities like storm, cyclone, floods, earth-quack etc. do not occur. but bangladesh is such a country which falls victims to such calamities almost every year, even twice a year. a few months back floods hit the northwest areas of this country and, as a result, a lot of people became homeless, shelter-less and had to starve. a few days ago cyclone sidr hit the southwest areas of bangladesh. through different tv channels and daily newspapers it has come to our notice that thousands of people died, a good number of them became homeless because of the cyclone. many of them were admitted to different hospitals for treatment. actually, the exact loss of human lives and properties is yet to be known to us.
trial of war criminals
the present ctg came into power with overwhelming support from all segments of people. some of their activities are being highly appreciated by the common people. it is the perception of the common people that the present government will complete all those works which were not done by the political governments over the last 36 years. for example, separation of the judiciary from the executive was one of the main commitments of all the previous governments, but they did not do that. similarly, justice for the war criminals is one of the long outstanding demands of the people. people believe that justice will never be done by any political government in future. so, like war against corruption, they should take the initiative to bring the war criminals under the purview of law. definitely, it is a gigantic task but the ctg cannot bypass their responsibility in this matter. if they avoid it by saying that their work volume will increase or their main task is holding the election, then their other works that are related to policy matters will be questioned.
destructive campus politics
quality of education at public universities compared to the international educational standard has fallen alarmingly. we are way behind in all fields of education compared to our next-door neighbour india. we do not have enough natural resources to sustain a growing population. our only hope for the future is our bright, innovative and intelligent population resource.
appeal to ctg

a front page news item in an english daily (nov: 10) reported on a heated debate on the sixth (?) draft coal policy at its (6x2) 12th meeting! mathematically, we need (6x3) 18 meetings for the coal policy to be finally approved! the debate agreed that more experts were needed to monitor coal mining (open-cast?) and the environmental issues related to it! it also further recommended the forming of a high-powered committee for deciding on compensation payments and the rehabilitation of
public land grabbed
it's totally unethical that government officers have grabbed public land for their own benefits. bangladesh is a country where the land-man ratio is the lowest in the world. so, every inch of land should be used here ensuring maximum benefit to the general public. recently, a news report was published in a daily that government officers took permanent lease of public land in cox's bazar. we as ordinary citizens demand full investigation into the matter-- whether the land was given following the rules and regulations. if not, then the lease should be cancelled and the officers who worked illegally brought to book.
golf course
since the dhaka club requested 25 acres of land in the suhrawardy udyan for a golf course i have not seen anyone ask the common sense question: "how many acres as a minimum does it take to make a golf course?" i asked the internet and got this answer: "if it's a par 36, nine hole course, you are going to be looking at at least 75 acres. if it's an "executive " par 3 course, you will be looking at at least 40-50 acres, depending on hole length." so the only kind of course that 25 acres would accommodate would be a "pee-wee golf course," a common entertainment in the usa even for people who have never golfed before.
submarine cable sabotage
perpetual sabotage to disrupt marine cable connectivity leaves the country without any communication, resulting in loss of hundreds of millions an hour. apparently, sabotaging the cable is a novel phenomenon and it poses a grave challenge to business and national security. one cannot expect business growth with such things going on. further, it can serve as an impediment against attracting foreign direct investment. in addition to erratic power supply and labour unrest, should disruption of connectivity become a regular incident, then, bangladesh can forget about receiving foreign investment.
beauty pageants
following india in particular, our electronic media has been arranging beauty parade every year. these contests are basically money-making mechanisms that are occasions for exposure of young girls that nourish upon the instincts of sex-hungry souls of the spectators. no coherent criteria are presented for judgment of the brains and beauty of the contestants. young girls express themselves with different postures by walking on the stage putting on fashion clothes for public entertainment. the question and answer episodes are so hypocritical that do not get along with the spirit of these beauty shows. fake events and coating of formality are presented in these contests.
trial of anti-liberation forces
the trial of war criminals has come under spotlight once again. i am quite surprised to see the newspapers coming forward with great enthusiasm. what were they doing in the last 36 years? why did mir showkat ali join the cabinet of khaleda zia's government which was formed with the support of the jamaat? to me, the whole issue has been used as a political weapon. when the caretaker government talks about any radical changes either of judiciary or of legislative, everyone stands up and voices their opposition saying that the purpose of the interim government should only be limited to the holding of a free and fair election. now, it's absolutely ridiculous to see everyone asking the caretaker government to try the war criminals, an issue no previous governments could solve. that's one of the signs of decaying political norm in bangladesh. the corruption issue has taken the centre-stage. we, the common people of bangladesh, want that to be done and dusted first. the whole world has seen how the leading political figures of bangladesh made enormous wealth out of people's misery. the general public no longer care what those politicians say. they have lost their credibility substantially.
gulshan-1 park
i would like to request you to publish a report on the park at gulshan-1 (opposite national shooting complex) inaugurated by mayor sadek hossain khoka in october 2006. every morning hundreds of people come for a walk and face great difficulty due to the broken walkway. there is none for its maintenance and gradually vagabonds are occupying the park by constructing sheds. the quality of construction was quite bad as within one year's time, the newly constructed walkway is falling apart. a few months back, the bulldozer of the city corporation suddenly demolished a portion of the walkway for earth filling and then they left! we don't know why they came and why they left.
coverage of pakistan
when will our media get over the fascination for all things pakistani? can't we realise that pakistan is an unrealistic country whose philosophy is based on hatred. pakistan will never become a country having any significance because of its attitude, system of government and philosophy.
“issue of 1971 war crimes”
the ds editorial on wednesday, november 14, 2007 entitled "issue of 1971 war crimes: time has come to deal with anti-liberation elements" includes "matters were then carried to ludicrous heights by a retired civil servant, an unabashed jamaat follower, when he stated that in 1971 it was a civil war and not a war of liberation which took place in bangladesh."
library
