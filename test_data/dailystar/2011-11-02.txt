destructive capitalism
the wall street agitation that ignited similar movements across europe vindicated my conviction that the destructive machine of capitalism is sure to be burned down by the fire that was so far burning in the hearts of 99% people of the world who were exploited by the 1% corporate giants. writers like rabinadranath tagore, thomas hardy and t.s. elliot much earlier pointed at the destructive consequences of the materialistic industrial revolution, but the general people were hypnotised by the glamour and glitzy lifestyle that the new civilisation brought. once again it is proved that when the powerful are not knowledgeable, they always impose a system of greed and exploitation. so, the new trend is to establish a society marked with justice and faith. people have started to pour into the streets asserting themselves so valiantly that it seems it is only a matter of time before the juggernauts of capitalism are completely washed away by the waves of change for the better.
we can make the earth green again

equity rules out poverty!
a common misconception in poverty debates is that a simple transfer -- of cash or some kind of asset -- is enough to lift a person out of poverty. give him a cow, or a rickshaw, and the job is done right? in the real world, this is very far from the truth. we have to move past this linear thinking, and look at the role of social isolation in the lives of the poorest, whose rights and claims are not even acknowledged by their neighbours or the state.

role of western media in gaddafi's fall
the west-sponsored story about gaddafi has sold very well. obviously, the credit goes to the crafty storytellers, who with their relentless efforts have regaled us with the tale of yet another arab dictator whose whims are as entertaining to readers as to the western leaders. although the task was a bit arduous in the beginning, things became easier for them, that is to say, for the western media, when the arab world got carried away by the so-called "spring," the seemingly never-ending flow of which is yet to ebb. after that, the only thing left for them was to organise the narrative in a way so as to represent gaddafi as a stereotyped villain who having stifled democracy for more than four decades set out on a killing spree.
