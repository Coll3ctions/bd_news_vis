budget with a human face
theoretically, the current budget shows an income-expenditure balance as most of its predecessors had done -- on paper. but when chips came down at the end of the year, the mismatch between calculations and achievements proved to be rather glaring. this truism might hold good even more with the present budget. for, apart from the mega-size of the budget of tk100,000crore, even though partly explained by inflationary erosion of money value, what is really jarring is the sheer extent of the budgetary deficit exceeding well over tk30,000crore. how is the money going to be garnered or the deficit met? the sources of revenue and other receipts have been elaborated alright; but the deficit can possibly only be met by the government borrowing money from the banking sector or external sources.
vulnerability to landslides in khagrachhari
fifty thousand people inhabiting the hilly regions of khagrachhari district are faced with the threat of landslides with the onset of rains. the news, disturbing though it is, is not really surprising. that is because of the enormity of the damage done to the environment already. the destruction of the hills, which in most instances has meant a slicing away at them, has now compounded the problem. added to that is the rampant nature of the felling of trees and a building of homes and office buildings in and around the hills. obviously, the destruction of the hills and the cutting down of the trees have been resorted to by the very people who now are worried about future landslides destroying their homes and lives.
the point, in the end, is politics
there are things that this government, seeing that it is provisional in duration and caretaker in nature, should not be doing. but, of course, there are a whole lot of areas it has in these past sixteen months stepped into, some of them full of landmines. those steps ought not to have been taken in the broad interest of democracy.

papa bongo's big smile
what does a dictator look like? i don't think it's an easy question to answer. more because of the fact that the two dictators many of us have the unhappy memory of encountering in our brief history look so different makes this easy question a much more difficult one to answer. one had an inborn inability to smile, and the other, though keeping a smiling face most of the time, had a foxy cunning look full of deception and dishonesty. so, if anyone is looking for a facial expression of a dictator that might resemble or symbolise gabriel garcia marquez's patriarch in his twilight by looking at our own dictators is bound to be disappointed. view the page sports
