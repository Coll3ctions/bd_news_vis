en masse promotion without posts
that seven hundred promotions are in the offing for the posts of additional secretary, join secretary and deputy secretary in a week is quite extra-ordinary. yet, the government is doing it in style. clearly, it is not aimed to strengthen bureaucracy, rather it will weaken it. this could in effect leave the administration and policymaking more politicised, more partisan.
mob violence given short shrift
when in mid-july 2011 six students from different city schools and colleges were brutally lynched by an angry mob at aminbazar with the police acting as mere bystanders, we were outraged, to say the least. what happened thereafter was equally horrendous. instead of arresting the masterminds behind the violence, the police filed a robbery case against the students who were later proved to have no connection whatsoever with any criminal act. now that an investigation has been initiated into another case accusing unknown villagers, we are rendered speechless to see that the probe has barely made any progress even after extensive media attention coupled with a high court directive. view the page sports

stop bloodshed in syria
it seems that syrian crisis is deepening day by day. the unrest that has gripped syria since march 2011 has claimed more than 5400 lives. meanwhile, un secretary general ban ki-moon has urged the security council to overcome differences over syria and take action to stop a crackdown on dissent. and the latest draft of the resolution strongly condemns violence and human rights abuses by the syrian government. we have learnt from a recent report published in the daily star that the united nations security council (unsc) members us, uk, france, germany, portugal and morocco have drafted a resolution, which russia has vetoed, to impose sanctions or authorise military intervention.
"traffic jam"
i refer to hussain imam's recent open letter to two ministers on the above subject. i am amazed that mr imam still has the myopic conception of blaming rickshaws for dhaka's horrific jams. has he never been stuck in jams on the so-called vip roads which have been rickshaw-free for years? has he never read the opinion of urban experts who blame the soon to-be-extinct empty/half-empty 500,000+ fossil fuel-run gas guzzling monstrosities (ggms) running on narrow, pot-holed roads with a capacity for 200,000 ggms at best, for the jams and air/noise pollution?
ekushey book fair
like other years, ekushey book fair is being held on the premises of bangla academy. this book fair is a great occasion when the readers can browse through the titles of their favourite writers. surely, this fair promotes the habit of reading---a practice which is feared to be on the wane, especially among the younger generation. it is said that the very existence of book is being threatened by the electronic devices like computer and television.
prosecuting the bsf
the recent articles posted in the daily star in relation to the torture of a bangladeshi citizen by the bsf men in the murshiabad district of west bengal have stirred a widespread feeling of helplessness and powerlessness. despite withstanding so much torture and brutality by the bsf men for so many years, it is extremely saddening to see that we are still not vocal enough to take action for ending the bsf killings and tortures. it is incredible to think that at this day and age, with information at our fingertips 24 hours a day, we are still unable to bring an end to such inhuman activities. i urge human rights watch (hrw) to go ahead in its initiative to prosecute bsf (the daily star, front page, feb 1, 2012) and let bsf know that they may fool some of the people for some time, but not all of the people all of the time.

even the dead are not safe!

indo-bangla border incidents
we are quite frequently watching how bangladeshi nationals are being mercilessly tortured or killed along our border with india. thankfully, the media has been reporting these incidents faithfully. i would request our media to carry detailed reports on the border killings in the future with particular emphasis on the problems being faced by the border security people of both india and bangladesh. investigative journalism is required in this case which may address the following issues:
bill gates' contribution to humanity
recent articles and reports published on bill gates in all national dailies will hopefully help the effort to reduce, if not remove, the burden of poverty from the world. it is a noble and profound thought coming from one of the world's richest persons! here is a man, seriously and sincerely trying to lighten some of the misery of the poor that most of us just shrug off and tend to ignore. we all hope and pray that he may live long, and do whatever he can to lighten the load of human misery, help those who have nothing, not even the assurance of the next meal.
sycophancy, bangladesh style
the comments made by the bangladesh minister on the inhuman torture of our citizens by the bsf took the nation by surprise. while the video clip shook the indian media by storm, our minister tried to downplay the gravity of the issue by terming it as an 'ordinary' incident at the border. if the incident was an 'ordinary' one, why the indian authorities deplored the same and suspended the culprits, will the minister please explain? even an influential daily hindu asked for unconditional apology from the indian government.

the beauty of the bamboo
you cannot ignore the bamboo. more to the point, you cannot cast aside the truth that the bamboo has played a vital role at various points in our history. that it has a power of its own, either to intimidate or set the mind thinking was demonstrated a couple of weeks ago when a young lawmaker in rangpur, hundreds of his followers in tow and with sleek, green bamboos in hand, descended on the local medical college for purposes that were as nefarious as they were reprehensible. the bamboo came in handy, even when those under attack fought back and gave the lawmaker and his hangers-on a taste of that self-same bamboo.
the spice is missing
there is one exit poll which no indian election commissioner can ban. it is called word-of-mouth. this word does not come out of the mouth of politicians on the stump, or journalists on the fly. it emerges from those with feet firmly planted on the ground, voters, who have protected their treasured franchise with jealous secrecy till the day of decision, but now that it has been made are happy to discuss it at their familiar community focal points, the teashop, or perhaps over a warm fire on a cold evening that breathes some life into the night.

the inconvenient truth
many years ago, in a desperately poor village in rajasthan, people decided to plant trees on the land adjoining their pond so that its catchment would be protected. but this land belonged to the revenue department and people were fined for trespass. the issue hit national headlines. the stink made the local administration uncomfortable. they then came up with a brilliant game planthey allotted the land to a group of equally poor people. in this way the poor ended up fighting the poor. the local government got away with the deliberate murder of a water body.
