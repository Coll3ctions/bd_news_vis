dealing with unforeseen disasters
some clear lessons have emerged from the building collapse in begunbari the other day. and these lessons centre around the capacity building, or lack of it, that has come to be associated with disaster management in bangladesh. while it is a fact that by now we have somehow learned how to deal with such major natural disasters as floods, cyclones and the like, we are yet to come to terms with measures for handling tragedies of the kind that has befallen begunbari. in the case of natural disasters, there is a response mechanism in place, a truth which has been proved in these past few years. now, given the regular disasters that have been happening in other areas --- collapsed buildings, fires in shanties, even road accidents --- it becomes important that serious thought be given to devising measures of coming to the aid of those affected by unforeseen circumstances. view the page sports

re-designing rickshaw
by now it is apparent that for some years at least, (perhaps decades) a vast majority of dhakabashis and those in other cities, towns and villages in bangladesh will have to keep on using the existing millions of rickshaws to go about their daily vocational pursuits. what is surprising however is that while just about everything around them has changed, rickshaw design is still the same that i first saw more than 7 decades ago. since this is by no means a rocket science, i wonder, why this is so. is it because those who make them, those that drive them and those who use them are all voiceless to be bullied by the 'law' and herded like sheep by the raucous horns of the ever-growing car-owner's fraternity?
bravo, musa

of hoisting flags
as the football world cup nears, football loving fans are becoming engaged greatly in preparing their favourite country's flag to hoist in order to demonstrate their individual staunch support for their favourite teams in the imminent world cup. after every four years, it is like every house is studded with different countries' various colourful flags floating in the vacuum. many fans are planning to make gigantic flags to show their great support towards their favourite team. while many others are making the provisions for electricity supply back up as our quarter digital country is going through a little dearth of electricity supply. whatsoever, the point i want to make is that we exhibit our utmost staunch support by hoisting our favourite teams' flags during the season with a warm, enthusiastic heart, but during our independence day and victory day we do not show ourselves in the same mood.
fundamentals of power supply!

plastic water tank
simple knowledge on light tells us that black colour absorbs all the seven colours of the light spectrum causing heat production and white colour reflects all the colours of light spectrum and keeps the immediate environment cool. that is the reason why people living in a desert ecosystem wears white head to knee garments to keep them cool. for some unknown reason our rooftop water tanks are made of black plastic and during the summer days it picks up all the heat from the sun and amplify the heat several times. this magnified solar heat, especially during hot summer days, would slowly dissolve small amount of plastic into the water contained in these black water tanks. many of us boil this water and use it for drinking. i presume over the years, continuous consumption of water from these rooftop black water tanks is going cause serious harm to our health, particularly the growing children. if we are to use plastic rooftop water tank it is better to use white water tanks which would reflect heat during the hot summer days and much lesser amount of plastic would be released into our water.

mpo list
we welcome the revision of the mpo list. the recently published ssc results and mpo distribution lists have given rise to many questions. being a founder of a technical school and a senior academic, the same questions have arisen in my mind too. the school that has achieved 100% success with grade -a (minimum) was not in the initially circulated list. but the lucky ones in mpo list have lots of students who failed in ssc examinations. even if we make a comparative study or survey in only one district, say faridpur, a clear picture of disparities come out. the studies or survey can be conducted on the following points in addition to previous criterions; (a) recent ssc results (b) profile of founder with vision (c) scope of science and technology education (d) remoteness (e) competence in social reformation and (f) capacity for adaptation of science and technology to create digital bangladesh.
