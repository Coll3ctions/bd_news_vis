nuclear energy: beneficial uses
the word "nuclear" disallows people to not think deeply about its benefits. however, radioactive and stable isotopes are used peacefully throughout the world in many sectors, including agriculture, medicine, industry, and research. isotopes are different types of atoms (nuclides) of the same chemical element, each having a different number of neutrons. in many applications, isotopes have no substitute and in most others, they are more effective and cheaper than alternative techniques or processes. about 50 countries have significant isotope production capacities, and many others have smaller capacities. view the page sports

surrealism: from french to bangla literature
surrealism has been a widely-used and often misused element in art and literature of the modern era. the misuse can solely be attributed to half-literacy of the users about what it is and how to apply it. although the misconception is widespread on a global scale, a single example may confirm the low level of understanding about surrealism among our writers. in 2000, a national institution like bangla academy published an english version of the lekhok ovidhan with a noisy title 'dictionary of writers' (to mean directory of writers) in which the bangla term porabastob [meaning surrealism] was ridiculously translated as 'supernatural' in delineating the rhetorical features in the works of a poet. however, the academy stopped circulation of the book immediately after its publication, this being a 'dictionary of errors'!

opportune time for delhi-dhaka ties
year 2009 is not 1971. if india should not take bangladesh for granted just because it helped the nation attain independence some forty years ago, dhaka also cannot afford to ignore the facts of history and say today that new delhi has done precious little for it. we cannot do away with either history or geography in so far as india and bangladesh are concerned, and, therefore, the best way to move forward is to take pragmatic steps, taking into account the geo-politics and market forces. the question to ask at this juncture is whether the two prime ministers, manmohan singh and sheikh hasina, can manage to remove the trust deficit between the two south asian neighbours and take indo-bangladesh relations to a real high. this question is more than valid because trust deficit between new delhi and dhaka is the main reason for the blow-hot-blow-cold relationship between these two most populous neighbours.

when governance is local government
local government can be termed as the linchpin of good governance for any modern state, specifically to attain political, economic and social welfare of the marginal groups of people within the state. it is vastly acknowledged in today's development paradigms that decentralization can be conducive to achieving the millennium development goals (mdgs) because local governments are presumed to have better information and higher rewards on the basis of which the central government can afford to plan and implement policies, thus responding to local needs and preemptions. it appears that the reasonable gaps between the political community and the civil society propagation of democratic decentralization are getting widened. they need to be bridged through sincere and stringent academic efforts. mohammad rafiqul islam talukdar, a young researcher, has brought forth a work relating to this particular arena in a modest way. in rural local government in bangladesh, talukder has tried to touch upon a number of pertinent issues, such as democratic decentralization, gender mainstreaming in the local government and the regeneration of the upazila system.
the sun god in distant rome
shamsuddin abul kalam died lonely and forlorn in rome on a january day eleven years ago. as this very appreciable compilation of his letters demonstrates amply, there was in him, ever since he left what once was east pakistan and took up residence in the west, a defining degree of nostalgia that often comes to men who think. and kalam was a thinking man, steeped as he was in literature and the making of it. the problem, as he saw it and not without reason, was the big hurdle that was always there when it came to an appreciation of his literary talents back home in bangladesh. and the hurdle was geography. as the war for bangladesh's liberation went on in 1971, kalam was enthused by the prospect of freedom for a country he did not quite plan on going back to. he kept in touch with justice abu sayeed chowdhury and with others he knew were directly involved in the cause. once bangladesh became a de jure state, kalam travelled to the new country, met its important men, including bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman, and came away with the belief that the future appeared bright despite the travails that yet dotted the path.
plumbing the depths of feudalism
mukhtar mai, also known as mukhtaran bibi, was subjected to gang rape in the village of meerwala in pakistan's punjab province on the recommendations of a village council in 2002. it was an incident as horrible in its perpetration as it was powerful in its ramifications. mukhtar bibi, like so many others before her in pakistan and elsewhere, could have opted for the traditional suicide after the shame that was heaped on her even as a whole village watched, tongue-tied, what was being done to her by men on the higher perches of feudalism in her country. no one lifted a finger, no one said a word, there was none to protest the scandalous behaviour of the mastoi tribe. mukhtar was only a gujar, a member of a community that had for ages been poor and therefore resigned to its fate, which again was what people like the mastois made of it.
secrets unfolded, grievances addressed
having just finished reading an enjoyable book on parent-offspring attachments and detachments, coming across another novel dealing with the same subject, but with a very different story, was a welcome coincidence.
