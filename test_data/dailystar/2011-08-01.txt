bangladesh-india relations
when i see al government making friendship with indian counterpart i see a game between a shrewd player and an inept child. we could force india responding to our longstanding demand of proper share of water and resolving boarder and land dispute with our leverage of being in the geo-strategic position. it is not that we are weak as a nation. our success in garment sectors, peace keeping in the troubled regions of the world and in health, agriculture and microfinance is widely recognised. we have proved our worth in other sectors but unfortunately politicians are continuing to fail us and bungling all our plans to build a self-respecting strong bangladesh. who does not want good relation with its neighbours? our prophet muhammad (sm) sent letters to the neighbouring empires, with a view to make peace with them by spreading islam, by not compromising the interest of mulsim ummah and islam. everybody welcomes relationship with india on the basis of justice and equal status and interest. we may be small in area but not in our mentality. this mentality now reverberates among the public. the sooner the government reads public sentiment, the better.

norway massacre
the death of at least 85 people at the utoeya camp and seven others in the government quarter in norway is deeply regrettable. it is the deadliest attack in the country since the world war ii. the suspect is also a norwegian, a right-wing fundamentalist christian. norway is mostly known as a peaceful country all over the world and such kind of atrocity in a peace-loving country is unbelievable. the prime minister said that the murderer turned the country from heaven to hell. stern action should be taken against the responsible person so that no such heinous incident occurs in any country of the world.

hosni mubarak refuses food!

diagnostic centres
these days numerous medical diagnostic centres have sprouted up in the larger cities of bangladesh but it seems that these have no guardians to look after the interest of the naive patients who do not understand the technicalities of numerous tests and which are beyond the budget of the middle class families. then there is the contradiction of wealthy patients going abroad for treatment.

ban on female drivers
banning women from driving is a cultural issue, and not a religious one. there is no evidence from the qur'an and sunnah which justifies this. therefore, ksa must present a logical basis for this cultural practice. a few islamic thinkers (one was interviewed by cnn) hold the opinion that we should not interfere in the affairs of other nations.
