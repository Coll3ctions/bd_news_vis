perspectives
it is always enlightening coming in touch with reality at the grassroots. and that is what i did in jamalpur last month. south asia partnership bangladesh having invited me to hear individuals and ngos in jamalpur district narrate their experience in providing relief to flood affected people, i thought it would be a refreshing opportunity, away from the nation's capital, of coming by perspectives on a natural happening that afflicts this country annually. and, remember, this time round the floods came twice. the first one destroyed lives and crops; and as soon as the waters receded, farmers began to plant new seeds and seedlings as a first step toward recovery. and then came the second flood, the waters simply washing away the seeds and seedlings and leaving behind a large swath of misery.

violent bihar
the security concerns of bihar differ from other states in india. on the one hand, it does not have border-related security issues while, on the other, there is no separatist movement for creating a new state - jharkhand has already separated from bihar. communities in bihar are divided on the basis of caste identities unlike most other states of india. this division of its society on the basis of castes and sub-castes is so strong that political parties contesting elections in the state try to address only those sections that are their committed voters. any attempt at harmonising the castes can lead to an erosion of their vote bank. view the page star books review
they lived and died, in passion and in ideas
simone de beauvoir was certainly not a wreck after jean-paul sartre died in april 1980. but for the next six years, until her own end in 1986, she was a terribly lonely soul. the decade of the 1980s, in more ways than one, was fundamentally the end of an era, one that beauvoir and sartre had both epitomised for years together. they were academics who loved a good, spirited debate between themselves and with their friends. they frequented bars and restaurants, spent time reflecting on the vagaries of life and sat for hours writing and watching the world go by. existentialism, they believed, was all. the mundane, well, it did not appeal to them much.

a charming offering of some of the best from the bard. of course, these tales have been read earlier or conveyed by word of mouth. even so, rereading them promises to be quite an experience. the old ambience of life, a lost tradition, along with a sprinkling of smells and feelings that remain no more, these tales are essentially a journey through nostalgia.
