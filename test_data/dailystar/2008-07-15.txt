bimstec to overcome challenges
although the bay of bengal initiatives for multi-sectoral technical and economic cooperation (bimstec) has been in force for 11 years it has not yet made an impact on the economic fields of member countries. it could not come forward during natural disasters or during the price hike of food experienced by member countries. bimstec, thus, is unknown as a regional body among the people by and large.
proxy attack?
afghan authorities wasted little time in assigning blame. with blood and debris still littering the streets of kabul after a suicide bomb at the indian embassy killed 41 and injured 150 on monday, an afghan defense spokesman promptly pointed an accusatory figure at pakistan. "the sophistication of this attack, and the kind of material that was used and the specific targeting, everything has the hallmark of a particular intelligence agency that has conducted similar attacks inside afghanistan in the past. newsweek's katie paul spoke with paul burton , the director of policy at the senlis council, about how the embassy attack could affect this volatile area.

challenges of the twenty-first century: bangladesh economy
any paper written on the theme “challenges of the twenty-first century: bangladesh economy” would naturally highlight all the challenges----social, political, environmental, scientific and technological etc.---------that could be faced by the growing economy of bangladesh. i have, however, chosen to highlight scientific and technological challenges not without reason. planners, managers and economists of bangladesh usually deal with all aspects of the challenges but the s & t challenges are usually overlooked. this is rather unfortunate in view of the fact the nobel laureate economist robert solow pointed out quite sometime ago that the real engine of economic growth is science & technology. economists should note that it is science & technology that has acted as an instrument of change for all countries. yet when our economists plan our economy, they tend to follow a stereo type methodology using all the economic jargons of the day and all the present day systems of loans and grants from the financial institutions of the world. the ideas of resource generation using science & technology have never been their strong point. it is with this view in mind that i have concentrated on the s&t challenges of the twenty first century which have already brought about economic revolutions in many countries.
