history -- one of america's blind spots
america, today, is obviously divided at home and bitterly resented abroad -- a position the global military hegemony can ill-afford to be in. worse, it confronts a worldwide terrorist movement with an apocalyptic streak, and finds itself in difficult counter-insurgency battles in iraq and afghanistan. even a convincingly re-elected president bush could hardly allay the anxiety and recrimination among the policy elites and a sizeable chunk of general public; neither could he offer the kind of course corrections that the us allies were hoping for.

potato for everyone?
in the face of domestic and worldwide shortage of food production, food prices in bangladesh have risen rapidly and beyond the affordability of the commons. rice price increase is what has affected them the most, since it has posed a high threat to the food security of the people, particularly the poor. wheat has long served as the substitute of rice for the people in bangladesh but in the background of recent price rise of both rice and wheat at the same time, one might be tempted to look for other substitutes for rice, especially for the poor people whose real income is under serious pressure due to the price hike.

global food prices registered an unprecedented 40 per cent increase during 2007. this is fraught with the potential danger of causing large-scale discontent if the situation gets out of hand. hence, it is urgent for all countries facing this situation to take energetic steps with the objective of reigning in the price-hike of food and other essentials. in 2007, rice price in bangladesh rose by 42.6 per cent on average whilst wheat price posted a rise of 55.4 per cent. prices of other essentials rose in tandem soybean oil and milk powder increased by 42.8 per cent and 48.9 per cent respectively in bangladesh.

poverty
apparently, poverty seems to be an almost avoidable problem in bangladesh. at present the poverty rate in bangladesh is 40%. if we all do not store up our riches here on the earth, where moths and rust destroy and robbers break in to steal, then the figure will be changed gradually. the absolute poor are those who cannot even have the minimum nutritional requirement of 2112 kcal for survival. they are the victims of malnutrition & suffer from various diseases. that means an average of 40 people in 100 go hungry everyday. so pathetic!! the needy children have to struggle to manage a little bit of something to eat.
prospects of jute
“the golden fibre” by abed choudhury in point counterpoint page of your march 23 edition drew my attention. like him i do believe that there are new opportunities for jute goods, especially, in recent months, when we are watching the new “green movement” by the west. there is a need for reusable and recyclable grocery bags, shopping bags that are environment friendly and biodegradable. however, i disagree with mr. abed on the argument that the costly genome sequencing of jute is the answer. i believe the answer lies somewhere between the initiative taken by dynamic entrepreneurs and branding, marketing of such products. i will give you one example of my personal experience to put this into context.

defaulters still unpunished
though most tycoons , particularly the so-called industrialists, must be termed as defaulters, there is no denying the fact that no ruling power can punish them, no legislation can put them into prison. paradoxically, manaranjan, an octogenarian of rangpur district who could not pay his tiny amount of loan, was mercilessly dragged by the police not long ago and this became lead news at home and abroad. interestingly enough, such elderly persons are, indeed, an easy prey to any ruling class. the persistent problem of loan default got its inception in the 1980s, during the regime of president hm ershad.
