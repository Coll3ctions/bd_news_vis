bdr carnage and the geo-political equations
the recent carnage inside the bangladesh rifles (bdr) headquarters shocked the whole country. some bdr soldiers (along with some suspected outsiders) carried out a massacre by killing more than 80 people including 72 bdr top brasses (deputed from army). the grisly incident once again proved how badly we manage our national security and how easily one can penetrate through the system. the whole nation mourned and was virtually at a stand still for a few days sensing much trouble in future. however, the situation is easing now. but that left some urgent questions that need to be paid attention to immediately. although the government has formed an inquiry committee vis-à-vis allowing the army to enquire the event by its own, will it consider some very crucial geo-political equations in fixing the event? given the nature of bangladesh's geographical advantages almost splitting its big neighbor, which has an intention of emerging as a global power, bangladesh, for many years, has been capitalized by many quarters indulging many extra-territorial activities. the reason, of course, is its unique geographical location which, in any case, can induce huge trouble to its big and ambitious neighbor. therefore, the conflict of india with other nations can easily be stretched to bangladeshi territory. and any conflict within bangladesh can also easily have a link with the interests of many. the bdr carnage is no exception, rather the sophistication of the execution of the plan reminds us that the incident has a much deeper root.

triumph of democracy in pakistan
with president asif ali zardari bowing down to public anger, the fragile democracy in pakistan has survived; it even promises now to grow despite the turbulence. the victory for the lawyers, judges and former pm nawaz sharif is decisive, but it will take time to settle the ruffled mood of the nation. much depends on the synchronization of efforts by the judiciary, army and the political forces, in an environment of cultivated trust and responsibility. the forces threatening democracy and stability of the country are still spreading. the crisis is not between democracy and non-democracy; it is between the violent elements trying to obliterate pakistan's existence through a civil war and the state institutions and political forces that can hold it together. view the page star books review
tales of the gallows, story of a princess
the assassination of president ziaur rahman remains a mystery, like so many other mysteries before or since, even now. precisely who planned to bump him off or what his enemies planned to do once he was out of the way has never been known. in his years in power, general zia lived a life of danger, in two ways. in the first place, he was a danger to many around him, seeing that each time a coup attempt against him collapsed, he swiftly went into retribution mode. in the second, having survived as many as eighteen known plots to overthrow (and possibly kill) him, he succumbed to the nineteenth in may 1981 in chittagong.
spice, rice and a little vice
whoever said that the word 'classy' cannot be linked to bangladeshi food will now have to eat his own words and apologise. profusely! if you are dead then better come down and see how the word beautifully blends with food that is best savoured when eaten with the hands and not with forks and knives. of course god will allow it! after all, this is indeed cuisine made for divinity. shawkat osman, a businessman and a gourmet, has given us a mouthwatering presentation of dishes and the book not a run of the mill cooking manual is good enough to grace your drawing room. no, it will not make you look shallow but you will show you up as one who is culturally inclined.
