grabbing lakes with impunity
unscrupulous individuals have been grabbing major portions of gulshan-banani and gulshan-baridhara lakes over the last six months with increasing impunity. despite there being clear court orders freezing all such activity and indeed ordering rajuk to go for a demarcation of the lakes, the grabbers have demonstrated not the slightest of fear or compunction in carrying on with their activities. as many as twenty influential individuals, we have been informed, have been filling up large areas of gulshan-baridhara lake. then comes the matter of how and whether dishonest elements in rajuk have colluded with these grabbers in gobbling up public property.
war history in textbooks
we welcome the decision of the expert committee to incorporate history of the epoch-making liberation war of bangladesh without any distortion in the school textbooks. the government had formed the committee on march 31 comprising eminent educationists, historians and litterateurs to remove any distorted account of history from the textbooks of primary and secondary levels. it has recommended incorporating a number of new stories, articles and poems on the war in bangla textbooks of all classes at the secondary level, and also the historic 7 march speech of bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman in the bangla textbook of class viii. the formation of the mujibnagar government, its multifarious activities and the proclamation of independence of bangladesh are also likely to be included in the social science books of the same class.
trivialising the heroes
there is no denying the fact that bangabandhu is the founding father of bangladesh. leaving aside occasional sophistry, it was also he who proclaimed the country's independence on march 26, 1971. a hostile bnp perversely fought a losing battle to disprove the historical truth for decades. a high court ruling on june 22 upheld the truth that it was bangabandhu who had been the proclaimer of our independence. in spite of the irony of its being settled through a court ruling the truth is vindicated at long last, and the victory belongs to what is historical truth.

regulatory reforms to boost growth
last week we along with eight other members of a bangladesh delegation attended a world bank-fias/dfid conference on “smart regulation in south and southeast asia” in hanoi, vietnam. having written in the past about what bangladesh can learn from asia's fdi champ (from $2b in 2000 to more than $30b in 2008), it was inspiring to visit the region's latest economic miracle. the city itself rightly earns its reputation as the “paris of the east” with its colonial legacy of grand boulevards and beautiful french architecture. but the topic itself, regulatory reform, was of particular interest given the apparent loss of momentum in bangladesh regulatory reforms commission's (rrc) activities (two of whose members were part of the delegation) after some success early in its tenure.

polythene bags
this is in reference to a letter appearing in your daily on june 13, 2009. i agree with mr rashid that polythene bags in bangladesh need to be taken out of circulation due to its detrimental environmental effects. they are indestructible, and easily clog the drainage system - whatever little of it exists. the substitutes that he mentions are easily available and are bio-degradable.
save the rivers
the government has been taking steps to free the rivers from grabbers. the eviction drive is highly praiseworthy. but we all have suspicion about the future of the drive. what will be the next step? how can the rivers be maintained? i think the govt should take sustainable plans, for example plantation. this is the rainy season, a suitable time for plantation. government can take up the plantation programme and continue eviction drive simultaneously in the riverbanks. we could get two kinds of benefits from this programme. firstly, tree can prevent erosion and will keep the riverbanks green. secondly, it will be tough to grab the rivers by cutting down trees. furthermore, the authorities can involve all the parliament members and prominent political leaders to plant trees on the banks of rivers and canals. because we know all the grabbers have political backup directly or indirectly. and i hope that no political leader of the ruling or opposition party will allow anybody to remove the trees, which they have planted. we urge the authorities to take the initiative. otherwise the rivers will be grabbed again.
commuters' ordeal
mirpur is one of the most densely populated areas of dhaka city but commuting to mirpur by buses has become an ordeal for most of the commuters because of lack of buses and proper transport facility. although a good number of local buses are plying in and around mirpur everyday, but their condition is very shabby and due to lack of proper maintenance, these buses are also unfit for travel. nevertheless, commuters are risking their lives while travelling by these buses. if a person who lives in mirpur and wishes to go to dhanmondi, then he has no other option but to board a bus of a particular company, a private enterprise, which is the only operator on dhanmondi - mirpur route. this is the only operator who got the route permit from brta (bangladesh road transport authority) to ply in this route and hence the commuters have no other option but to take its service. there is an allegation against the brta officials that they provide route permit for busy areas such as mirpur, dhanmondi etc to a selective number of bus operators whose owners are very influential people since owning a bus company on a busy route means brisk business. from college gate to mohammadpur, the distance is hardly 4 km, but this company is charging tk. 12 for this small distance which is a clear violation of brta fixed bus fare. brta can easily take action against this bus company to stop their monopoly business but they are doing nothing in this regard and we, the commuters, are suffering for this. i would like to urge the authorities concerned to look into the matter.

uttara has become one of the fastest growing areas in dhaka. day by day the area is getting crowded. but the conditions of the roads of uttara are extremely bad. people have elected an mp with much hopes so that people of uttara could at least have good roads to travel. it seems none is in charge here. every single day there are traffic jams near jasimuddin road for hours. most of the roads are also in real bad shapes. i guess, we will keep on living with false dreams and promises.
mobile sets
the proposed budget for the fy 2009-2010 has many new features. for the first time public-private partnership investment plan is going to be incorporated in the adp. but some aspects of the budget are mind-boggling. imposition of flat tax rate on different consumer items is unconvincing. same thing might be used as necessity as well as luxury item. for example, low priced mobile phone sets are used by common people as necessity. whereas the costly ones are the luxury of the affluent people. so the government should differentiate between necessity & luxury. here progressive rate of taxation is relevant. so the mobile sets priced below tk.10,000 shouldn't see higher tax rate proposed in the budget. rather sets priced above tk.10,000 should see progressive rate of taxation. those who argue that under invoicing might be a problem should learn that the prices of different brands of mobile sets are displayed on the websites of the companies concerned. so the common people hope for the finance minister's prudence in this regard.
farmers
there are some people who have vital contribution in our social and national economic development. but, unexpectedly we are always trying to overlook them. for example, the farmers, who are mainly recognized as the soldiers of agriculture. they always play significant role in tackling food crisis by producing crops despite extreme temperature, rain, flood, storm and various natural calamities. but the fact is, they spend their life under the poverty level. we must remember that if the farmers survive, then the whole country will survive. yet, we do not respect these national heroes. we must change our perception, otherwise we may face endless darkness.
daylight saving
bangladesh has started daylight savings! congratulations, though the benefit to be achieved has become controversial already! however, as many have raised concern regarding the possible chaos in light of the change, i believe, the government should have implemented it on the 18th june, thursday midnight instead of 19th june midnight.
ocean water contamination
continued emissions of carbon dioxide from all directions are raising the oceans' acidity to an irreversible level. in the past couple of hundred years the world's oceans have absorbed about a quarter of the carbon dioxide produced by human activities, and the current rate of acidification is much more rapid than at any time during the past years according to the researchers. adding chemicals to the oceans to try to counter acidification was likely to be expensive, only partly effective at local shores and could pose unknown risks.
human trafficking
in bangladesh, estimates on number of women and children trafficked range from 10,000 to 20,000 per year. trafficking occurs across bangladeshi borders to india, pakistan, and middle eastern countries and most are trafficked for prostitution, domestic work, and labour, particularly in textile factories. boys are often trafficked to arab states to become beggars or camel jockeys. in recent years, there has been a significant increase in trafficking. trafficking occurs through kidnapping, promises of better jobs, procuring through marriage, illegal migration, sexually abusing women and girls etc.
digital bangladesh
al is committed to make our dearest motherland 'digital'. being inspired by that commitment the young generation who are students of various institutions all over bangladesh voted to get the advantages of modern technology as a citizen of digital bangladesh. but it is a matter of regret that the price of mobile phone has increased due to imposing 25 percent import tax in recently declared budget. mobile phones which are especially designed to facilitate internet and email using wireless network (e.g. wi-fi) are the inevitable part of digital lifestyle and fashion statement in 21st century.
torturous timing!
the very idea is to complete the working hours of govt. and other offices within the daylight so that electricity is not consumed. normal office hours finish at 5 pm. long before dusk and it makes no difference if the offices are closed at 4 p.m.
driving license
i had been to australia recently. it was necessary to hire a transport for my travelling. one can hire transports from the renting company. the matter of concern is that if the person hiring the transport having age less than 25 years has to pay more rent. my son's age being less than 25 years i wanted to hire the transport in my name. but problem started with my driving license that i took with me. my driving license is written in bengali, which could not be understood by the renting company people and was not accepted. i had no choice but to take the transport hired in my son's name who is bellow 25 years. as a consequence i had to pay australian $200/- more as hire charge. had my driving license been written in english along with bengali i could have saved the money paid in excess. view the page international
