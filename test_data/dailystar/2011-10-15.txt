she is waiting at the station
my mother lives in our paternal home in dhanmondi, which i left in 1997 after staying there for five years, and moved to gulshan. so after these many years spending a night with her just me and her under the same roof, leaving my wife alone in gulshan was only a distant probability, a long shot the bookies would say. but fortuitous circumstances have a curious way of making their appearance at the most unlikely times. this happened the other day when my sister and her family who share separate apartments in the same house were going off on a short trip to sylhet. our mother would be all alone in the old house and her blood pressure was acting up lately so my sister rang me at the office and in a beseeching tone urged me to spend the following two nights with my mother while she and her family were away. well, the wife and i were invited to our beyain's the following night and the evening after we were planning to get ourselves invited to a friend's house an eid reunion of sorts but i thought my sister needed a break and i could rearrange the socialization to spend some quality time with my mom. my mind was made up but i told my sister i would get back to her in an hour. i needed the time to plead with my wife and my beyain. shortly, to my sister's delight, i confirmed all was okay and she could be off then called my mom to tell her that i would be staying two nights only nights as the days would be occupied at the office and the evenings with the wife. so actually all i would be doing was go to her place late in the evening sleep and leave very early in the mornings. but my mom was delighted. i could hear it in her voice. she wanted me to have dinner with her, but i begged off saying i'd be dining with the wife.

bangladesh and india's northeast: a security perspective
the importance of geo-strategic and geo-economic considerations between northeastern states of india and bangladesh has played a significant role in determining the relationship between the two countries. bangladesh shares 1879 km border with the northeastern states (nes) of india- tripura 856 km; meghalaya 443 km, mizoram 318 km, and assam 262 km. internal developments and upsurges on either side of the border have a tendency to spill over into bangladesh and india, especially in the bordering states of west bengal and nes. this geographical location and proximity not only open up opportunities for mutual development, it also creates many stumbling blocks in the bilateral relationship. the porous nature of the border between bangladesh and nes of india has proved to be conducive for drug trafficking, arms smuggling, illegal trade, and migration, which negatively impact on bilateral relations. these security concerns have prevented bilateral relations from realizing their full potentials.

before the opium wars
amitav ghosh's amazing historical novels sea of poppies and river of smoke reclaim the era leading to the opium wars by relating their stories from a non-western perspective: mostly indian but also chinese. the first of these novels was published three years ago and brings together a disparate cast of characters who eventually find themselves on a converted slave ship, but this time the voyage is to take indentured workers from calcutta to mauritius. there are also several felons who are being sent into exile to the same destination, including a raja who has been accused of forgery under rather dubious circumstances and an american mulatto who has quickly risen up the ship's hierarchy because of an earlier voyage which wiped out much of the ibis's senior crew. sea of poppies' mesmerizing narrative is compulsive reading because of ghosh's historic details about raising opium in india (a british monopoly at the center of the east india company's phenomenal success), the hazards of shipping (whether to transport opium, slaves, or indentured servants), a plethora of information about the environs of calcutta in the early part of the nineteenth century and, of course, the lives of people associated with the opium trade. ghosh's incredible array of characters and assure a winning novel in every way.
paradise in the imagination
eighty-three-year old eddie is in the last phase of his life. he has been working on the maintenance of the ruby pier, an amusement park, for as long as he can remember. when he looks for broken boards, loose bolts, worn out steel all of sudden he stops and seems to listen.
a book, but only a textbook
arthashastra parichoy (introduction to economics) is a book in bangla on the basic ideas of economics written by anu muhammad, professor of economics at jahangirnagar university and one of the leading economists as well as a political thinker and activist in the country. it has been published by samhati prokashan. it is important to have bengali language books on various branches of academic knowledge. economics is a complex subject with many mathematical expressions, theories and hard-to-crack terms. but it can be imparted to almost anyone in fairly easily understandable terms and language. this is lacking in our literature. therefore anu muhammad's initiative in writing an introductory book on economics in bangla should be an appreciable step in that direction.
