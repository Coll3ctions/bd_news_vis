significance of hajj
i am writing this letter on the occasion of hajj, the holy pilgrimage offered by muslims all over the world. almighty allah says in holy quran “the first sanctuary appointed for mankind was that at mecca, a blessed place, a guidance to the people wherein are plain memorials (of allah's guidance); the place where abraham (ibrahim) stood to pray; and whosoever enters it is safe. and pilgrimage to the house is duty unto allah for mankind, for him who can find a way thither. as for him who disbelieves (let him know that) allah is independent of (all) creatures”. many muslims are united this day but it is sad that this unity disappears when the rituals of hajj are over. muslim community is going through the toughest of times and we must be united. through your daily i ask all my muslim brothers and sisters to stay united and to save our peaceful religion, islam, as we commemorate the teachings of hajj. eid mubarak to all of you.

eid to the poor

establishing democracy in the middle east
wave of changes started from algeria that jolted most of the parts of middle east and african countries. popular upheaval against tyranny is the great gift of this century. change was inevitable but all the changes were not expected by america and the western countries, although they are very rhetorical about these changes. toppling down of egyptian tyrant was a great blow to israel and usa. unpopular mobarak regime maintained diplomatic relation with israel that was the cause of smouldering discontent in egypt and the arab world. handing over power from tyrant to military regime is a new development in egypt. there are, however, uncertainties about over the transition of power and the covert and overt diplomatic manoeuvres by western countries. a cloud is hovering over the sky of libya so far as the transition of power and the controlling of its oil resources are concerned. because, the battle for libya may turn out to be the battle for grabbing its oil by the usa and its allies. it depends on the new leadership of middle east to fulfill the dream of the people to establish democracy without the interference of usa, israel and europe.
abolish veto power
permanent members of the security council are in fact, the rulers of the world! they are the rulers and it seems that the rest of the world is destined to be ruled by them! they have the veto powers which provide them with immunity from all their wrongdoings and injustices caused to other nations. a permanent member uses its veto to foil any move or proposal that goes against its interest, even if it is supported by all other member countries of the un. while these elite members criticize, accuse and impose sanctions against others on flimsy grounds, they themselves smash any such move against their will or interest with the hammer called veto. due to their intransigence and machinations, many of the world's major problems have been remaining unresolved for decades. the latest instance is the case of palestine. though palestine's just bid for statehood enjoys the support of overwhelming majority of nations, the us is threatening to thwart such a move by using veto in the un security council (unsc).
the essential elements of life
we have become so much dependent on so many things for living that we have become almost oblivious of the essential elements of life, which we get for free and without which we perhaps could not live for a few seconds even. the modern world has got us preoccupied in such a manner that we have almost forgotten about the very essential elements of survival for which we do not have to pay anything. but then there is a saying "nothing comes free." so what does this imply? it is that everything has a price and that which we are getting for free has got a price too.
eviction of poor horijons
it was pathetic to see horijon families at nandigram in bogra are being evicted from their colonies without any prior warnings. these poor and socially oppressed people have been living there for more than forty years and now they have no place to go but to sleep under the bare wintry sky. i find this act very callous on the part of the local government who has committed a grave injustice to these people. evicting these families right in the middle of diwali and kali puja ceremonies is obscene and inhuman. i find it pretty odd that no bangladeshi news media have taken up this issue. the reason could be that these poor people are so marginalized in our society that nobody really cares whether they could make it to the next day or not.
expand the nabisco-farmgate lane
the lane from nabisco (tejgaon) to farmgate is an important lane used by thousands of pedestrians everyday. but it remained uncared for, unnoticed and overlooked by the dhaka city corporation for decades. this is the only lane connecting farmgate. the lane is very narrow and is very difficult for the movement of car. pedestrians, too, find it difficult to use. the two sides of the lane are occupied illegally and in an unauthorized manner by some shopkeepers thereby blocking and narrowing the lane. this creates jam, congestion and kills valuable time and causes unbearable hardships to its users.
relationship with india
prime minister sheikh hasina needs to be judicious and careful about extending cooperation to india on indian terms without resolutely standing for safeguarding the national interests of bangladesh. in this connection, the role of lendup dorje of sikkim, who played a major part in making sikkim a province of india through massive manipulations by india, should be borne in mind.

reading between the mayors
however much the planet earth may revolve on its axis in two days, it was enough time for our contentious politics to go from one extreme to another. one day a female candidate won a bitterly contested mayoral election by a landslide, even after her party had dropped her like a hot potato to endorse a notorious rival. next day came the complete reversal. an assassin's bullet cut short the life of another mayor who was immensely popular amongst his people. in just two days, the power of the people went from invincibility to invisibility. like a drop of water on a lotus leaf, it wobbled.
