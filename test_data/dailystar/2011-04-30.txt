limon's sufferings go on
the administration does not seem to have been moved by the outcry over the limon affair. ever since the sixteen year-old was shot by rab personnel on the dubious charge that he was a criminal, he has had his left leg amputated and has had the further misfortune of seeing the police determined to implicate him in criminal cases. limon's background suggests nothing that can remotely link him to any criminality. the police themselves have found no record of any earlier case against him. recently, the rab chief went public with his view that limon was a victim of circumstances, meaning he was caught in 'crossfire'. that was something of a climb-down for rab, but it was clearly not enough. limon now faces persecution from the police, who have their cases against him ready.

the tunnel that allowed 488 taliban prisoners to crawl 1,000ft to freedom
a huge manhunt was under way yesterday after 488 taliban prisoners broke out of a high-security jail in southern afghanistan, via a 1,000ft tunnel that snaked under checkpoints, razor-wire-tipped walls and a major highway before emerging in a house outside the perimeter. described by the afghan government as a "disaster that should not have happened", the escape has made a mockery of the national security forces barely three months before nato troops are due to hand over control of several parts of the country. inside help is almost certainly to blame. according to a triumphant taliban spokesman, insurgents on the outside spent five months excavating the tunnel before finally breaking into one of the cells late on sunday night, using car-jacks to crack through the final layer of concrete. view the page star books review
perspectives of an insider . . .
days before a mass movement compelled him to relinquish power, general hussein muhammd ershad approached the military establishment for support. he did not ask for such support in so many words, but it was obvious he could look forward to hanging on to authority if his base, the army, agreed to go along with him. it was something of a throwback to the final days of field marshal mohammad ayub khan in pakistan. battered and bruised by ceaseless resistance to his regime in both east and west pakistan, ayub in early 1969 wanted the army to help him declare a second round of martial law as a way of clinging on to power. the army did declare martial law, but not before informing the long serving dictator that a new spate of military rule ruled him out as its symbol. the new ruler was to be general yahya khan.
