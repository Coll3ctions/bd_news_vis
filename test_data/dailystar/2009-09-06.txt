upazila parishads must not be sidelined
let there be no mistaking facts here. the upazila system is in a state of emasculation. where it was thought that upazilas would serve as a strong foundation of the local government structure, it is now clear that the awami league-led government is in little mood to have such a system take root. this of course runs contrary to the pledge the al made in its election manifesto about a strengthening of local government bodies, with upazila parishads being a pivotal factor in such a plan. since taking office, however, and particularly since the upazila elections in january this year, the government has backtracked on its commitment obviously in order to satisfy lawmakers. that has been done through empowering mps to play a supervisory role in the functioning of the upazilas, so much so that upazila chairmen can only have projects implemented if and when they are approved by local lawmakers. that negates the overall concept of devolution the upazilas were supposed to be an embodiment of. what has now happened is a dilution of the authority local bodies should have had under a properly functioning upazila system.
world climate conference
now that the world climate conference-3 has concluded with the decision to create a 'global framework for climate services', we earnestly hope all the countries will work sincerely towards implementing the pledges. the framework aims to help the world community better cope with the challenges of the unpredictable climate behaviour, as drastic changes in the weather pattern and resulting global warming is poised to wreak havoc in many countries, including bangladesh. hence, the bangladesh government needs to keep its attention focused on how and when the recommendations will be translated into action.
what holds us back from joining the global march?
the prime minister has called upon the bangladeshi expatriates of europe to invest at home to accelerate country's economic development. the expatriate community's contribution to the economy cannot be overemphasised, especially for the remittance they send home regularly. reassuringly though, the volume of foreign remittance is gradually on the increase despite the impact of the all-engulfing global recession on the developed economies where our expatriates live and work. considering their unflinching support matched by robust contribution to the national economy under all circumstances, it is hardly surprising that the government would expect more from the bangladeshi diaspora, especially who have also the capital, to come in a still bigger way and invest in the country. the prime minister's call in this connection is therefore only reflective of the nation's rising level of expectation from them.
bangladesh economy and global crisis
the contagion of global meltdown that started in the us has caught up with the others. george soros, in his book the crash of 2008 and what it means, writes: "the size of the problem is even larger than it was in the 1930s. this can be seen from a simple calculation. total credit outstanding was 160 percent of gdp in 1929, and it rose to 260 percent in 1932 due to the accumulation of debt and the decline of gdp. we entered into the crash of 2008 at 365 percent, which is bound to rise to 500 percent or more by the time the full effect is felt. and this calculation does not take into account the pervasive use of derivatives, which was absent in the 1930s but immensely complicates the current situation." he blames the collapse of the "housing bubbles" for the financial crisis. view the page sports

cricket on right track
it is pleasing to see that our bangladesh cricket team is finally playing to its potential. first of all, bcb made a wise decision by stripping ashraful off captaincy. though mortaza was appointed captain, it was shakib al hasan who led the team against the depleted west indies side and zimbabwe because of the former's injury. shakib not only captained the team brilliantly, but also his all round performance must have inspired his fellow teammates. it is the first time in bangladesh cricket history when our batsmen are batting more consistently. tamim, zunaid, ashraful, mushfique, shakib, mahmudullah, naeem islam are playing good knocks. only we should look for consistent batting display from ashraful. many a time he plays unnecessary shots that bring his early downfall. i hope he will be more sensible when he bats.

you are what you study
the newly elected government's manifesto includes the realisation of vision 2021 and the technology to implement it (digital bangladesh), envisages bangladesh as a middle-income technology-savvy country by 2021. although this is a much needed change in paradigm shift, it will require sustained effort and a long-term plan involving strategic investment in education and technology. for this to happen, there has to be unwavering commitment by the present and successive governments to elevate the present levels of higher education and scientific proficiency to contemporary international standards.
back to the drawing board
education in bangladesh is beset with many problems such as divisiveness, high drop-out rates, deteriorating teaching standards, lack of opportunity for higher education, low pay for teachers, dependence on coaching centers, commercialization of educational institutions, politicisation of both students and faculty and so on. some of these problems stem from our system of structuring, some from financial constraints while others are caused by political polarization and administrative inefficiency and neglect. while the ministry of education has undertaken the task of reforming the entire educational system, my focus is on a single problem the structural weaknesses in our education system.
