coordination concerns
no doubt cyclone sidr has been the severest tropical storm in recent times. the damage suffered in terms of human lives and crops is also incalculable, although loss of human lives is comparatively less than on previous occasions. it could have been even less if there were adequate cyclone shelters. however, it seems that lack of coordination is standing in the way of efficient relief efforts. this, we are afraid, may hamper reaching the much needed immediate succor to the worst affected.
commonwealth move against pakistan
pakistan's suspension from membership of the commonwealth yet once again is reflective of the deep concern about the future of its politics in the global community. it was eight years ago, when general pervez musharraf seized power in a coup, that the country's membership in the organisation was suspended and was not lifted until the regime promised to steer pakistan back to democratic rule. the latest action is certainly another blow to musharraf, one that he quite rightly deserves in view of the sweeping backward measures he has been taking to have himself hold office in violation of democratic norms. despite the impression the junta may wish to give of calm under pressure, general musharraf cannot but realise that the commonwealth move is but further humiliation for him.
back to the future
one wonders about the audacity of jamaat-e-islami leaders raising questions about the liberation war and their description of the war as a civil conflict not so long ago. it should not be lost on jamaat that the moment the bangalis refused to be a part of pakistan and the armed forces and the civilians took up arms (as well as those who did not, but rebelled against the central authority) -- the "civilian" character of the conflict dramatically changed.
