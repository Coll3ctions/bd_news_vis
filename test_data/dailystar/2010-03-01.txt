tackling unruly bcl elements
the proof of good governance comes through the difficult and yet necessary actions a political administration takes in the larger interest of citizens. where such decisions are absent, indeed where only a platitudinous mouthing of intent becomes the pattern, it is governance that suffers. in the present instance, we certainly appreciate the candour with which local government and rural development minister syed ashraful islam has spoken of a few bad elements of the chhatra league undermining the image of the government. we also note that the minister, also general secretary of the ruling awami league, has spoken of punishment for these trouble makers. the problem here, however, is that over the past many months a number of leading figures in the government have said precisely what mr. islam has been saying. the constant refrain that these unruly elements of the chhatra league will have to pay for their bad activities has come so often, without any concrete action on the ground, that nowadays people are tempted to respond to such statements with cynicism.

the situation of the public health service and the picture of health centres as a result, as revealed in a recent report in this newspaper reads rather dismal. the situation has been compounded mainly by shortage of almost 20 percent of the authorised manpower. the state of affairs hardly lives up to the government's commitment to take healthcare service nearer to the people and make it accessible to the greater majority of them, more so to those in rural areas.

students
as a developing country bangladesh is beset with many problems. and it is better understood when we flip over the pages of dailies. here being the educated citizens of the country if the young students make the headlines of dailies for their criminal activities, then we can only bemoan our fate. learnt much earlier that a good citizen should have three qualities namely intelligence, self-control and conscience. our students are grazing in the highest field of knowledge without being bestowed with the true faculties of an ideal human being.

democracy
it is said that democracies don't go to war against each other. this is because the democratic governments must consult their people before going to war and people are unlikely to opt for war against another democratic country because consultation always leads to compromise. this is why when france became a democracy after napoleonic war, britain and france -- historical enemies - became friends. the same happened after the second world war when germany became a democracy and a nation based on rule of law.

radio today
at some stage in my school life, freed from routine tasks of schooling, my favourite pastime was to listen to world music on radio conducted by smart fellows in english at noon. and i used to gather the information of latest numbers of top chart of uk and usa from radio and tried to find the cassettes in music markets. there was a rush among friends who could get the latest ones. with the advent of satellite tv arguably provides very useful enlightenment in certain fields of development of mind which radio could not impart with the same efficacy and multiplicity. the significance of radio among common people has been decreasing . a year before or so, listening to the radio became antiquated. but radio today transmitting 89.6 fm has rekindled the seized glory of radio by presenting thrilling music of home and abroad. consequently, being stranded in the monotonous traffic jam or liberated from the worries of work, radio today now gives free rein to one's imaginations. and the way radio jockeys cast themselves gracefully is really entertaining.

my hats off to the report of the parliamentary standing committee of ministry of health & family welfare. the committee has rightly identified the physicians who flouted all norms and regulations with the blessings of the then bma leaders. the report calls for immediate demotion and expulsion of abnormally rewarded physicians. would be delighted to see the immediate execution of the report. similar irregularities also prevail in the govt. medical colleges and hospitals. we urge upon the parliamentary standing committee to probe alleged irregularities in the govt. medical colleges immediately and give exemplary punishment to the offenders, so that this is not repeated in future.
conservation
the principle aim of conservation is to ensure the survival of life in all its forms and variety, and to make certain that natural resources are not used beyond their capacity for renewal but continue for the benefit of future generations. conservation requires an understanding of ecology and the interrelationships of the different plants and animals (including our own species)with each other and with their environment.

ekushey
february 21 is a glorious day to us and is observed as the international mother language day. now the day is not only observed, but also it is celebrated with great significance throughout the world. but to achieve this day, we had to move gradually. in 1948, the then west pakistani rulers declared that urdu would be the state language of pakistan. but the people of east pakistan strongly reacted to the unilateral decision. on 21 february in 1952, many students brought out a procession to get their demand fulfilled. suddenly, police fired on this procession and some valiant students were killed. since then, 21st february is observed as a "shaheed dibas".
terrible traffic
traffic jam is a monstrous problem in dhaka city. i think the problem is more technical than administrative. however, so far we have not seen any methodical approach being taken by the government to proceed in the direction of easing this problem. police are thinking it is their matter and they are continuously issuing orders, guidelines, and rules assuming that it would reduce traffic jam. we do not know if they have any scientific data in support of issuing such orders or guidelines. all seem to be assumptive. view the page international
