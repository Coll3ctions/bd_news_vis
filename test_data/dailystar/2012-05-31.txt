every fraught situation must get worse before it can get any better. but that standard prescription does not appear to be working in syria, where conditions have been getting increasingly worse. the massacre of as many as 108 civilians in the town of houla by the country's security forces is but the latest manifestation of the desperation with which the assad regime means to hang on to power. of course, the regime has denied any role in the houla killings and its apologists have tried shifting the blame on to the opposition arrayed against the president. nothing can, however, disprove the fact that the government has once more killed its own people. with hundreds of syrians already dead at the hands of the army and other security forces in homs and other places, it is hard to believe president bashar al-assad's protestations of innocence. view the page sports
