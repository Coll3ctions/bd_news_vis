no man's land: giving khasland to the poorest
khasland, or state-owned land, is land which the government is entitled to both lease and give away to citizens of the country who do not own land. with an estimated 3.3 million acres of khasland available there is more than enough to go around. however the land itself is not the problem, rather it is the process that distributes this land. how to get khasland into the hands of those who need it the most is an issue devoid of significant attention, but one where a targeted and sustained change in focus could facilitate a trickle-down process of wealth and asset distribution. however, we are getting ahead of ourselves. before examining the potential for the future, one needs to better understand the murky context of the present.

the coming of age . . .
there are times when i feel old. and i feel happy about the feeling that i am old, or getting to be old. a certain sense of tranquillity in the soul, as it were, comes in even as you know that you are no more what you once used to be, that the world will not any more expect you to demonstrate the kind of drive it drove you into showing when you were young, or younger. in youth, it is forever that urge to please yourself with your talents, misplaced as they are or absent as they may be, that takes up a whole tranche of your time. and that is not all. you have that overpowering need to impress your parents or, assuming you are desperately in love with a woman and want her to be known as your wife someday, to let your prospective in-laws know that you are as good as, if not better than, they in scaling the peaks of achievement.
in a dhaka state of mind
