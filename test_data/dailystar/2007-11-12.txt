our energy security
that we need to enhance our power generation level is perhaps stating the obvious, but in bangladesh the obvious needs constant harping upon to make that happen eventually. energy is the engine of growth, but this is the sector that has received the least attention, its neglect reaching the nadir during the last government's regime when not even a single megawatt of electricity was added to our energy grid. interestingly, it appears that somehow more money and efforts had been spent on building transmission and distribution facilities.

pollution record
the november issue of "national geographic" lists the world's thirty worst polluted sites in which hazaribagh, the tannery area in dhaka, is also shown! not an enviable record by any yardstick! heavy metal is identified as the main polluting source at hazaribagh. this is coming from chromium and its associated heavy metal based chemical salts and acids which are the main culprits. much has been said and voiced about it; but as with everything else in bangladesh, it is all talk and no action!
ms. rice, please restrain israel!

save poor farmers

biman hajj flights
biman has arranged a large number of flights to saudi arabia for carrying the pilgrims. if requisite number of pilgrims are available, the purpose will be well served.
registration of political parties
suggestions, counter suggestions and controversies are raging in the public mind and the media whether to allow registration of political parties based on religion. this is a wider question than whether to allow a particular party or parties which opposed the bangladesh independence struggle on the basis of religion, to be registered, because it should be noted that the creation of pakistan and its separation from india was only possible because of the then muslim league which was a political party based exclusively on the religion of islam. the congress party (founded i understand by an englishman!) was, on the other hand, a fully democratic party with followers of all religions being allowed to be its members. this difference in nature of those two parties at that time perhaps is the reason for the sympathy of the last viceroy mountbatten and the british government of the day to the demands and aspirations of the congress, rather than the muslim league.
why election?
i must congratulate the ctg and the army chief for their collective perseverance and commitment to salvage the lost dignity of our beloved nation. since independence, and especially following the brutal august coup in 1975, a small elite, to the detriment of our impoverished majority, has repeatedly looted the country. this political class and their cohorts must never be allowed another opportunity to “build the nation”. so, fixing a date for election was wrong for two reasons:
rajuk and the new law
we all expected during the ongoing emergency power rule that the innumerable irregularities, rules and regulations (anti people) of the past political governments would be amended and made pro-people by the ctg. it is undeniable that the ctg has so far done an excellent job, barring a few exceptions.
news
i read a funny article quoting an indian making a lot of patronising comments about our floods, poverty... and then making a sensational discovery about the rise and rise of dse (india of course is a land without 50% of its children malnourished! shame on indians for using misery propaganda against others to belittle them.) . no article about bangladesh is without its quota of insults!
jamaat's claim
it's very natural for the bangladeshis to get outraged at the jamaat's recent comments.
a mighty instructor
currently, a great many people sound less enthusiastic about letter writing and reading. what makes them show such apathy? it seems that the advantage of current mobile text option and our less cognizance of the importance as well past contribution of letters are responsible for this apathy. if we look 200-250 years back, we find mankind is heavily indebted to letter writers. history says people of the 17th century were more enthusiastic about writing letters. the reason behind this enthusiasm is that very few mediums at that time were as instructive or communicative as letter. samuel richardson's "familiar letters" 91739) is a luminous example which serves as a model for uneducated in its correspondence. another thing needs mentioning that novel, the most popular genre of modern literature, got its origin from the compilation of letters. "pamela" (1741) by samuel richardson is the evidence where we detect a series of letters that serve to instruct pretty girls how to avoid the snares that might be laid down against their virtue. add to all, letter has another connotation in literature as in some cases letters got transformed into poetry, elizabeth barret browning's "sonnet from portuguese," a renowned sonnet-sequence in english literature, is originally nothing but a mere collection of passionate and amorous letters addressed to her sweet-heart robert browning.
appeal to chief adviser
with due respect i beg to state that, my husband the late ruhul amin was a govt. employee and he expired on 08/12/04 in his workplace, dhaka medical college, while on duty.
separation of judiciary
we have heard a brief interview of the law and information adviser on the bbc bengali service regarding establishment of a separate secretariat for the judiciary. the law adviser informed that the government at the moment was not considering the idea of a separate secretariat for the judiciary. the secretarial function would be performed by the ministry of law, and it would act upon the advice of the supreme court ( assumed ). he did not however elaborate on the procedures to be followed to enact and implement such a dual and complex function to be performed by the ministry of law. the functions he briefly mentioned are appointment, transfer, posting, promotion(?) etc, might include financial authority too. ironically, these are tools for administrative power play. on the other hand, the administrative service association has already put up hurdles on the very process of implementation of the decision to separate the judiciary from the executive. apparently, they have points for consideration, and the government is trying to address the issue. view the page international
