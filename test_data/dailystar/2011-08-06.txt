a cornucopia of tagore plays produced this year
producing rabindranath tagore's plays are considered daunting. even deft directors and producers often get intimidated by the bard's works. as a result, dhaka theatre audiences haven't had the opportunity to witness the nobel laureate poet's mastery on the stage as often as they'd like. in recent times, however, several troupes have been producing tagore's plays or bringing adaptation's of the bard's works to the stage. on the occasion of tagore's 150th birth anniversary this year, and with financial assistance from the ministry of cultural affairs, fourteen troupes have produced as many tagore plays.
a unique telling of muktadhara
“muktadhara” (the waterfall), written in 1922, is widely acclaimed as one of tagore's finest dramatic work. the symbolic play has been interpreted as tagore's nationalist critique of colonial exploitation. many believe the play also indicates the bard's admiration for gandhi and his rejection of the machine in favour of humanism. the character of dhananjoy boiragi has been seen as a reference to gandhi's non-violent spirit. many, however, suggest that the play is far more complex, and deals with tagore's interactions with science and the concept of nation.

documentary “shorezamin sriniketan” on channel i
villages are the source that sustains the bengali life. rabindranath tagore took an interest in bringing about changes in the farmers' lives. when overseeing his family estates (located in bangladesh's shilaidah, shahjadpur and patisar), tagore closely observed the lives of farmers, traced their grievances, and studied their success and failure. he formed a cooperative banking system for the farmers. he also educated his son rathindranath tagore on agriculture. tagore's plan for rural development was later shaped as a tentative model that subsequently gave birth to sriniketan [in birbhum, west bengal], not far from shantiniketan. view the page op-ed
disciplining the law enforcers
the daily star editorial of july 29 that impresses upon the imperative of disciplining the law-enforcers causes concern because a supposedly disciplined organisation that is public in nature and maintained at public expense shows cracks and desperation of an unpardonable dimension. events of the last fortnight that included mob lynching of six students, allegedly suspected to be robbers, and torture of a university student in police custody, have prompted conscientious citizens and the media to take a grim view of the serious malfeasance.
kashmir awaits discussion
i have always held that relations between india and pakistan will evolve. it will be a gradual development, steady and sure. this is what has been called a step-by-step approach. pakistan adopted it at one time but gave it up because it wanted all problems to be solved at one go. then india took up the step-by-step stand. thus, both wasted six decades in going back and forth. what was at the back of their minds was that the history of thousands of years could not be wiped out in a jiffy. there was mistrust and prejudice. sometimes this took the shape of hostilities.
mob justice over legal processes
reading the newspapers these days one would imagine that we have regressed into the dark ages. the country has been witnessing a spate of violent incidents involving the common man, who has taken the law into his hands. on the shab-e-barat night, a mob in aminbazar lynched six college students to death on suspicion that they were robbers. on july 27, six suspected robbers were beaten to death by locals ain companyganj after the gang killed a villager during a robbery attempt.
contagion in european financial markets
the fear of contagion is spreading rapidly throughout europe. it all started with greece, the country with beautiful beaches and holiday resorts, a dream destination of many vacationers around the world. the day of reckoning came when the prime minister had to admit to the world that its financial situation is much worse than what is known to the outside world. a candid admission indeed!

flood: some positive effects
flood is overflow of huge amount of water on the normally dry land. the eu flood directive defines flood as 'a temporary covering by water of land not normally covered by water'. in broader sense, flood can be classified in two types as: natural flood and catastrophic flood. natural flood is the flood that is caused naturally by the overflow of huge volume of water from rivers, lakes, oceans, or by heavy rains, etc. on the other hand catastrophic flood is the flood that is caused by some significant and unexpected events, for example dam breaching, cyclones, etc. in bangladesh both types of floods are observed. but heavy rainfall is one of the major causes of floods in bangladesh. when the level of water in rivers or lakes rises due to heavy rainfalls, at some point it spills over the river banks or dams causing flood.
birdwings enriching forest ecosystem
ecosystem itself is the phenomenon of interaction between biotic and abiotic factors in an area. this interaction means both of the factors in an area of the biosphere are equally “interacted” to form and run the system. but apparently plants are the primary phase as producers and successive phases are completed by animals as the consumers. so, plants in the system are treated collectively as the first trophic level and the animals as the successive trophic levels. these animals again provide some backward support to the plants for their multiplication and sustenance to form the final shape of an ecosystem and its functioning. view the page literature
netaji bhawan --- symbol of history
the forum complex on elgin road that was renamed lala lajpat rai sarani remains popularly known by its earlier nomenclature, as gauged by kolkata's taxi drivers. the forum attracts droves of visitors. some head straight for the multi-cinema halls on the top floor. others head for fast-food feasting at the food court. fewer numbers target the culinary destination 'oh calcutta!' masses crowd the multi-floor space and many indulge in retail therapy. some make it to the nearby bookshop 'crossword.' yet few are even aware of the home of netaji subhas chandra bose, the bengali nationalist leader, congress party president and founder of the indian national army during the second world war, that stands at 38/2 elgin road right opposite the forum.
from epicureanism to spirituality
hason raja seems to be a man of contradictions to the extent that he appears to be two different individuals at times. there are many conflicting accounts of his early years as a zamindar. to some of his subjects he had a reputation of a cruel, greedy landlord and a decadent womanizer who was more interested in his hobbies of horse racing and the breeding of birds than the welfare of the people living on his land. to others, he was a generous and beneficent landlord who was compassionate to human beings and animals.

the glass like a shimmering star . . .
the quran is not to be taken lightly. which essentially means that those who read it, or study it, must bring into the act an understanding of faith that will do justice not merely to the religion of islam but also to an interpretation of the holy book. ziauddin sardar argues, with a good deal of persuasiveness, that the quran is in effect a holy work for those who can think, who can doubt and in the end who can observe its relevance to a world far removed from the one in which it first manifested itself. sardar, a leading exponent of islamic thought in the west at this point in time, has little patience with those who in recent years have taken portions of the quran out of context either to add substance to their so-called jihad against those they perceive as infidels or to impose their own fanatical ideas of faith on a community which has consistently seen in islam a framework of some of the most liberal positions relating to man in terms of his links with the almighty.
plunging into melody's waves
namita devidayal addressed her gentle, nurturing brahmin music teacher dhondutai as 'baiji,' whose whisper sounded like, 'you will be my little goddess… my bhairavi,' an early morning raga, the wife of cosmic dance destroyer shiva. she is like the moody mythical goddess, sometimes a pining lover, and a seductress---always the mysterious female force which overpowers evil. this work, devidayal's first, is dedicated to dhondutai kulkarni, whose ancestors were from kolhapur. the music teacher moved to bombay in 1978-79, lived in a small apartment with ayi, her mother, in the neighborhood of kennedy bridge which was only ten minutes away from namita's home in cumballa hills. reading this autobiographical reportage, that it 'was a lifetime of learning---and not just of music,' tracing the legacy of the jaipur gharana, an intellectual school, and one of the pillars of indian classical music, is sheer delight. the cover design by rachana, photo by ishika represents dhondutai 50, five feet tall, 'remarkably youthful… attributed to never having married' protégé of the jaipur gharana, at a concert. kesarbai recalls, '… you were in a white silk nine yard sari with a gold border, and wore your hair in a long plait… walked onto the stage with great confidence… started with a perfect sa… you sang raga bhoop…'
of triumphs and failures
it is very difficult to write about a book as famous as midnight's children since there has been so much written about it in the last three decades. i doubt there is anything left to say and yet i want to add my humble opinion to its overwhelmingly long list of appraisals. i clearly remember the class where professor fakrul alam (at the department of english, dhaka university) mentioned salman rushdie while talking about postcolonial literature and advised us to read him, that is, if we could get him (since he had been banned from many islamic countries after the controversy of the satanic verses). however, contrary to much skepticism i discovered that salman rushdie was easily available in nilkhet (good for us).
