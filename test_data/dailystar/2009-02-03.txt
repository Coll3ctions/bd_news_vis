broadcast parliament activities
it is imperative to make all activities of the parliament transparent to ensure an effective and accountable parliamentary democracy system. broadcasting of those activities would be helpful in informing the people about the business of the parliament because, after electing the members of parliament (mps), the voters have no idea about what is being done by their representatives. view the page sports
