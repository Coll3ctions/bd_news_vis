rumours leading to unmitigated violence
restiveness appears to be fast becoming a social reality in the country nowadays. almost everywhere and in nearly every situation something of the explosive comes into an expression of emotion. the galling part of the story is that all too often it is plain hearsay or simple rumours which set into motion a train of events that finally ends in disaster or even unmitigated tragedy for all of us. we can cite here the case of what happened in gazipur on saturday. acting on a rumour that rajuk was acquiring land for the purposes of constructing a satellite town in the region, hundreds of local people went on a rampage. in the process, they ended up vandalizing as many as 200 vehicles, torching a garments factory and laying siege to a public highway for hours together. the difficulties which such mob action can put citizens into can only be imagined.

euphoria gone in two days

population boom
according to a un study, bangladesh's total population now exceeds 160 million bringing forth one newborn baby in every 11 seconds. the density of population in bangladesh is now four times higher than india and eight times higher than china. according to press briefing by the project director of population science department of dhaka university, the increased population is causing massive pressure on limited resources and reducing the per capita wealth. the country's population is increasing by two million every year with a projection of reaching 220 million by 2021. about 30 percent of the total population of the country is below 15 years, which is very alarming due to the fact that this section of population will gradually enter into the reproductive age. increased population is not only putting pressure on cultivable land but also on other productive and service sectors including housing, education, health and nutritious food. the project director suggested considering the increased population as a ''demographic bonus'' and called for special attention for their education and training to build the section as human resources. special measures should be taken from the highest level for efficient management of the population.
climate change
global climate changes are posing a major challenge to bangladesh, due to accelerated rise in sea level, storm impacts, loss of coastal wetlands & biodiversity. coastal states & low lying islands are especially vulnerable to climate change induced sea level rise, since most of the land area is less than one meter above the sea level. according to some studies, a 45cm sea level rise by 2070 would submerge about 11% & one meter sea level rise will submerge 21% of the coastal lands including nearly 75% of sundarbans mangrove forests. this will fuel wood crisis & immense loss of biodiversity.

referee's faults
an interesting article on the subject was published in a local english daily on 25 june. it reiterated the resistance of fifa to improving the standard of refereeing, and making it more error free. in contrast, the referral system with the third umpire in cricket, has greatly reduced the chances of errors in taking close and marginal decisions. why cannot the same system be introduced in football? fifa needs to wake up from its deep sleep on the matter!
hartal returns
bangladesh is returning to the traditional destructive political culture of hartal with the bnp's june 27 hartal. yes! hartal is a democratic right of opposition political parties against the party in power to warn them up for their activities or policies. but hartal is the most heinous and destructive way of protest. they are convincing people that they are calling hartal for the sake of countrymen. but the reality is completely different. they are calling hartal to achieve their own political goals. actually they cannot harm the government but our country and general people are the ultimate sufferers. it poses a serious threat to our economy. our major political parties promised that they would not call hartal, but just after losing in election they forget their promise. this hypocrisy of our big two political parties pollutes our political environment.
sanctions on iran
the un security council adopted a resolution on june 9, 2010 slapping another round of sanctions on iran for its refusal to surrender its right to develop nuclear fuel for peaceful needs. iran is a signatory of npt that allows it to develop nuclear fuel for peaceful purpose but the west, headed by the usa, has been accusing iran of developing a nuclear bomb. but so far, iran has succeeded in enriching uranium up to only 5% to enable itself to use it for power generation. iran is far away from becoming a nuclear power, as uranium is required to be enriched up to 90% to make a nuclear weapon.

hartal's success
hartal is an undemocratic process of exercising the democratic rights of a political party. perhaps, it can be justified if the reasons of calling a hartal are purely to protest the government's policies adversely affecting the common people, or the government's unwillingness to listen to the opposition. it can however never be justified if the reasons of calling a hartal include testing the power of the adversaries or to energize the party and its workers.

a question

eco-friendly football !
soccer fans around the world were ironing out their jerseys and fishing out the face paint in preparation for the long awaited world cup. these days, the grass isn't the only thing going green on the soccer field. green innovations are sprouting up across the globe, from clean energy soccer balls to county wide greening competitions. there are two large 'green' projects that have been focused on for the event. these projects, along with others, were funded by the global environment fund, who donated us$ 1 million. the first was to green all the lighting in and around the stadiums with solar panels. twelve billboards, along with 60 traffic lights and 78 streetlights switched to solar power.

murdered by mother
i am appalled going through the two news items--- children killed by their mothers. situations in the two cases are different but the common phenomenon remains the same. children were killed by their mothers. in the triple suicide case, the mother not only induced her children to commit suicide, rather supplied them with deadly poison. her monstrous husband and in-laws have committed a heinous crime. but does it allow a mother to annihilate her children? in our society she was not the first woman abandoned by the husband. many such poor mothers reared their children with utmost care and established them in life. view the page international
