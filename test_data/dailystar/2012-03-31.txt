inside pakistan

assessment system in primary education
it is a common tendency among us to identify a child publicly as meritorious or unmeritorious based on the result of an examination. this becomes a nationwide phenomenon after a public examination like "shomaponi," jsc, ssc or hsc. this identification is simply injustice to a child whom we identify as unmeritorious. it even be called a crime (not in the eyes of any existing law but psychologically of course!) in the case of children of primary level, who are still so innocent that when we single out a child as unmeritorious it can make him feel so low and inferior to others that it can lead to permanent damage in his/her self-confidence and negatively impact his/her future. a psychologist can better describe and provide rationale for my remarks. but i want to depict this issue from other hard facts that we totally forget and ignore.

inevitability of nuclear deterrence for the middle east security
the balance of power and collective security have been used as the two important principles for maintaining global peace and security despite debate among scholars with regard to their theoretical underpinnings and operational intricacies. the collective security system may have brought temporary peace in the world immediately after the two world wars. however, it failed to establish long-lasting or ever-lasting global stability and security. for example, the league of nations established after world war i succumbed into failure as the collective peace effort, which pulled the world to get involved into world war ii, the most destructive and devastating event in the annals of history mankind had ever experienced. some writers, thus, consider the twenty years between the two world wars as the intermission or interim period. at the end of world war ii, a second collective step towards peace was taken through the formation of the united nations. unfortunately, the un, over the years, has lost credibility of the peace loving people to the extent that the structuralists started labeling it as the vehicle of exploitation.

tales of the conscious and subconscious
whenever i come across any story of syed manzoorul islam, i recollect the boom-time litterateurs of latin america, namely, gabriel garcia marquez, mario vargas llosa, jorge luis borges and so on. the reason is that the way the story tellers of latin america tell their tales is very similar to the way syed manzoorul islam tells his stories. i find a resemblance between our culture and latin american culture because they have a very rich tradition of story telling like us. since magic realism is an inseparable part of this oral tradition of story writing, islam's tales are packed with magical happenings which we can relate to our everyday realities. his latest volume of short story entitled bela obelar galpo (stories of good times and bad times) is a collection of thirteen stories where readers will find islam at the heights of postmodern experimentation. however, he invariably uses his own experiences to make his stories lively and playful. thereupon, the stories have a direct link with our everyday happiness and grief. islam has introduced multifarious subject matters before his readers through his latest collection. therefore, the tales of this volume are of different tastes. we go through a lot of good and bad times in our lifetime. happiness and grief situate side by side in our life. stories stem from these good as well as bad times. however, we generally do not keep in mind all the moments of life but those which compel us to recollect particular moments. in bela obelar galpo, syed islam has tried to capture those moments in the light of his experiences.
thoughts of a liberated man
reviews and ripostes is basically a collection of newspaper columns by the writer published in the period 1996 -2005. the author says in the foreword: “the essayist is a self liberated man, sustained by the childish belief that everything he thinks about everything that happens to him is of general interest. he is a fellow who thoroughly enjoys his work, just as people who take bird walks enjoy themselves.” the essays in this book contain the writer's perception of various national as well as international affairs and issues during the last decade, which was eventful. they span a vast domain of subjects like the historic water sharing treaty, the decisive role of education, political rhetoric: use and abuse, bangabandhu jamuna bridge, strategies for redesigning government, etc. it is a vast canvas. mahbub husain khan wields a facile and multicolored pen which flows like the rivers of bangladesh. his style is simple, lucid and attractive. it pulls readers toward the many themes he articulates in this collection. his concern for contemporary issues and their analysis are in a sense very original.
on the streets of cairo
of the many novels with settings in cairo, albert cossery's the colors of infamy captures the frenzy of the metropolis more vividly than all the others i have read. cossery's novella was published in french is 1999, more than a decade before the recent events that have altered egypt so thoroughly, though all the seeds of the current revolution are present: the decrepit sections of the city; the traffic on the streets, making them impossible for pedestrians to cross; the minions of street-people with little hope or expectations in their lives. the narratora professional thiefis stopped short in his tracks one day when he discovers a new occupation: street crosser.
