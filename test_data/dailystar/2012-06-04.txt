pedestrians must follow traffic rules
i have regularly seen at gulshan first circle that pedestrians cross the road defying traffic signal! is this deliberate, or are all pedestrians illiterate? they deliberately walk across the stream of moving vehicles when the traffic light is not green! this results in the moving vehicles being forced to stop in the middle of the crossroad, causing unnecessary traffic foul-up. this is the result of the people deliberately violating traffic rules on busy crossings at their whim, illegally exercising their 'right of way' and disregarding traffic laws!
brutal attack on photojournalists
journalists play a pivotal role in building the conscience of the nation. all over the world they are treated with respect but bangladesh is an exception in this regard. in our country journalists usually face much obstruction in their professional life and they often experience oppressive treatment by the government.
shops eating up pavement!
this photo was taken in the last week of may 2012 which shows how the shops at gulshan-2 area are grabbing the pavements and as a result the pedestrians are forced to walk on the main road choking the room for the vehicles which contributes to traffic jam. i wonder how this is happening at the vip zone of the capital city where all the foreign missions have their offices. who should we blame -- the police or the city corporation? don't the chancery head of police as well as the city corporation of this part see this nuisance that is jeopardising our image at the hub of chancery? is it very hard to seize all the stuff of these shops and give them exemplary punishment like huge monetary penalty or seven days' rigorous imprisonment? what is needed is a firm decision and its quick implementation. and that may give the pedestrians their pavement back and help ease traffic congestion.

on this environment day
5th june is going to be observed as the world environment day. many organisations and clubs will probably bring out processions and arrange different programmes to observe this day but how about we take some personal initiatives this year? let's plant a tree from each household and take care of it for the next one year. we don't have to choose 5th june as our only day to be environment conscious persons, we can plant trees anytime during this month or this monsoon for that matter. these small actions at individual level will hopefully return huge revenues in the future.
friend or foe?
police are known to be friends of people. people do have respect for their work. but it is a matter of great regret that quite often the members of police are found to abuse people. of late, three photojournalists of a national daily were severely beaten up by some members of police without any apparent reason. such occurrences are not isolated. very often we go through this kind of situation. the major task of the police force is to implement the executive orders of the government properly, not to misuse the power given to them. however, it should also be a major concern of the government to provide more facilities and better environment for the police so that they get the inspiration to work for people's good. but the guilty policemen should not be shown any favour. we want their severe punishment.
