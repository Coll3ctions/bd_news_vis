the absence of ministers in the jatiya sangsad (js) session drew flak from senior lawmakers at a js sitting on thursday. we couldn't agree more with those lawmakers for their being vocal on the issue. the ministers, if only for their portfolios, should be particularly attentive to their constitutional responsibility in attending js sessions. as some senior lawmakers pointed out, they are rather more interested in attending to other businesses than keeping their presence in the js.

the last sarail ?
my first sight of a sarail hound takes my breath away. i am expecting just another dog, but what faces me is much more: a dog with healthy bits of cheetah and tiger rolled into it. its sleek and powerful body, unusually thin hips, tiger-striped brindle, large chest, and taut white-tipped tail all radiate energy and remind me uncomfortably of a missile ready to launch. when i raise my camera, i do so very cautiously.

setting qualifications for members of parliament
right-thinking citizens would perhaps agree that parliaments are solemn constitutional entities that are charged with onerous responsibilities of framing the law. in addition, parliament invariably exercises control over public finance. thus the parliament, although a creature of the constitution, appears to be supreme. whether or not in bangladesh we have parliamentary supremacy may perhaps be debated. however, an issue that engages thinking minds is the aspect of qualifications of the members of the august institution of parliament.
at the end of tether
in the midst of l.k. advani's rath yatra to polarise the country and the telangana agitation to articulate local chauvinism, india is oblivious to the 'occupy wall street' movement against capitalism which has given shape to what the west is today.
fighting inflation
the people of bangladesh for the last 7 years have been inflicted by rising inflation. it is a major concern for a country like us where a large number of people hover around the poverty line. the government of bangladesh is trying its best to address this issue. however, its contractionary monetary policy and expansionary fiscal policy have complicated the situation and made the possibility of getting out of it an elusive one.
food security for bangladesh
the alarm bell sounded by analysts in the asian region to boost up agriculture in a bid to ensure food security during a summit convened by cpd in dhaka must be taken as a wake up call for bangladesh. the euphoria over the present food stock in the country may be short-lived unless the entire administration understands the enormity of the task or makes introspection as to why the country remained bogged down in abysmal poverty accentuated by production shortfall in agriculture over the years.

pollution poses serious threat to city dwellers
dhaka is one of the worst polluted cities in the world. the air we breathe is mixed with smokes from thousands of vehicles moving on its roads. the amount of smoke emission could have been much lower if traffic jam could be eliminated. and no doubt the level of noise is much higher than the tolerable limit. then not only smoke from cars is polluting the air, methane, the natural gas being continuously discharged from thousands of kitchens is also adding to the city pollution.
economic fixes should not worsen environmental crisis
rescue responses that followed the financial crisis first surfacing in the northern hemisphere around 2006 before burgeoning into global crisis in 2008 were speedy, intense and even overwhelming. but the recovery is questionable because standard measures of economic performance fail to recognise accompanying environmental damages. both the financial crisis and the environmental crisis have common drivers, many in the making over the past several decades. view the page literature

though preventable, stroke strikes 1 in 6
stroke, a condition when blood supply to brain is disrupted or severely reduced, kills more people than those attributed to aids, tuberculosis and malaria put together. every six seconds, someone somewhere will die of stroke. one in six people will have a stroke at sometime in their lives. but a very few people actually know how to prevent or recognise stroke at early stage and seek treatment in time.
toxic effects of vitamin supplements
many people believe that taking vitamin supplements daily will keep them healthy and provide them with strength. many believe the more the better. often, some people ask doctors to prescribe vitamin in addition to other medicine for weakness and to become fit. but evidence shows taking extra doses of vitamins can do more harm than good. experts opined that vitamins are only needed when there is clear indication of deficiencies.
prevent hypertension, prevent stroke
high blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is the single most important risk factor for stroke. some 50 percent of strokes can be attributed to high blood pressure. the risk of stroke increases directly in proportion to blood pressure. despite having this significant risk factor, many people become unaware of it as it is silent and the damage caused by hypertension happens over time. however, hypertension can be easily detected and is usually controllable with lifestyle measures (diet, physical activity and maintenance of a healthy weight) and medication.
beware of added sugar
too much sugar in the diet can contribute to tooth decay and unwanted pounds packed around your middle. many foods have naturally occurring sugar, which is generally sufficient to ensure that your body has enough fuel. consuming too much added sugar is what you should be concerned about, the american academy of family physicians says.
green vegetables improve immune defenses

a regional cold war?
somebody in iran will have to pay the price," saudi prince turki al-faisal's phonation in response to alleged plot by iranian officials to assassinate the saudi ambassador in washington is symptomatic to a growing regional cold war in middle east. this cold war takes shape in a regional scale between two countries with asymmetric power in comparison to other arab countries. the question of leadership which falls within the 'zero-sum' equilibrium in middle east lies into the gravity of the tension.
withdrawal of us troops from iraq: a misguided war
on 21st october, president barack obama declared the last us troops would leave iraq by the end of the year, signalling the official close to one of the longest, most politically contentious wars in his country's history and its attempt to democratise the middle east with military might. declaring the "tide of war is receding", obama and other administration officials sought to portray the move as an honourable completion of a long and difficult mission, and part of a broader shift away from direct us military involvement not just in iraq, but in afghanistan and libya as well. barack obama promised the remaining 40,000 us troops would be "home for the holidays", fulfilling a campaign pledge but also acceding to the reality of a depleted treasury and overwhelming us public opinion. it also reflected the political fact that iraq demanded an end to the us presence. view the page star books review
the wilderness of devalued values
“...the sanctity of the dhaka university campus was inviolable in the fifties. no police, no political leader would dare violate its sanctity. what do we find today?” asks mohammad ameeruz zaman in his compilation of mainly newspaper articles written by him mostly in the 1990s, in quest of fairness. he was at once lamenting the end of the innocence of idealism in student politics in the 1950s, and lambasting the degradation of what passed for (and even more emphatically passes for in the new millennium) student politics in the mid-1990s. it is also a sampling of the general tenor of the book, written by a one time high bureaucrat of pakistan who also had a protracted stint in working for the united nations. nostalgia for the days of his formative years in the 1950s and the values and political idealism of the 50s and 60s seep through his writings again and again, as well as his despondency over what he views as alarming degradation of mores and traditions, which could lead one to mistake the author for a curmudgeon and an armchair idealist and fatalist. that assessment would be a mistake, though, since, even allowing for the expected changes in perspectives and ethos in a new generation, there have been unmistakable changes for the worse in certain core value areas from the 50s and 60s to the 90s and beyond, as zaman brings up on a number of occasions.
the life and times of a writer
when a new fiction by hasan azizul haque hits the market, it equally shakes up the literary scene in both parts of bengal. a very few living writers, especially the breed devoted to literature and certainly not to churning out literary compositions that may sell well in the next book fair, have enjoyed such a feat. but when a collection of the same author's interviews comes out, the impact is yet to be weighed. however, given the enormous influence of his fiction and non-fiction that have over the past five decades formed a considerable body of canonical literature without ever sounding authoritative yet always encouraging later generations, it can fairly be assumed that his interviews will hold as much interest for the readers precisely because in them, as is indicated in the title, is revealed not only the workings of a great, creative mind; but also the variegated, multifarious experiences of a man's life, which are no less colourful than his stories. as overstated as the statement about haque's canonical status may sound, its veracity is upheld by the interviewers themselves, some of whom have already secured a place in bengali fiction such as qayes ahmed and shahaduzzaman while others are promising writers; and a number of whose queries so vividly bring to light the enigmatic power of his language coupled with his unflagging commitment to a cause that has held sway over them. it is interesting to note that much like his life as well as his fiction that is set across the borders, the interviewers too come from both parts of bengal.
in the circle of fire
ahmed sofa, one of the most distinct of intellectual voices in post-liberation bangladesh, wrote several novels that have made a stir in the traditional intellectual environment of bangladesh. he was the seer of his time. his writings widen the minds of his readers. his alat-chakra (the circle of fire) is such a novel it is not long but it holds the purana of war and love on its palm. this purana is composed against the backdrop of the liberation war of bangladesh. through depicting the lives of the refugees of bangladesh in kolkata, india, during 1971, it has portrayed the relationship between india and bangladesh of that period and the mentality of the people of these two countries towards one another. the novel is in the first person narrative, told by daniel, a personification of the author himself. it was first published in the eid issue of nipun, a bengali weekly, in 1985. then a new version was published in 1993.
