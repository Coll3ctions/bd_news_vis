getting old vehicles off the streets
the authorities plan to launch a drive against old vehicles and fake driving licences in the city from july 15. we certainly commend the move, though we cannot stay away from reminding the government that similar moves were earlier announced as well, with much fanfare, before things went back to square one. let matters be a little different this time and in a way that takes certain important factors into consideration. clearly the biggest factor here relates to citizens' comfort while commuting or trying to commute. the government's plans to crack down on 20-year-old buses and 25-year-old trucks, from such a point of view, should be looked at carefully. much as we would like to see ageing vehicles taken off the streets, we also feel that nothing should be done that will leave commuters without transport all of a sudden. one can well imagine the chaos that will ensue if on july 15 and on the days following, citizens wake up to a nightmare of having to fend for themselves without transport.
alleviating beggary is a pressing task
street beggary, particularly at the city's traffic intersections, has acquired an ungainly ubiquity. it's hazardous for those who practise it along assorted transports pulling up at a signal point and then rushing out when given green light. children and women are among the most vulnerable. it is also visibly self-degrading as a crippled hand or leg or a blind eye is called attention to by tapping on the window panes, or if these panes are open show it to appeal to the sense of piety of the vehicle passengers. some of them look the other way, some handing in a small amount. view the page sports

the hype and the reality
the extra enthusiasm witnessed before and after the recent mayoral election of the so-called commercial capital of bangladesh does not come as a surprise for those that are aware of our political culture. what perhaps had struck many is that an intensely political personality has been humbled at the hustings by a not-so-politically committed person. that may or may not be a significant development in our situation particularly the electoral politics but the reality is that despite disclaimers from the two main political parties mayoral election has in effect, been contested on a political party basis.

discipline in public universities

'come home,' you once said . . .
today let me reminisce with you on a day simple in content, yet pleasure filled. i was forewarned of the cardinal rule of load-shedding. for someone who rarely gets to appreciate star-brights in the galaxy because of the disunity caused by contrived lights, this is a welcome change. i asked for a much forgotten hurrican, the oil lamp. i can see that the chimney has been untried for quite sometime and in spite of rubbing it with ashes it did not regain its original lustre. the light does not come through very clearly. this does not bother me. i am toying with my thoughts while staring at the dancing flame; it has a hypnotic effect. it dulls what exists around me, limits my peripheral vision and allows me to focus, to be with myself. and yes, i like the pale gold ambience. i wish you were here! it is quite enchanting.

crisis in thailand: probing historical roots
the current political crisis in thailand brings forth several assumptions regarding its emergence. the tumultuous historical background suggests numerous factors playing a role in the present breakdown in thailand. by shedding light on the historical patterns of political evolution in thailand, one can possibly help resolve the current conundrum of governance for the present and the future. this article will explain the tumultuous situation in thailand in the context of three significant questions. what parts of the society comprise the 'red shirts' and the 'yellow shirts,' and what are the root causes for such a violent uprising in thailand? are there any major economic underpinnings in the political condition since the asian financial crisis of 1997? what are the reasons for the escalation of the protests and how far will it undermine the process of democratization in the region? view the page star books review
faith, tradition and the world of islam's women
mohammad ali syed subtitles his work as 'a progressive view', which certainly points to the kind of case he makes for his interpretation of islamic rules and conventions as they apply to women. syed has little patience with the proponents of radical islam, those whose view of the faith embraces some of the most conservative, indeed fanatic assessments of the position muslim women should hold in society. the increasing alarm that in recent times has been raised over such issues as the use of the niqab and hijab by muslim women does not, for the writer, emphasise the core of the islamic faith and indeed goes against history. not for him the bigotry which has long characterised (and still does characterise) the status of women in islam. not for him, therefore, an acquiescence in the thought that women in islam belong in one place, in this instance the four walls of a male-dominated home.
a doomed love, in new language
if shakespeare's tragedy romeo and juliet is a manifest love story of two young lovers, antony and cleopatra is a mature version of love between two mature lovers. “age can not wither her, nor custom / stale her infinite variety. other women cloy/ the appetites they feed, but she makes hungry/ where most she satisfies. for vilest things / become themselves in her, that the holy priests/ bless her when she is riggish” (2.3.240-45). the above words uttered by enobarbus aptly tell us about the entirety of the magic character physical and psychological demeanourof cleopatra, the queen of egypt. who could evade the terminal spell cast by cleopatra? ah, none! the three great roman heroes: pompey the great, julius caesar and mark antony did succumb to the all encompassing and pulling power of the mysterious queen! mark antony, at a critical state of making a choice between his martial duties and his love for cleopatra, falls in an all-lost, happily of course, love with cleopatra. their love triumphs over all other mundane affairs. at the time of their impending doom, however, antony tries to kill himself and an unyielding cleopatra commits suicide kills herself using a venomous asp's poison. she remains triumphant to herself and their love: “antony shall be brought drunken forth, and i shall see/ some squeaking cleopatra boy my greatness / i'th' posture of a whore” (5.2.214-17).
looking for love in foreign land
there may be few books that can hold up the tapestry of human bondage so intricately as the vine of desire. desire and loneliness, love and faithfulness interplay through the tale of three indian immigrants caught in the dilemma of living under the same roof in america. the story is totally engrossing and leaves the reader breathless with the minute details caught in the emotional upheavals of life. shudha, a young indian woman, comes to visit her cousin anju in new york. shudha is newly divorced and still under the mental agony such family breakups can cause. she left her husband when her he and her mother-n-law wanted her to have an abortion because the baby she was carrying was a female foetus. to escape from them shudha goes back to her parents. now she is the mother of the baby girl, dayita, who is with her in the us. shudha and anju have been very close friends ever since they were little girls. anju had a miscarriage and is very upset and so shudha has agreed to come to help her out with the trauma.
