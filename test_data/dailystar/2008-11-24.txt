ec's sticking to rpo restrictions welcome
in the sequel to the election commission rescheduling the national and upazila poll dates thereby meeting the political parties' principal demand, we are heartened by the ec's announcement that it would stick to the restrictions contained in the amended rpo. the ec's decision not to further relax the provisions of rpo is well in order; for, we think, it needs the power to conduct the election effectively and credibly.
clash between students and shopkeepers
we are appalled at the report of dhaka college students and local shopkeepers getting involved in a brawl on petty matters that left fifteen people injured. the two-hour long brick-batting and vandalism that ensued caused damage to a number of shops in a local market place and a building of the college. it is not really clear why a minor altercation over the purchase of a shoe-rack ended up with the two sides going on a war path. clearly both sides ran out of patience and sense of propriety taking recourse to violence. it is extremely regrettable that their mindless acts caused three-hour long traffic congestion on mirpur road that ultimately spilled all over dhanmondi residential area.

daniel vettori will look for a magic cure to new zealand's traditional batting woes before friday's second test as they attempt the difficult task of levelling the series in adelaide. one of the many worries for vettori when he took over the leadership from stephen fleming in 2007 was the side's lack of run-scoring ability and it was on display again in brisbane as they were dismissed for 156 and 177 on the way to a 149-run defeat.

power and responsibility
either they do not understand or they do not want to understand that this is not only the chair of power but this also bears the responsibilities of entire populace. i am talking about our so-called politicians. these politicians like to promise thousands of times to commoners on different issues and among them most common and used words are... “people are the source of all power (whatever they cherish in their minds)” and we keep hearing if they get “power” they will do this or that for the people and so on.
traffic issue
the problem persists. and people continue to suffer. we don't know how long this will continue.
polythene menace
it is no more unknown to people how much disastrous the polythene bags are for our environment. the intriguing matter is that polythene bag is banned in our country. the present caretaker govt, since it took over, has brought many changes or at least tried to do so either by enacting laws or by amending provisions in the existing laws. but it is a matter of regret that they have given a complete blind eye to the violation of an existing law. when the whole world is getting interested in using environment friendly things in everyday life, our country is producing environment destroying polythene. people of our country have a natural tendency to violate laws. so the govt should ensure the enforcement of the laws. we expect our govt will take necessary measures immediately to stop polythene production and sale.
the world and we
with all the hoopla of the us election slowly dying down, it is time for the new president elect to assemble his team and get down to the business of restoring the world economy as well as the american status quo in the world. come jan 20, president obama will take up the mantle of not only the most powerful country in the world but the country whose policies will directly or indirectly affect the rest of the world. with the promise of pragmatism and deliberate legislation to boost up the world's economy, president elect obama provides a golden opportunity for countries like bangladesh to finally emerge from the shadows of corruption and calamity and play an important part in the next “bubble”, whatever that may be.
think about it
almighty god - our lord promised, among other things, in holy quran: he will protect the holy quran. the event that reportedly took place recently in hyderabad, india, bears inter alia testimony to the fact: how almighty god has - once again - set a clear example with regard to fulfilment of his above promise before all his creatures, enabling them to witness it or to know about it or to internalise it otherwise, to take lesson from it, and to use it in pursuits of say, strengthening their trust in him, to mention a few. a description of the event given by one, mr. naseer ahmad mughal via a google website posting has been presented below:
a sad incident
a news item that was published in your daily on november 17,2008 with the headline "harassed, girl takes her life" caught my attention. i was sad and yet angry with the people for whom an innocent girl had to give her precious life. this is not a new story. it is happening in our society often but how long will we keep on seeing these barbaric attitudes of these characterless people? as long as we do not have effective laws in our society these incidents will keep on happening. the girl was an ssc examinee who took her own life when some boys repeatedly teased her.

party nomination
the political parties are now busy selecting the candidates for the upcoming parliamentary & upazila election. the past experience regarding the nomination for election is not encouraging, rather frustrating. the people of the land have observed and experienced undesirable and quite undemocratic things in the process of nomination. bribery, selling of nomination widely known as “nomination trade” was much talked about before the scheduled 22nd january 2007 election.
tragic indeed
on 17th november on the last page of the daily star a headline drew my attention. . but after reading the heading i became extremely emotional and disappointed and suddenly i said to myself oh! no!! not again!! after reading the entire news i came to know that a young girl of gopalganj district named lima had taken her life after continuous harassment & teasing of local goons.

noting to predict now, just wait for the result. the british high commissioner has no headache if the election is held under the state of emergency.

"islamic" militants
i am writing this letter in reference to the recent report titled “ huge explosive haul after jmb men held” on monday nov 17 where the jmb members were referred to as “islamic militants”. i always wonder from where the word “islamic militants” came and what is really meant by “islamic militants” or “islamic terrorists” . where in our religion it is mentioned how to be an “islamic militant or how to be an “islamic terrorist”? what is the “islamic way” to kill people or do harm to others? living abroad when i open newspapers or listen to the media i feel bad to hear the word “islamic terrorist” but at the same time i feel that these people do not know much about this great religion so it is easy for them to label the terrorists as the way they are doing now. once i had to speak to my child's schoolteacher regarding a handout given at school on 9/11 observance day where a picture showed an airplane being attacked by “islamic terrorists”. my little girl questioned me “mom who is a islamic terrorist”, why are they calling this bad people as islamic terrorists.

opportunity for jamaat
