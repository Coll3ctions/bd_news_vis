tib report on ngos
the study "problems in good governance in the ngo sector: the way forward" published by transparency international bangladesh (tib) has caused quite a stir in various quarters, with a conspicuous knee-jerk reaction from the ngo sector itself. the study termed the ngos a mid-level corrupt sector that lacked transparency and accountability having irregularities in their dealings. among the more scathing accusations are: many of them bribe officials to get registered with the government; some exist only on paper; they are accountable to donors only and not to the beneficiaries; only a few ngos receive 90 percent of the resources from donors and so on. the ngo leaders found those accusations leveled against the entire sector on the basis of the activities of only 20 organisations as "sweeping comments" and voiced their protest through association of development agencies of bangladesh (adab) and federation of ngos (fnb).

what awaits the al
the bnp, the immediate past party in power, is already divided into rival groups for reasons convincingly advanced by a score of political analysts. this scribe also gave his considered views last week in this space. since the jatiya party (jp) came about in the same way as the bnp (from the hands of another dictator) it is also inevitably in shreds for similar reasons.
musharraf's deal with bhutto: a case of political opportunism
in politics, everything is possible, if it is not based on principles. politics, of course, is all about power. power is a possession, and like any possession, one is determined to retain it. power is the great treasure that you often cheated another to have, especially through a military coup. power makes everything else possible.
soft hands
politics prefers soft hands. why have indian politicians suddenly started playing with knuckledusters? democracy functions best when handled gently. even an unrepentant villain knows that it makes sense to smile and smile even when he wants to be his natural self. that is the law of democratic behaviour. it is a gentle game, even if not a gentleman's game. view the page sports

historical relics
once upon a time this land was ruled by lords, kings and zaminders. during their times, they all tried to create something in their territory, so that even after a thousand years people could see their wonderful creations. the remnants of those days are still there in many places but most of them are not maintained properly. lots of palaces, temples, mosques and other religious monuments have sunk into the black hole of time.
fight for democracy
mark twain once said, “history never repeats itself, it rhymes.” countless times in the history of mankind people have resorted to violence for liberty and freedom, with the ineluctable outcome of bloodshed and conflict. myanmar stands as a witness epitomizing man's imbecility and the failure to learn from past mistakes. yet another outbreak of protest, with an imminent upheaval awaiting the military regime. the repercussions are inevitable: bloodshed, loss of lives and then the coup de grace, the downfall of the dictator.
voter id

power conservation
a local english daily devoted a four page section on power generation issues (sept:29). unfortunately, the major drawback was that none of the lead articles contained anything about power conservation--the key top priority issue for bangladesh reeling under power shortage! if power conservation issue is positively followed up by our government; then we can easily save over 100mw every year for at least the next ten years or so.
issues before un
year after year, the un general assembly allocates to its social, humanitarian and cultural affairs committee, commonly referred to as the “third committee”, agenda items relating to a range of social, humanitarian affairs and human rights issues that affect peoples all over the world. an important part of the committee's work focuses on the examination of human rights questions, including reports of the special procedures of the newly established human rights council. un general assembly which is in session now must address the nefarious (state-sponsored) remote terrorism, including dreams terrorism and remote electric-shocking, unleashed on their citizens and direct the member nations to stop this kind of anti-people, anti-democratic, inhuman activities forthwith. silence on the part of this most important world body signals ill-intentions of the un itself against human beings, irrespective of the country they live in. those nations that specialise in remote terrorism must be adequately penalised economically, technologically and in all other possible ways.

trade imbalance
refer to your editorial 'duty free access for our rmg" that appeared on september 18, 2007, the recently concluded mou on duty-free access for garments exports from bangladesh to the indian market, without any conditionality, is indeed a welcome development. there is clearly a room for many such initiatives to facilitate exports from bangladesh to the growing indian market.
women footballers!
football championship, and if it is world championship, is always a festivity. there is always the ferocity of instinct submerged in the players to outsmart the opposing teams; immensity of expectations in the minds of the spectators in the fields and beyond: the whole earth, as it appears, gets enveloped into some flares of festivity. that very sense of festivity in the minds that actually triumphs over the literal wins or losses comes wrapped in, in essence, in the frames of jubilation. and in the same breath, even on a broader spectrum of beauty, world women football championship 2007 was held and hailed!
monga
a few districts of northern part of bangladesh face acute problem of employment, thus shrinking their earning for livelihood during certain period of the year i.e. sept.-oct. which is termed as monga in local language. during this period there is no requirement for labour for agricultural purpose and having no other opportunity for part-time job, a large number of people are rendered unemployed. these are mostly landless farmers having no academic qualification. the total number should not exceed more than a million even by a wild guess. this number may vary with other factors like drought, flood and natural calamity.
zakat
every year as the holy month of ramadan draws to a close, the sad news hits the front page of the national dailies: deaths of zakat seekers in stampede. the rich or well-to-do muslims provide charity to the poor. but in our country, overcrowded and poor as it is, this tradition is often accompanied by some hazards.
