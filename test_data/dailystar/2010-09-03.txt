us combat role ends in iraq

almost every alternate day a poor bangladeshi is killed by the bsf (border security force) of india. despite flag meetings, inter-ministerial meetings, the killing continues unabated. as reported by the media most of these unfortunate people are either cattle traders or poor farmers, living far below poverty line. bangladesh is all surrounded by india except for in the south. there is all probability that a bangladeshi living in the border area may venture into india knowingly or unknowingly. in the event of such an incident the bsf can easily scare them off by firing blank shots into the air. life is dear to everybody, i am sure no one would like to get killed in this manner.
