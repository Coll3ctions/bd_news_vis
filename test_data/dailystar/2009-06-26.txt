cricket --- and no shame!!
the beauty about the bangladesh cricketers is that they are never ashamed of their acts. i am sorry to say that none of the bd players have minimum intelligence to play the game and their minimum level of iqs needs to be examined. during the bygone days, almost all the cricketers were university students. i think the authorities should go for a minimum education level of the players before they are allowed to play for the national team. it is a game of intelligence in addition to skills and they are lacking it seriously.
climate change and bangladesh
bangladesh is likely to be among the countries that will be the worst affected by climate change. climate change refers to the changes in climatic elements' behaviour due to natural variability and human activity. in the last few decades, extensive floods, cyclones, tidal surges, tsunamis, drought, riverbank erosion, etc., have attacked our country increasingly frequently. the undp has identified bangladesh to be the most vulnerable country in the world to natural disasters. on average, 80 tropical cyclones are formed every year all over the globe. bangladesh is a part of humid tropics, with the himalayas in the north and the funnel shaped coast touching the bay of bengal in the south. this peculiar geography of bangladesh causes not only the life giving monsoons but also catastrophic ravages of cyclones, nor'westers, tornadoes and floods. in the 1991 cyclone, deaths amounted to a figure of 1,40,000. on the other hand, in the 2007 sidr, the total number of deaths was only 3500. but the intensity of the cyclone sidr was more than in the 1991 cyclone. in aila ( on may 25 this year) the total death was 179. this was because of intensive disaster management programme. however, bangladesh is a deltaic country located in the lower part of the basins of the three greatest rivers in the worldthe ganges, the brahmaputra and the meghna. the floodplain of these rivers and their numerous tributaries and distributaries cover about 80 percent of the country. as a result of the flat topography of the floodplain, every year one third of the country is annually flooded which causes a lot of losses. also, the nw region of bangladesh is more prone to drought than others. during the last 50 years, bangladesh suffered about 20 times from drought conditions.
establishment of agricultural university
khulna, being one of the oldest divisional cities, is deprived of an agricultural university, though jessore is one of the prime districts which has been producing various types of crops and vegetables abundantly.
confessional statements
during the tenure of the caretaker government many bigwigs were arrested on corruption charges. many of them gave confessional statements before the magistrates under section 164. most of them are now out and withdrawing the confessional statements given earlier. they have blamed the investigation authorities for extracting statements from them through torture and intimidation. in the current most sensational 10-truck arms haul case investigation, the involved bosses of dfi, nsi have reportedly given confessional statements before the magistrate. one such confessional statement is reported to be the longest and important in the history of "confessional statements" in the country, one which has revealed the names of some godfathers.
online polls
please allow me to congratulate you for introducing the online poll that is conducted in the internet edition of the daily star. it is an innovative effort, and deserves praise. the issues and topics on which the polls are conducted are also very relevant, and of great public interest. i find myself looking forward to the opportunity to voice my opinion through the online polls and also observe the results.
our unique country
has anyone ever wondered at the uniqueness of our country? it is the only country in the world where:
why this controversy?
the moment army chief lt. general moeen u ahmed handed over charge to his successor, we have seen some protests and rallies against this ex army chief under the banner of some student organizations. on the same day, we have also seen some accusations being raised by bnp's lawmaker moudud ahmed and awami league lawmaker suranjit sengupta against general moeen. it is pathetic that the person who is considered as the architect of the 1\11 changeover and the driving force behind the last caretaker government is now in hot water. i won't say that whatever actions the past caretaker government, anti corruption commission took were justified, but i must say that they tried their level best to brought discipline and accountability in every sector which was missing during the regime of our previous governments. holding a free and fair national election was the prime task of the last caretaker government and they were able to do it without any controversy. so now the unnecessary questions and controversy which some vested quarters are trying to create against the actions of the army backed past caretaker government are, i think, ill motivated, ill conceived and will further create more problems than solutions. if we do not give validity to the actions of the past government than the election under its regime will also come under question. this government has many more tasks in hand like solving the nagging power crises, improving the law and order situation, trial of the war criminals etc and therefore it will be wrong from it's part to dwell on the past caretaker government's actions because it will only create more controversy and might even create anarchy in the country as well. can we afford it now? it is the time to move on in order to build the most cherished dream of digital bangladesh and hence i think the government should not allow any quarter to create controversy on this sensitive issue.
new supreme court judges
the daily star report that the government is planning to appoint 13 supreme court judges is encouraging (13 june). it is both an honour and credit for any government to be able to do so; we emphasize however that the would-be judges are vetted thoroughly, particularly those to sit on the appellate division. a certificate from one of the inns of court, or required years in court premises, are rather obsolete criteria and therefore shouldn't qualify them automatically. surely we are not looking for legal luminaries like a. k. brohi or m.c. chagla, but we definitely expect these judges to be experienced, fair, hardworking, have common sense and courage. importantly as well, they are of some repute.
in defence of nosimon
this is a response to ali kabir's letter on "nosimon" published in your page on june 15th. instead of criticising the innovators of this wonderful dual use, very useful irrigation cum transport facility, that has considerably helped our neglected farmers a lot in the villages; we should rather appreciate their creativity. the beauty of this transport cum irrigation (dual purpose) mechanical marvel is that it can quickly and easily become an irrigation pump for the farmer; irrigating his farm and also transporting his products!
