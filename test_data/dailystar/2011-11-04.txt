constitution day is relevant
on november 4, 1971, the nation adopted the constitution of the people's republic of bangladesh. a benchmark in the nation's calendar, the date is conspicuously missing in the array of our designated national days. it is saddening to find the day crowded out from our collective consciousness like any other week day. it exposes our inadequacy to comprehend the singularity of the day in our nation's life perceptively, and accord it a national status as in many countries (in the us, constitution day is a public holiday).
