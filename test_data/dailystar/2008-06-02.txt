from french fry to condiment

nepal: a new beginning

control poverty
poverty is mostly a question of how a country's agricultural land and natural resource systems are managed. if management of resources is based on the principles of equity, productivity and sustainability, then poverty can be beaten back quite successfully. but the way resources are managed in bangladesh goes against these principles and poverty remains predominant. most often, we are breaking up the wrong tree, labelling population growth and shortage of resources as principles reasons behind poverty. bangladesh has one of the most fertile lands in the world and its arable land /population ratio is higher then china, japan, holland which are world leaders in agricultural productivity. reserve forest areas of bangladesh are about 2.9 millions hectares (although much of it without tree covers). bangladesh is also well endowed with natural gas and coal. although not lavishly endowed with natural resources, our endowment cannot be considered meagre. if we can manage our resources very well, poverty alleviation will become an attainable goal.
unhcr's double standards
the un refugee agency, unhcr has been playing a discriminatory role against the rohingya refugees from myanmar in bangladesh.
stress
a disturbed state of mind or body which is caused by overwork, tension or unfriendly situation is called stress. today, law enforcement is widely considered to be among the most stressful occupations, associated with high rates of divorce, suicide and other emotional and health problems such as heart attacks and strokes. public criticism can be a source of stress as well.
population problem
i read the letter on the above subject by shafiqul islam bhuiyan. i was also thinking about this--why in any talk show the so-called intellectuals never address this basic problem of our country. one hundred and seventy million is a horrifying figure!
new police stations
it is heartening to note that eight new police stations are going to be set up soon in dhaka city to deal with the growing violence and other problems.
election commission
the ec is gradually emerging as the most controversial institution. one might ask me why i think so. i think so because if you just recollect the latest deliberation of the cec and two commissioners, you might get the same feeling. the cec has said that if the dialogue fails, the election would be uncertain. one commissioner has said that they are recommending to the government some fundamental constitutional changes, and another commissioner has said that the ec would not take the responsibility if the elections are not held for any other reason, because they would remain prepared for holding the election. they are generating pessimism in public mind. they are over stepping their constitutional jurisdiction. they have successfully maintained their position above any kind of accountability so far.
our problems
the constitutional post of the ombudsman should have been operative in our country. we could have reaped the benefit of social justice. the corruption in our country spread with the administration of the east india company when they minted the one anna copper coin. the company did not question the ordinary holders but would reduce the huge accumulation with surrender by the possessors in the courtyard on a moon-light midnight in a bamboo basket with a live goose over it.
road network
it is needless to mention that the present caretaker govt is taking care of the people, and gained more popularity than any govt did in the past.
sanglap
the much awaited dialogue (i.e.sanglap) commenced between the government and the political parties on may 22nd. this dialogue could be the turning point for bangladesh as far as the circumstances through which the country has been going on are concerned. if the dialogue succeeds the country will be able to hold a credible election. if it fails the country might go back to the situation existing prior to 1/11. the future of the country will be surely uncertain.
tragic death
we always get shocked when a premature death occurs. cu student mahmudul hasan mamun's death was indeed a tragic one. his sudden death brought tears to the cu students and they showed this through violent activities, which is very regrettable.
national holidays
religious fanaticism might have grown in our country to some extent but we bangladeshis also can take pride in religious tolerance and harmony among the followers of all faiths.
ec and politicians
one of the election commissioners told the press on 25 may that the election commission is determined to hold election some time in december and there is no time to tinker with it. he further said that after the completion of voter list in october, the election schedule would be declared. he categorically mentioned the good intentions of the government and also that the political parties would be blamed if election is not held in time.
a positive psc
the public service commission (psc) has shown the highest sense of responsibility by issuing a press release in clarifying the status of 27th bcs results. this is a rare case of showing respect to the public sentiment by a statutory body like the psc. the people have the right to know the status of the results. the psc, before anybody's pointing of finger, disclosed the truth before the public. the psc, in other words, performed the job of ensuring people's right to information. every government department should follow the example of the psc.
form a think tank
i strongly feel that in bangladesh the non-political shushil shamaj should form a formal think tank like the fabian society in england. such a body would have enormous persuasive power to influence any ruling party and lawmakers to bring in legislation for the good of the country with a vision of the future. safe from the hurly burly of politics and policies and machinations to hold on to power from one general election to the next, such a body of learned and involved people would be able to look at the long-term issues for the country.
a-level practical exams
the british government and its examination watchdog, the qca (qualifications and examinations authority), recently approved the draft syllabuses for the new a-levels. the 'post-16' reforms, as these have been termed, see the introduction of more stretch and challenge in assessment and learning with the aim of pushing the brightest pupils to 'think outside the box', a new grade the a* to record performance above that of the a-grade and a reduction in the number of assessment units in most subjects (except the sciences and mathematics) from 6 to 4.
drug abuse tragedy
your staff correspondent's graphical front-page report with photographs (may:26) illustrates real life horror at its worst. the unfortunate mother's statement about her drug addicted son depicts tragedy in real life. the family may have been driven to a corner, with no remedy at hand.
national charter
the ctg has taken bold and long awaited steps to ensure transparency in govt. activities and is working hard to attain certain goals. now, we see a strengthened acc, independent judiciary and election commission, improved law order situation, efficient ports facilitating import and export, improving overall economic infrastructure, in spite of natural calamities, etc. all these laudable achievements are the foundation of a prosperous and democratic nation. none of these was the responsibility of the ctg, but it had no other alternative but to take all these initiatives proactively in the backdrop of the anarchy created by the political parties before 1/11, demand of the civil society and peace-loving people. the govt. had not come to power with a pre-planned agenda, rather they had to develop an agenda to achieve all these common goals after assumption of state power. view the page international
