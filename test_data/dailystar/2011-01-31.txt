the rising spectre of crime
there are serious questions we must raise again about the overall law and order situation in the country. the murder of a journalist and his wife in dhaka a few days ago has only confirmed fears that there is a slide where security of life is concerned. we are yet to see the police come up with any clues relating to the killings. add to these incidents the shooting which left the guard of a residential building in dhaka's shyampur badly injured. there is then the killing of a trader in east rampura. the pattern appears to be distressingly familiar. as if to add to such a feeling, we now have from bogra the story of a girl studying in class seven falling prey to stalking. by itself stalking is a crime, but what makes this incident worse is that the stalker allegedly tried to take the girl's life by slitting her throat. view the page sports

reasons behind traffic jam
of late traffic congestion has become an acute problem. the traffic police are introducing new rules frequently for the drivers, but nothing is working. it seems it is not a manageable problem at all. the number of vehicles is not the reason for such traffic jam. i feel it is the traffic management which is at fault. we remember, during the army backed caretaker government the traffic was well managed and there was less traffic jam. this means, people strictly follow the traffic rules under efficient management. in general, bangladeshis are not a law-abiding nation. here people get proud in flouting the laws than obeying them.

a teacher's responsibility
teaching is a noble profession. but it is very pathetic to observe that some teachers do not show any instance of nobility. i have witnessed and learned that in many schools and colleges some teachers use slang words if any student does any mistake. if any student makes any fault they also abuse their parents verbally. this is not acceptable.
minimum wage of journalists
i would like to draw attention of the people concerned as to the minimum wage of the probationary journalists. not all, but most of the newspapers remunerate the probationary journalists at around tk. 3,000- 4,000/-. to my utter surprise, many do not even pay the journalists during the probationary period as i have recently come to know from some of my friends working in the media. management asks them to work 3-4 months for free and start paying them only upon satisfactory performance at the completion of this period.

power-at-all-cost syndrome
our nation will see the beginning of hard bargains with some parties demanding that elected city/town mayors be thrown out, some others wanting plum portfolios and so on. no party is likely to demand efficient, corrupt-free governance. who are they? who wants to think about them for the next five years?
