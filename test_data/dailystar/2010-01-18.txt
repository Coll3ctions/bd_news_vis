why this claim game?
we are rather surprised by the extreme positions the two political parties have taken in assessing the outcome of the recently concluded visit of the bangladesh pm to india. we find such a stance reflective of lack of maturity and not up to the intellect and wisdom that one expects of political leadership at the top. it is certainly not the way to look at sensitive issues, particularly when that has to do with as complex a relationship as that of india and bangladesh.
with jyoti basu, an era ends
the death of jyoti basu at ninety six brings to an end an illustrious career in west bengal and indian politics. there was always something intrinsically substantive about basu. his long journey in politics, his primacy in its growth and expansion, indeed the way he stamped his authority and influence on it turned him, long before his death, into a household name not just in india but around the globe. there was the larger than life individual in him, a man dedicated fully and unequivocally to a cause.
a great bengali bids farewell
there was the leonine about him. jyoti basu was precisely what his name epitomised. he was light unto millions of bengalis on the other side of the historical divide. he was a politician the likes of whom will never be again, for it was a grand combination of ideology and conviction which worked as the underpinning of his politics in all the decades that saw him transformed from student to lawmaker to chief minister to elder statesman.
time to think outside the box
what should have been a regular visit to india by prime minister sheikh hasina suddenly became a much-hyped and talked about trip. though, before the visit actually took place, it was the media that to some extent kicked up a lot of dust on the upcoming visit, and political parties, especially the opposition bnp, joined the bandwagon later and began raising the usual cries against the ruling party, going to the extent that begum zia threatened to lay thorns along sheikh hasina's path if she returned "empty handed" from india. view the page sports
shakib's boys win day one
the morning didn't show the day for the indians at the zahur ahmed chowdhury stadium in the port city on sunday. india amassed 63 runs without losing any wicket from 13 overs in the first session giving indication that the much-praised batting line-up were going to pile up a mammoth total after bangladesh captain shakib al hasan had decided to bowl first to exploit the overcast condition. many might have been frustrated by the performance of the local bowlers in the first session but everything changed dramatically after the lunch session when india lost wickets like ninepins, thanks to the disciplined bowling effort by the bangladeshi bowlers, especially shakib and shahadat hossain were outstanding. it was a disastrous second session for india as they lost six wickets for 97 runs. and at the end of the day, tigers proved that they have the quality to pull off surprise even in the longer-version of the game as an improving side. sachin tendulkar may have stood tall to frustrate shakib's men a little bit but it was a memorable day nonetheless for the tigers considering the fact that the indian batting had hardly collapsed like that in the recent past when making over 400 runs has become a common feature of their batting.

sachin asks to wait & see
when sachin tendulkar attended the press briefing after scoring an unbeaten 76 on an eventful first day of the opening test against bangladesh at chittagong yesterday, the batting maestro was up against some obvious yet bitter questions that interestingly had nothing to do with his outstanding effort under pressure that also saw him cross the 13,000-run milestone.

street people
as i travel early in the morning, i can see them lying on the pavements, on the road dividers under the footbridges. it is evident that they have nowhere to go : no shanty or shack made of plastic and thatched bamboo. in other words they have no makeshift shelter, let alone a house. to ward off cold they make fire and burn garbage which gives off an acrid smoke .as the whole country is reeling under a cold wave, the misery of these homeless people is imaginable.
solar power
i appreciate dr. shabbir a. bashar for his article entitled solar power as a prime energy source in bangladesh? published in the daily star of december 26, 2009. it is very timely particularly when our policy makers are busy like anything to promote solar energy in the country without looking in its cost benefit. in this regard, i want to add a few more points here.

pollution and purification!
here we are dumping chemical dyes in the river, and at the same time, cleaning it up! what a contrasting phenomenon that reflects our total unawareness about environment pollution and poisoning! mixing dyes on the riverbank should be a punishable criminal offence, not far removed from what rid pharmaceuticals did to paracetamol syrup for babies!
foreign exchange
bangladesh is missing millions of foreign exchange just because of a wrong decision.
new year's resolution
a new year's resolution is a commitment that a person makes to a venture or reforming of a habit, frequently a lifestyle transformation that is normally interpreted as beneficial. the name comes from the reality that these commitments in general have an impact on new year's day and linger until satisfied or discarded.
environmental disaster
it is generally agreed that the world is facing a serious environmental problem due to global warming. because of this, extreme events, for instance cyclone, tornado, flood, draught, sea-level rise, vector-borne diseases and other natural calamities are appearing recurrently. anyhow, at the end of the year 2007, there was a terrifying cyclone 'sidr' in bangladesh, which was one of the serious consequences of global climate change. we can still remember the fateful night of november 15; 220 km per hour windstorm accompanied by a 30-foot high tidal-bore that hit manikkhali under burirchar union of borguna upazila and talatali of amtali upazila.

gender discrimination
to treat the boys and girls unequally is called gender discrimination. naturally, in a male dominated country, the males enjoy more facilities than the females. the females suffer form an inferiority complex and the males feel themselves superior to the females.
cold wave deaths
at least 60 people have died this winter in the cold wave. news reports from various print and e-media have mentioned that the cold wave is severe. it is so pathetic that so many people died because of cold, probably for the first time in bangladesh. the southern districts are the worst hit.
india issue
we shouldn't forget that blood groups, stature, colour of pupil and other physical and cultural heritage, etiquette, manners and thought process of benglaee muslims and bengalee hindus are very similar, except religious belief. we also shouldn't forget that for historical reasons bengalee hindus of lower castes or oppressed hindus had been converted to islam to save themselves from hindu zemindars and feudal lords created by east india company. that is part of history, whether you like it or not.
prospects of sports tourism
sports and tourism are very interrelated and complementary. sports and tourism share common goals, which build bridges of understanding among different cultures, lifestyles and traditions, promoting peace and goodwill among nations, motivating and inspiring young people and providing entertainment and enjoyment to relieve the pressures of daily life to large sections of the population.
natural variability of climate
it is an irony to see the 'warmists' acknowledge the natural variability of climate in their january 6 press release stating that the coldest northern winter in 40 years " does not disprove global warming" because the bitter winter weather is simply a short term "blip" and a manifestation of "the natural variability of climate". had it been the warmest winter in 40 years they would surely be singing a different tune.
