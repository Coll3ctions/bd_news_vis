towards saving the rivers
the high court's emphatic and comprehensive set of directives to the government that it take targeted and time-bound action to reclaim the four endangered rivers augurs well. it constitutes a high-water mark in the campaign to save the choked up life-lines to the city. in fact, the judicial intervention can be seen as a turning point from what has so far been an awareness building exercise followed by a determined, yet occasionally halted, eviction operation, into giving a massive push for concrete result-oriented action from here on.
evolving disaster management
effective disaster management has not been one of our strong points. it is disconcerting indeed that in a disaster-prone country we have no legal framework to guide protective, rescue and rehabilitation activities to minimise sufferings of the people. while various forms of calamities strike us the year round, what we do in reality is to react in bafflement and then sit down to form a committee to assess the damages wreaked and lives lost or displaced. we hardly see local level community leaders included in such committees who could come up with worthy suggestions.
democracy and development
democratic political systems are generally seen as best suited to protect and guarantee human rights and to deliver social and economic development. from that point of view, it is also accepted that a democratic process is vital for addressing the political aspect of poverty. being accountable to citizens, enable democratic governments to chart a political course supported by people and to be able to change it when needed. this will however be possible only if we are able to bring together a broader understanding of democracy where there is juxtaposition of the procedural and institutional aspects with the delivery element.
india's tiananmen square

contentious tipaimukh
it is true that without strong and close indian support bangladesh could not have attained independence. it is also true that at the initial stage of our independence india helped us rehabilitate and reconstruct our country. thus the relationship between india and bangladesh should have been close and cordial based on a clear mutual understanding. of course when the interest of the states clash the strength of understanding is tested. building the tipaimukh dam for production of hydro-electricity, irrigation and to control flood has created an atmosphere of mutual suspicion. view the page sports

while dhaka hits the global headlines as one of the fastest growing cities in the world by population, unplanned development, enhanced by land encroachment and flouting of legal requirements, irresponsible approach to professional obligations by all and sundry, and display of the 'thumb' by the greedy and corrupt, has led the housing situation to an ever-shifting brink where today more than a third of the urban population four decades into our independence live in dire conditions, unimaginable for many.

introduction
urbanization in bangladesh has progressed very rapidly and today more than 25 percent of the total population of the country lives in urban areas. simultaneously, dhaka now contains 40 percent of the national urban population. existing physical and social amenities have failed to provide for even the basic needs of the majority of these people. as a result, today more than 35 percent of the people living in dhaka city are residents of slums and squatter settlements. a large section of the lower middle income group also lives in very critical conditions. in the face of multifarious deficiencies, housing remains a most urgent need to be addressed. view the page literature

kali o kolom asharh 1416 - june 2009
the present government's incompetence in terms of power supply is not only causing untold miseries during a sweltering heat wave to an electorate that trusted it to govern, and govern well, but is also ruining my writing of kali o kolom reviews. since i happen to live in an ordinary neighbourhood without montri mohadois nearby on whose uninterrupted power grids i could have a free ride, i am victim to savage load shedding. the power disruptions have frayed my temper to the point where the joy in carrying out my otherwise pleasurable monthly task has vanished. so if this particular review seems somewhat disorganized, i beg the indulgence of readers. i confess that even though i was delighted at the election result i'm now radically revising my opinion. a plague, i feel like spewing, on both political houses - capulet and montague!

wish
if i were an idle april noon
i would go and watch in your eyes
some blades of grass.
sad musical bells,
i would go and dance with your rhythmic feet,
weeping tears of blood,
and suddenly an april fire
would burst into flames.
if i were a copper coloured telegraph wire
i would relay to you all my failures,
any unfinished songs,
grief stricken flowers.
oh, if i were only a little boy
in this month of impossible desires.
guessing by what i glimpsed
i still haven't been able to figure out
which is more potent:
the river or its current?
it could be the river
for its bank contains
fish and the ebb and flow of tides
and displays both restlessness and placidity.
it could be the river,
to which our green rice fields
remain indebted.
but the current?
no, i'll never know what it is capable of,
guessing by what i glimpsed of it
in 1971!
remembering
as we sit here and remember you, the calmness of
eyes we had never seen before is overthrown
and muddied; the chant of a million voices deadened,
briefly, in the silence of yours;
atlas
left you an atlas to look
at and
feel your way back into
togetherness
the pages are a bit frayed at the edges
and one or two pages may actually
be missing but
it is quite a complete guide
to an utterly, shatteringly lonely planet. view the page star health

myth! in this age of information explosion that may not always be an index for acquiring more and more knowledge vis-à-vis an erratic pace of technological advancement. who would possibly believe in the slightest that a myth has a role to play in human life? at first it is likely to sound anachronistic in terms of its being a story trying to explain an event, an occurrence involving some imaginary characters that is seemingly incomprehensible to the human mind. but there is so much more in a myth than meets the eye as karen armstrong takes us deep into the meaning, import, workability, congeniality and most of all into the humane qualities of it. she shows that a myth always existed in human life and, therefore, in a society, whatever kind that may be. her utterances about a myth are intertwined with the mental state that one comes across in a heightened form of religious experiences that once were only liturgical in essence. a human life since that paleolithic age down to our immediate environs is fraught with struggles, causing despair, distress, threats, challenges of various hues and magnitudes and eventually an end of this life culminating in death.
posthumous examination of a political party
flogging a dead horse might appear a pointless, not to say bizarre, exercise to many, unless that effort is expended towards explaining a momentous event in history. the emergence of bangladesh as a sovereign independent nation-state is indubitably one such occurrence. the muslim league (ml) is very much alive and kicking in its various factions in pakistan, but it is, to all intents and purposes, at death's door in the land of its birth, bangladesh. as a matter of fact, the party that was the political vehicle in the process of realizing pakistan out of british india embarked on the road to its demise almost as soon as pakistan came into being. a whole range of scholarly writings has explored a whole range of aspects that led to the league's debacle, and, undoubtedly, others will emerge in the future. ahmed kamal's state against the nation is among the more recent additions to this list.
the sorrows of lonely women
dohon o droher golpo is a collection of thirteen stories about women, all of whom suffer in life and in death. as they suffer they also revolt against the norms of society, a society that is oppressive towards them. it humiliates them, tortures them and then stands up high with pride. as if the whole world is just created for men to rule over their counterparts. in the name of religion they both torture and squash them in their very own home. society is against women who stand up to protest their malpractices. we all see it around us. it is these writers who paint it on their canvas, make it possible for everyone to understand it better. more than a dozen women are depicted who were really the victims of our modern day society. the male members of their family, even the very near and dear ones, do not spare women when it comes to finding faults with them.
african males go to europe
early in tahar ben jelloun's eye-opening novel of arab illegals crossing from tangier into southern spain, the author describes a cat that sneaks aboard a ship headed across the straits of gibraltar: “even the cat was fed up: he, too, wanted something else from life, and needed tenderness, caresses, a kind family who would spoil him. the cat wanted to go away because he knew instinctively that it was better 'over there,' and he had his obsessions like everyone else, coming stubbornly every day to try his best to jump onto [a] vessel bound for europe.”
