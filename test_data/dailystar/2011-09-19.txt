does islam support terrorism?
are muslims really behind the 9/11attacks? islam is always being blamed for these attacks, but does islam really support terrorism? the prophet (pbuh) said, "kindness is a mark of faith, and whoever is not kind has no faith." he (pbuh) also said, "a muslim is a brother of another muslim. so he should neither oppress him nor hand him over to an oppressor. and whoever fulfills the needs of his brother, allah will fulfill his needs." after reading at least these two hadiths, we can be sure that islam does not support terrorism. but it is sad that many muslims do not know this and non muslims spread unpleasant statements against islam. i would urge all the muslims to stand united and defend this peaceful religion, islam.

we must raise our voice
it is an amazing country as law enforcing authorities here cannot take action against motor drivers with false licenses; they can not take action to stop unfit vehicles from plying the city roads because those drivers and the owners demonstrate on the street. it is amazing that the law enforcing authorities take action against them at a time when the need for transport is the highest, that is during eid. it is surprising that the authorities responsible for repairing the roads wait to see that the roads are damaged severely during the rainy season, so that the repair cost and the sufferings of the commuters reach the peak. it isshocking that the distance we travelled by train in nine hours fifty years back, takes the same timenow. it is unfortunate that all the governments after liberation neglected this sector.

change in the constitution
i sincerely thank mr samad for his letter entitled "the constitution is not a scripture." he wrote, "it is not a divine and infallible edict and criticizing it should not mean that we have to question that person's loyalty, allegiance or patriotism. the constitution itself guarantees the right to free speech. the irony is that the constitution also guarantees certain fundamental human rights and expressly prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. yet on a daily basis, in the name of remand, citizens routinely face police brutality in the form of threats, intimidation and torture.” however, i have a doubt whether our politicians will pay any attention to this letter. al government is now using constitution to torture people and kill democracy again. corruption is not permitted in the constitution but both al and bnp made this nation champion in corruption several times. alas! these two parties talk for the constitution more than others. influencing the judiciary is absolutely against the fundamental principles of the constitution.

one of the many interesting disclosures about bangladesh politics by the whistleblower of secret american diplomatic cables, wikileaks, in a recent release claimed that a few months after the incumbent awami league-led grand alliance had taken office, the commerce minister faruk khan offered a piece of good advice to prime minister sheikh hasina. it was that unless the government did some good work, the opposition may be voted into office in the next election, and in that case they (that is, leaders of incumbent government) might have to end up in jail.
