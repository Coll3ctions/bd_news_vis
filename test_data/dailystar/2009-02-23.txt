nearing a shipbuilding boom!
it is indeed encouraging to note that shipbuilding to cater to overseas buyers is becoming a fast growing sector for bangladesh. already we have exported a number of ocean going cargo vessels and orders for more are in the pipeline. to be precise, bangladesh has $500 million worth of export orders in hand to deliver ships by 2010. it augurs well that contribution by the sector would comprise 3 to 4 percent of gdp by 2015, and that export earning can go up to $2 billion in near future. it will be no mean feat considering the tough competition coming from major shipbuilders of europe and asia. right now, the continued faith of foreign buyers in our ability to deliver only reinforces our confidence that we no more lag behind in heavy industrial production and that our quality matches that of any reputable international manufacturer. therefore, to stay in the market as an important player, we shall have to modernise and innovate constantly.
this dangerous living must stop
the report appearing in this newspaper that people are continuing to occupy agb colony buildings despite the fact that these had been declared dangerous and unfit for living more than five years ago is very disconcerting indeed. in effect more than 100 families are putting their lives at risk every minute of the day in these quarters. although the authorities have managed to shift the occupants of the other hazardous buildings in the complex, as far as the eight in question, the authorities have done nothing beyond warning the occupants from time to time.

young minds, old hatreds

bangla pronunciation
the article by former un economist mr. mahfuzur rahman (18 feb), “in defence of standard bangla pronunciation” is a timely reminder that the bengali language binds us in a nation, and that its standardization in written and spoken form is a must to preserve this unity. this goal has already been diluted by inadvertent slide and confusion between 'bangla bhasha' and 'matri bhasha'. there is a clear distinction between a 'language or bhasha' and a tongue or 'buli'. bangla bhasha has a history of at least a thousand years of development behind it. it has an evolved alphabet, grammar, lexicon and literary richness which most mother tongues in the land do not have. but above all it has the singular advantage of being readily understood in any part of our country provided an existing standard, whether written or spoken, is followed.
stop human trafficking
human trafficking is the recruitment, transportation, harbouring, or receipt of people for the purposes of slavery, forced labour (including bonded labour or debt bondage), and servitude. the total annual revenue for trafficking in people is estimated to be between $5 billion to $9 billion. the council of europe states that people trafficking has reached epidemic proportions over the past decade, with a global annual market of about $42.5 billion. trafficking victims typically are recruited using coercion, deception, fraud, abuse of power, or outright abduction. threats, violence, and economic leverage such as debt bondage can often make victim consent to exploitation.
education
education in the public universities in bangladesh is turning into a failure: in the world of speed, technology and creativity, students in the universities are stuck with session jams, horrendous politics and worm-eaten notebooks. politics in the universities should voice the demands of the students; i never heard anybody talking about the filthy toilets of dhaka university, poor management of the libraries, age-old system of question formation, just to name a few problems. nobody says 'sorry' for all the 'unavoidable circumstances' to avoid schedule classes. there is never any research to work out how students can get 'in campus jobs' so that they do not have to live a humiliating life.
genetic science
genetic science has a great potential for either serving or degrading humanity. its proper use requires moral reflection and the establishment of moral limits. human welfare does not demand that scientists pursue every avenue available.
deeds speak louder
obviously, a huge number of television channels are playing a significant role to convey us the up-to-date information regularly. their duty is to collect news. to get, find out or even create news they will trail the potential sources, it is usual. but our key chair holders forget that they hold very important posts. they have to take many confidential decisions which will affect the nation. astonishingly, we notice, after concluding or even before ending the meeting, a member comes out, stands in front of the microphone and spontaneously speak about what had been discussed or decided. you are doing your job. you are not a newsmaker. so, please control yourselves.
are they students?
we, the students of jahangir-nagar university, are greatly shocked at the incident that happened on monday, 16 february. as an eyewitness to the incident, i still could not believe how a student could beat his student brother in such a merciless way. it is unbelievable that university students could do such a heinous thing.
immediate past president

currency issue
what is a paper currency? it is a mode of exchange, it is a piece of paper with no value of its own. there are many instances of economies of countries collapsing just due to exchange rates of their currencies.
road accidents
all the tv channels now telecast several programmes to raise awareness regarding aids. it is really a positive scheme. a huge number of people of india, our closest neighbour, are badly affected by this disease. in this situation, our tv channels are playing a vital role and deserve thanks from the citizens of the country. it must also be noted that the hazards of aids is comparatively less in our country compared to india.
negative politics
all actions and all steps taken by opponents are not anti-state or anti-people.
where will they go?
i hardly can remember the exact number of students who, nowadays, get gpa 5 in the ssc or even the hsc since the number is too high to remember!
price of lentil?
your front page report on february 10 from your correspondent at pabna is terrible. it brings back to me, its similarity to john galsworthy's play titled "the price of coal" which i read way back in 1948. the play depicted the tragic death of miners in underground mine accidents. the incident in pabna, although no accident, is the loss of five lives and injury to twenty persons over quarrel for crop cutting of lentils! that too from a land that is not owned by any of the two groups in the quarrel, as reported.
worsening crime situation
the grand alliance government led by the awami league has many priorities. but improving law and order must not be ignored. heinous crimes are on the rise. hijacking, mugging even killing are going unabated when so called block raids and special drives are on. both the ministers appear to be too shy to talk about it. this is a very ominous sign for a government, so enthusiastically voted to power.
wildlife conservation
with the country needing to find food, water, shelter, energy, timber and medicine for a new mouth every alternate second, our forests and wild landscapes face fresh and bigger threats.
statistical error
i was reading one article from your february 13, 2009 edition. in the sports section, there was an article entitled "messi steals the show" about the france vs argentina friendly football game. i have noticed statistical errors in it.
scientific education
while the slogan “science for all” has been appreciated and accepted by most people, and scientific development is going on with the speed of light almost everywhere, the area of scientific ignorance among people of bangladesh is widening. the situation is worse than even before because the politicians were almost silent as if it is not an important issue. they were more interested in importing science than local creation or innovation. the politicians should not be blamed fully because they became silent observing the previous activities of the responsible scientists in different sectors. it is pertinent to raise an important point here that all sciences are not science and all scientists are not real scientists. the main thing is to give the right person the right responsibilities. otherwise, he will just pass time and destroy the whole system. view the page international
