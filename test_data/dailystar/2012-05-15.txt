according to the big bang theory, the universe came into being with a violent explosion from which all matter and energy originated. at the zero hour, the entire known universe was a mathematical point of infinite density, called the singularity, from which matter and energy burst out and the universe began to expand. this cataclysmic event occurred, as estimated by hubble, approximately 14 billion years ago
a brief history of the house of wisdom
the legendary bayt al-hikma meaning “house of wisdom” was a library and a translation institute established somewhere later in the 8th century by caliph harun al-rashid which later flourished under the rule of his son caliph al-mamun and his immediate successors. this ancient grand institution was modeled after the sassanid imperial library (the pre-islamic persian empire, 224-651 ad), given the strong bond that abbasid caliphate had with the persians, a great association which many experts believe spawned the very birth of islamic golden period in the first place. it is in this house of wisdom, for the next 4 to 5 hundred years alchemists, scientists, scholars, writers, men of letters, copyists painstakingly learned, read, wrote and translated manuscripts that were originally farsi, aramaic, syriac, hebrew, greek, latin, sankrit, devnagari and other languages and linguistically converted them into arabic and circulated the arabic translated texts throughout the then arabic speaking world. in this process many works by ancient persian, greek and indian scholars like aryabhata and brahmagupta were translated and further researched which was also one of the tasks of the historic library. there were a couple of technical reasons why house of wisdom was in baghdad. for starter, it was the then capital of islamic empire and secondly it was in baghdad where, during this era, world's very first recorded paper mill was established which made it possible for widespread literacy in that region and by 10th century paper replaced the usage of parchment and papyrus in the arab world. and that era was glory times for baghdad, which was known as the world's richest city housing over a million people, not by the might of oil by the way, and a true centre for the intellectual development of that time, a great accomplishment that many modern day arab states failed to achieve even at this day and age regardless of their immense monetary wealth and easy access to global scholarship.

all the world's water
if all the world's water were to form a single drop, this is how big it would be: a sphere stretching from salt lake city, utah to topeka, kansas. though this mega-droplet looks small compared to earth's bulk, the two dimensionality of this image is somewhat deceiving. in fact, the water sphere would have a diameter of about 860 miles (1,385 kilometers) and a volume of about 332,500,000 cubic miles (1,386,000,000 cubic km).
who invented first computing machime?
in 1822, charles babbage purposed and began developing the difference engine, considered to be the first automatic computing engine that was capable of computing several sets of numbers and making a hard copies of the results. unfortunately, because of funding he was never able to complete a full-scale functional version of this machine. in june of 1991, the london science museum completed the difference engine no 2 for the bicentennial year of babbage's birth and later completed the printing mechanism in 2000.
