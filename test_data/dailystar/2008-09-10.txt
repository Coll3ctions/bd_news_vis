a brief history of handshakes in our times
zillur rahman, the veteran awami league politician, was spotted shaking hands with the jamaat-e-islami's motiur rahman nizami at a saudi embassy iftar a few days ago. nothing wrong with that, you just might argue. shaking hands, after all, is a social thing. if you do not proffer your hands to the individual standing across from you, or before you, you might end up being accused of rudeness or arrogance. that is a point we do not overlook, except that in this instance it was a man whose party has regularly accused that of the other of criminality of the most vicious kind being seen in the company of a man routinely charged with culpability in the genocide perpetrated in 1971. so what do you do now?

akbar's article on zakir naik
abu imran (august 3, 2008) complained about mj akbar's use of the word "evangelist" to describe zakir naik. mr. imran's objection is that zakir naik is not an evangelist in the dictionary definition of the word as it applies strictly to preachers of gospel. while mr. imran is not wrong, he's a little misguided about mj akbar's use of the term. you see, language is fluid, and words are used in various ways. mj akbar knows full well what the dictionary-definition of 'evangelist' is, but chose to use it loosely. one could for example, construct sentences like "barack obama is a prophet for change." does that literally mean obama is a 'prophet'? of course not. meanings of words flow freely, add to that often usage is ironic, derisive, purposefully exaggerated and so on.
