dumbfounding fiasco
the planned exhibition of bangladeshi archeological artefacts at a french museum has been abandoned under circumstances which will definitely invoke lots of queries and questions in the public mind. it is the latest example of an important matter being so awfully mishandled, that even our diplomatic relations with france might come under strain. however, what the french charge de affairs said about the protestors has, to our mind, been unthinking and undiplomatic which we wish he had better avoided.

victory day: an observation
a very positive thing happened this victory day: no banners and no slogans. in future banners and slogans must be done away with. and the events proved beyond doubt that year after year bangladesh produces some of the best planned events in the world. this land is brimming with talent. the level of culture and design of events this year was just impeccable.
sidr: a recurring misfortune?
in 1991, i experienced the destruction of cyclone gorky. at that time i felt how much insecure we people were. today when i see the sufferings of the sidr-affected people and areas, i still find people being helpless facing the crude wrath of nature. this is indeed very unfortunate. years passed since gorky, we still remain as vulnerable as we were. bangladesh being a delta with most of its parts in coastal areas, will face natural disasters like cyclone, hurricane or even tsunami very often. therefore, we must fortify ourselves to fight such calamities. there should be public awareness campaigns for disaster management in these coastal areas throughout the year. people of these coastal areas should be trained on safeguarding themselves along with their belongings such as cattle during the disaster. there should also be clear understanding and knowledge on the needful to be done after the crisis. adequate number of cyclone centres should be developed in these areas. all schools, colleges, mosques or other infrastructure should be developed in such a way so that they can serve as shelters during the disaster period. we expect relief operation to go ahead in order for people in the cyclone battered areas to return to a semblance of normalcy. i have been informed by a newspaper that 14 million people are yet out of shelter or rescue coverage. this is indeed shocking! i urge the government, the private sector and ngos to identify the poor of these coastal areas and rehabilitate them with enough resources to fight back. the weather forecasting team should be more efficient and updated to deliver the right news at the right time.
reburial issue
may i take this opportunity to compliment gen. moeen u. ahmed for all the good work he has been doing. however, i write this letter not just to praise him but to broach the subject of reburial of the seven birshresthos. i would like to request him to reconsider his proposal to re-bury the birshreshthos at the jatiyo smriti shoudha. i have the highest regard for the heroes and all the fellow comrades who gave their lives for the cause of our liberation. being fully aware of the sensitivity of this matter, i would submit that a nation is larger than the glorious war of independence. jatiyo smriti shoudha is not just about the shahids of special ranks and honour roll; it is for all those who fought for the war - all those dead or alive. it is an icon of the entire nation. i am personally aware of many valiant freedom fighters - some dead and some alive who did not receive any gallantry award. no wonder, in many countries there are national memorials for the unknown soldiers.
population planning
mahmood's letter on the matter (nov.30) was all about family planning than anything else. however, in bangladesh context; resettlement or relocating families is out of question. i firmly believe that we must again go for a population management (coined by mahmood) programme with determination and full mobilisation; if needed with the support of the armed forces as and where needed.
university teachers
since our teachers cannot be disciplined by the law, and that they cannot discipline themselves, the only recourse for the people of bangladesh is to impose upon them the discipline of the market.
sidr victims
i read with great interest the article by farida akhter on the above subject as it appeared in the daily star on 17 december. the author has aptly echoed the feelings and sentiments of many of us. following the recent devastations in vast areas of the coastal districts, we have heard our parents and grand-parents say how we, the solvent people, can be of help to the poor sidr victims.
