dhaka's moribund rivers
the message that has come out loud and clear from a roundtable organised by the daily star last thursday on pollution of the rivers around dhaka is that the four major rivers around the capital and its suburbs, which had for so long sustained it, are dying. the rivers are depleting not only in quantity but also in quality. and regrettably, it is the industrial units that must share the major responsibility for the present state.
railways in a shambles
bangladesh railways, performing well below the expectations of passengers for a long time, appear to be caught in a vicious cycle of mismanagement and poor supervision. a photograph published in this newspaper on wednesday does show that even the safety factor, which gives the trains an edge over road transports, is being ignored by the railway managers. obviously, when metallic clips that hold the rails to the sleepers are stolen, and yet the trains move along those tracks, the safety of passengers does not seem to figure prominently in the railways' operational plans. but that is exactly what has happened near the mohakhali level crossing in the city. locals complained that drug addicts have removed the clips. there may be truth in their observation, but what we find extremely difficult to comprehend is how could such matters go unnoticed? if the railway authorities cannot deal with some drug addicts how are they going to handle the organised groups of thieves and looters who are responsible for the present state of the railways?

iraq: the forgotten war

obama's speech in turkey and hope for a better world
president barak obama is truly a breath of fresh air in every sense of the term. that his presence means bush is no longer around is in itself great news. it is for good reasons that the story about god telling the guy who came to white house looking for bush made such rounds on the internet. when the guy came the first day to white house and asked god about bush, he was told he lived there no longer. the guy came a second day; asked the question again and received the same answer. when he came a third day and asked the same question, an irate god asked him why he was asking the same question knowing what the answer would be. the guy's answer, with a broad smile was, to hear from god over and over again that bush is history. view the page star books review
the struggle to beat poverty
however one may like to look at the situation with rose-tinted glasses, or however one may juggle with statistics and cleverly concocted spin to make the glass look just a bit more than half full at present, and not too far off from being full, even overflowing, the stark reality is that over half the population of bangladesh lives below the poverty line, and this country does not seem like breaking out of the relatively less developed syndrome for the foreseeable future, say fifty years on. this last bit, in all probability, will draw some indignant remonstrations, but, unless i am proven otherwise, and i sincerely hope i am, i will stick to my guns and remain a cynic.
vanishing forests and exploited workers
leaf storm , the first novel by widely acclaimed author gabriel garcia marquez, depicts the pain of native south americans and the indigenous red indian people in the city of arakataka, colombia, against the backdrop of commercial banana plantation by the us based united fruits company. the novel narrates brutal oppression by the multinational company of local plantation workers and grabbing of their own land and forest resources for the sake of earning cash.
the classes that construct a society
western sociology, specifically american sociology is notoriously ahistorical. this ahistoricity can be located within the trajectories of the emergence of the discipline itself, when the discourse of modernity provides both epistemological and methodological foundations for sociology. born during the tumultuous aftermath of the french revolution, the discipline became “scientific sociology” that explicitly adopted positivism, that is, application of natural science methods to “ discover” the “laws” that govern society. in it, situating historical dimensions while explaining social phenomena was systematically ignored. the emergence of marxism in the mid-nineteenth century coincided with that of “scientific sociology,” and fundamentally altered the very idea of sociology. marxism, along with german sociologist max weber's contributions, laid down the contours of historical sociology that influenced countless sociologists worldwide.
words, words, words
language is sometimes, when you are in the mood to be serious about it, a search for roots. you call it etymology. you call it going back to heritage. when you think of english, you think too of the inroads other languages have made into it. indeed, you wonder at the many ways in which these languages, notably french, have enriched english, have given it the solidity it enjoys today.
