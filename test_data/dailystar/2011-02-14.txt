please, do something
recently, an extremely shocking news item in one of the daily newspapers traumatised me. according to the news, on 23 january, some hoodlums in iswardi, pabna killed an ssc examinee named sorna khatun (15) after gang raping her. a gang of 12 kidnapped the girl from her home at gun point in presence of her family members and forcibly raped her. afterwards they broke her legs, gauged her eyes and hanged her body from a tree. i really don't understand why we cannot ensure social security for our women at all levels and why there is no effective initiative to vigorously counteract such incidents. unless we ensure exemplary punishments for the beasts that commit such brutal crimes, we will never be able to build a safer society for our women. if i was the prime minister or the home minister of the country, i would personally go to the field, ensure quick arrest of each of those culprits and personally arrange a swift public trial to ensure that they are publicly executed after meticulous tortures. i think our law enforcers, public representatives, judiciary and our policy makers are responsible for the creation of a social context where such unspeakable violence against women can go unpunished. such incidents have almost become an inevitable part of our social life and we seldom get to know if the criminals are eventually brought to justice. my sole message to the people who can do something is: “please do something”.

government's electoral pledges
even if the ruling party tries to blame the results of the municipal elections on other factors such as rebel candidates, it is quite apparent from the result that the popularity of the party does really seem to be on the decline. the party which came to power with a landslide victory in the 2008 general elections is losing focus within 2 years of its tenure. there is a tendency within the members of the ruling party to simply ignore the “reading on the wall” and to be in a state of denial and come up with explanations that are sometimes irrational.

selling love to the loveless
valentine's day. flowers everywhere. card and gift shops are offering enticements products and the lounges are decked in red. amid all this special attention to that special someone, being single can be a downer. if it helps, you are not the only lonely one out there and at least you aren't trading your desperation to find that 'man' or 'woman' for the ratings of one particular tv show. yes, i'm talking about "the bachelor/bachelorette".

egyptians claim their stake
anew egypt has emerged after president hosni mubarak's ouster from power in the wake of 18 days of mass revolt. tahrir square in cairo, egypt's capital, where hundreds of thousands of cairenes gathered to voice their anger against widespread poverty, unemployment, corruption and misrule, which finally transformed into a single issue demanding mubarak's resignation from office, kept the world glued to it since january 25 when the uprising broke out.
egypt finds its destiny
salahuddin ayyubi, more familiar as saladin, would have understood what was happening in cairo 2011 perfectly. when, eight centuries ago, he set out from damascus to recapture jerusalem, he headed not towards any crusader state dotted across the map of arab asia, but marched instead to cairo to destroy the rotting regime that had infected egypt with smug impotence. saladin knew, and said, that an arab victory was impossible without the mobilisation of the heart of the arab world. the epicentre had shifted from baghdad with the decay of the abbasids, and there it lies still.
challenging the autocrats
it was ben ali first, then hosni mubarak, who is next? this question is in the minds of all the freedom-desiring citizens of the world. unchallenged autocrats are really being challenged by the suppressed, deprived, poor and suffering citizens, irrespective of religion, political ideology, age, sex and education or professional status. the only demand of those revolutionary people is a free and just society where citizens can enjoy freedom and better living standards.
who moved my cheese?
recently, i called on finance minister a.m.a. muhith. i was amazed to see this over 75- year old "youngman" maintaining appointments in his digital diary. this is exactly what he meant in 2008, in a television interview, while talking on his party's election manifesto with reference to the party's commitment towards building a "digital" bangladesh. how far have we moved towards this goal? we don't have any definitive answer.
dr. ahmed sharif: an ocean of wisdom
february 13 was the 90th birth anniversary of dr. ahmed sharif, a researcher, teacher and renowned writer. we had gathered at his residence in 1999 to celebrate his birthday. even though there was singing and recitation of poems our revered sir was very thoughtful. someone proposed that we observe this day somewhere outside the resident of dr. ahmed sharif, and everyone agreed. at this, dr. sharif said: "surely you may celebrate the next birthday in grandeur, but at that time i may not be alive." his prophecy came true when he died 11 days later.
