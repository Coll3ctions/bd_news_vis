may day
the observance of may day is in essence a remembrance of the sacrifices made by some brave men in chicago in 1886 in defence of their rights as workers. that these men called forth the courage to let their employers know and then let the world know that the pursuit of happiness in life came from sharing in the resources of the earth is a tale we celebrate this morning. and we do so because it was these men who instilled in all of us the idea that struggling for a cause affecting the collective body of people was the noblest act that people could undertake. and all these years since that supreme sacrifice in chicago, the idea has grown that it is through a constant reinforcing of courage and a clear understanding of contemporary realities that societies can move forward.
efficiency dividends from farm lending
if there has been a consistent pattern of increase in the disbursement and recovery of farm loan during past three years, last nine months in particular stand out for a spurt in the trend. what is of special import is that a qualitative improvement has also taken place in terms of speed and timeliness with which agri-credit reached the genuine farmers. in effect, it accounted for effective utilisation of loans, a sharp drop in default loan and the concomitant gains in productivity. view the page sports

ushering in the green century
a solar home system can provide uninterrupted fuel-free supply for 25 years with negligible maintenance cost (battery replacement cost after 5 years). though the initial installation cost is high, the tradeoff is the large savings afforded to the economy's power grid since each household with a pv solar home system is actually the owner of an individual pv power plant.

may day: spirit and reality
the origin of international labour day -- may day -- can be traced back to philadelphia in december 1869, where a group of nine tailors who called themselves "knights of labour" established a labour organisation. the knights of labour could successfully forge strong solidarity among the working classes all over the world by upholding its motto "an injury to one is the concern of all."

deciding climate change adaptation and mitigation measures
a very severe earthquake of the magnitude of 8.6 on the richter scale occurred in august 1950 with its epicenter close to the border of assam in india and tibet in china. this earthquake caused huge landslides in the himalayas, estimated at about 45 billion cubic meter. within a few years, most of the debris generated from the landslides entered into the brahmaputra river through numerous tributaries in assam. the fine fraction of sediment mainly consisting of silt and clay very quickly transported through the brahmaputra/jamuna river and deposited in the meghna estuary area. it moved through the river slowly like a sand wave and caused significant changes in river morphology. some recent research (by this writer) describes the responses of the rivers through widening and increasing of erosive capacity during the propagation of the sand wave. that was the main reason why the erosion along the jamuna and padma rivers was higher in the 1980s and 1990s than in the previous and later periods.
addressing gender concerns in adaptation discourse
it is widely acknowledged that the negative effects of climate change are likely to hit the poorest in the poorest countries hardest. in climate change discourse, attempts to link gender and climate change may seem rather far-fetched. there have been few publications to establish this linkage. most of the approaches toward tackling the threats focused on scientific and technological aspects of the problem, ignoring the social issue.

literary editor's note
this saturday we continue on with the writers block interpretations on beginnings.
bargain bin books: thrill of the find
this eminently sound advice was proclaimed by richard ford in his book a handbook for travellers in spain (1847). darkwood elaborates: “unless you are particularly agile, my recommendation is: if your eyes need massaging, then try rubbing them with somebody else's elbows instead.” the chapter on 'hostilities and personal security' cautions us as follows: “no amount of prowess shown at the fathers' egg-and-spoon race at the school sports day can prepare you to outrun a cheetah, for example.” well, current perception of what constitutes 'hostilities and personal security' and the ensuing terror - is more likely to present itself in the form of today's body search and tomorrow's body scan all in the name of war on terror. this purchase left me ca$6.99 out of pocket versus its original pricing at ca$24.95. view the page star health

the iranian nuclear conference
the nuclear security summit discussed the safety and security of nuclear materials, and preventing its proliferation to non-state actors who could use them for terrorist purposes. while the al qaeda was clearly identified, the washington summit made references to the iranians being the main problem. iran, a signatory of the non-proliferation treaty (npt), has been repeatedly condemned by the west for developing an illegal nuclear weapons program. the international community's concerns are accentuated by iran's documented state patronage of terror groups like the hamas and hezbollah. india cannot dismiss these fears due to its own problems with jihadis in the subcontinent. iran's linkage to pakistani rogue nuclear scientist, aq khan, has further added to indian concerns with the iranian nuclear program. the iranians have rejected these allegations. accusing countries opposing their nuclear ambitions as hypocritical and organizing summits “designed to humiliate people”; tehran launched its own nuclear summit titled “nuclear energy for all, nuclear weapons for none”. however, compared to the washington conference, many heads of state gave it a miss, with prime minister singh stating that india would only be represented at the diplomatic level, because of the last minute nature of the conference.
