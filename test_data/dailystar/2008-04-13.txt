noxious dhaka air
the pollution level of dhaka city's air is worsening at an alarming rate with varied types of toxic pollutants being released in the air regularly from different sources. exhaust fumes from faulty engines of motorised vehicles, especially diesel engines, remain the number one cause behind release of large amount of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide and lead particles. thus, one can clearly perceive the consequence in terms of air quality when the number of motorised vehicles keeps increasing by ten percent annually in the city alone. the constant increase of vehicles is also contributing to severe jam on the streets, which again causes burning of fuel in large amount in the stranded vehicles.
after the elections in nepal
for a nation yet to get acclimatised to substantive democracy, nepal appears to have been doing reasonably well for itself. the elections last thursday, for which votes are still being counted, drew as many as 60 per cent of the electorate to the polling stations. there have, of course, been instances of pre-election violence, but they have been minimal. the dire predictions earlier made by many about a disruption in the voting have been belied. and yet it becomes the responsibility of all parties taking part in the elections to ensure that the results are respected and upheld.
charting a developmental path for bangladesh
if one were to interrogate walt rostow's proposed theory of the stages of economic growth then the time to be taken by the developing countries in reaching stage of developed state would become indeterminate. this is because it stretches from pre-newtonian traditional stage through preconditions of take-off and take-off stages with expansion of new industries to the fourth stage of “drive to maturity” in which economies broaden their base with advanced technology and complex process and finally arrive at the stage of mass consumption with culture, politics and ethics as prerequisites of economic performance.

reality bites
it probably helps if you are coaching bangladesh to be both grimly realistic and cautiously optimistic. you must accept that defeat will, at present, mostly be inevitable, but you must also be able to draw from it some solace, something to hold on to. luckily for bangladesh, jamie siddons is able to do both.

iran's nuclear programme
i am writing with reference to point counterpoint: "forty-year old nuclear programme," by jamal ashraf (april 8).
economic "nationalism"
right at this moment our country and its policymakers need economic management on the basis of economic nationalism. let me clarify: food prices have gone up internationally. it's not an excuse for the present ctg but a reality. why don't we change our food habits, not for these " hidden hunger” days but for the years ahead. not only potato, which had a bumper production this year, but other cereals could be added to make it a balanced diet. we need publicity. btv can do that instead of sermonising the farmers on how to produce boro or how to protect potatoes. actually btv is run by taxpayers' money but they are not doing enough to promote national interests.
clinton nostalgia
the clintons have injected former president bill into the battle to such an extent that an insulting (yet not inaccurate) word -- billary --is back in political parlance. in fact, the clintons have played the bill card so belligerently that you would think bill is the candidate and hillary his spokesperson! obama was quite right in saying that sometimes he could not realize which candidate he was running against.

first yarn recovery plant
islam's report published on 2nd april in your pages on the commissioning of a swiss-bangla joint venture; the first plant in the country for recovering yarn from waste cotton and waste cloth. it is a worthwhile achievement, and the private sector investor deserves our congratulations for this innovative industry for recycling cotton and garment wastes. i believe this enterprise has a good potential in bangladesh and is an important import substitution for reducing the need for imported raw cotton and yarn.
food habits
it is time we should bring about substantial changes in our lifestyle with regard to food habits particularly amongst marginal and vulnerable groups. indeed, there has been a worldwide food grain and cereal shortage. global climate change has an adverse effect leading to sea level rise, increase in floods, cyclones, tornadoes, drought and loss of biodiversity. many factors including climatic changes resulted in unprecedented price escalation. we have witnessed over the last one or two years unprecedented political turmoil, flash floods and devastating effects of cyclone sidr resulting in totally chaotic consumer market scenario. misdistribution of fertiliser and/or pesticides, too much profiteering by the middlemen and increased cost of transportation have certainly contributed to the unaffordable price of rice, ata and edible oil.
dual citizenship
it is wonderful news, published in your daily and issued by the foreign ministry on 24 march, that british passport holder bangladeshis from now on will retain their bangladeshi citizenship automatically under a new rule of the ministry of home affairs. this rule will scrap the previous notification, circulars, orders or instructions of the government.
price spiral and students
price spiral has recently become one of the burning issues. although it is a global problem, bangladesh is experiencing this acutely. the prices are soaring up day by day. the poor and middle class families cannot afford to manage two square meals.
plight of a public library
the divisional public library of chittagong is beset with many problems. to begin with, the library is housed in a building that was partially damaged by an earthquake-- the cracks on walls are still visible. then the lighting of the reading rooms is less than adequate. as evening creeps in, the readers have no choice but to read in dimly-lit halls. the corridors have bad smell as the toilets are not cleaned properly.
set examples
our country is facing many problems of which three appear most pressing. these are food crisis, shortage of power and financial crunch. the caretaker government is trying many options including disbursing valuable advices, of course free of cost! people demand something concrete. to alleviate the food crisis it is suggested that we change our food habit, take more potatoes to supplement rice. can't we set some examples here? we may serve potato made items in our government functions, we may urge government officials to take their lunch made from potato and other vegetables. those institutions getting government subsidies in food items may take 50% potato in place of rice or ata. the guest control law may be stringently followed to stop extravagant use of food items.
top two
a local bengali daily has carried a news item that the two leaders in jail will have to agree to “three conditions” to get released from jail. i have no intention to repeat the conditions mentioned, but the conditions look like an arbitrary formula of the government to pave the way for controlled democracy. i have doubt that these would be acceptable to the two leaders or to their party cadres. these conditions seem to be a hard line approach of the government, but the scope of negotiation cannot still be ruled out, hopefully. view the page international

one china policy and olympic 2008
china is, indeed, a great country, with 5000 years of recorded history. ancient china was the centre of world civilisation, and the seat of knowledge, wisdom and culture for millennia. even our prophet muhamamd 1500 years ago instructed people to travel to china to seek knowledge. china, especially in recent decades, has achieved tremendous progress and development in all spheres of national life. it has turned out to be the most vibrant nation, a great economic powerhouse, a nation most confident and determined, and is unabatedly surging forward. china watchers appreciate that, with the present pace of development, by 2030 it will be the largest economy and greatest economic power, overtaking us. this phenomenal development of china was achieved through peace, socio-political stability and harmony. it has very high maturity, prudence and vision.
