al warning to errant mps and bcl elements
the top echelon of the awami league leadership has warned party lawmakers and activists of the chhatra league that action will be taken against them if they indulge in corruption and other irregularities. ruling party members of the jatiya sangsad have been served notice to the effect that if they stray from the right path, they should not expect the party's nominations at the next general election. they have been asked to stop distributing test relief and government relief-related wheat and instead deal with issues of immediate public concern. such a position must now move on to the next step. it is not enough to say that errant mps will not get party nominations in future. what the government must do is go after them right away if it believes they have been indulging in corruption. surely the nation does not relish the thought of such corruption going on unchecked and unpunished till the next election!

sustainable population
this crucial matter needs to be seriously taken up. the government must have pragmatic plans and actions to contain the population explosion. earlier, a significant population control programme was successfully implemented with total commitment and hard work and personal supervision by the (late) dr. ibrahim, founder of diabetic association of bangladesh, as the then, health and population planning adviser under zia's military rule in the 1970s. something like that is needed now.
cng price
the government is thinking of doubling the present price of cng. if the decision is implemented it would be extremely detrimental to environment of dhaka metropolitan city as well as a bad sign for investors. environmentally, cng is known as a cleaner fuel. in order to save dhaka metropolitan city from the menace of environmental degradation, cng was commercially introduced in 2001.the job was not easy. it took rpgcl, a company of petrobangla, about 20 years of relentless efforts to popularize cng in the country. a lot of concessions like low price of cng as an automobile fuel, 100% duty free import of equipment of cng stations, allotment of government land etc were given by the government to attract private investors in this sector which was hitherto controlled by the government. the sector grew at a faster rate with the active participation of private investors. more than one billion dollars of investment has been in the sector which is now established on a sound footing. the result is a cleaner environment of dhaka city which we could not imagine had not cng been introduced as an automotive fuel. the economic benefit was also tremendous. with the consumption of about only 100 mmcf of gas per day as cng in the automobiles(which is only 5% of total gas consumption in the country) more than 1 billion dollar worth of foreign exchange is being saved every year in terms reduction of import of liquid hydrocarbon fuel because of use of cng. our government is also conscious about environment and it is hard to believe that they will take any decision which will encourage people to go back to use of liquid fuels to run automotive vehicles at the cost of such a hard earned cleaner environment of dhaka city.
polybags & environment
in 2002, the government banned the production and use of polybags in our country. unfortunately, polybags are being widely used again everywhere. now, we are using a huge amount of polybgas daily and then throwing those into drains. polybags block the flow of drain water. so, the drainage systems of our big city like dhaka and chittagong are blocked in the rainy season due to polybags. polybags are also a threat to our environment and agriculture.
garment workers
where is the conscience of the entire nation? when a factory owner spends thirty to forty thousand taka for a dinner for his family and friends (i have witnessed that in bangladesh), how can he refuse to pay a mere tk 3,000 for an entire month of 12 hours workdays for a worker? we have become as bad as the pakistani oppressors.
undemocratic provision
after winning independence from west pakistan in 1971, we started our democratic journey. our constitutional journey started on 4 november 1972. the journey continued based on the rule of law, fundamental rights, personal liberty, etc before the 4th amendment was made in the constitution. our constitution followed the british constitution and it is known to us that all developed countries such as uk, the usa, japan framed their constitution based on the rule of law, fundamental rights and liberty.
mp sued
the daily star carried an editorial on 11 july under the headline "an mp sued by police sergeant'. the paper called it 'unprecedented' maybe, but fully justified'. the editorial was concluded saying that "if the case that has been lodged against the mp is allowed to thrown off course, before producing a conclusive outcome, then an invaluable opportunity of asserting the supremacy of law will be lost. that will be drawing a big blank."
speculation
just a joke. do not take it as any political story. just assume that the wc final was between bangladesh and spain. can you imagine any ramification of that ? yes, i can. the bangladesh team and its management would have boycotted the ceremony in protest of the "doubtful off side goal" awarded to spain. further action could even be called for a dawn to dusk "hartal' in bangladesh to mark a national protest against the "doubtful off side goal". i am sure the "hartal" could be a total success in peaceful atmosphere without any picketing, intimidation and threat, an usual game before and during political hartal.
women leaders
is bangladesh under a divine political curse (since its birth in 1971)? the young nation is being denied the correct political leadership at the national level (no political consensus).
expulsion of bhuiyan
the condition of expelled secretary general of bnp, abdul mannan bhuiyan is critical. he is on life support at square hospital after his return from singapore and kept in the icu in “unconscious and breathlessness condition”. he is in fact in a coma and provided with artificial life support. now he is not even in a condition to breathe naturally. he could not be served with chemotherapy due to such health condition.
eve teasing in khulna
during the summer vacation of my college, i had to take my son to his school for some days and during his school hours i used to wait a park named 'bandhan' situated just beside the khulna passport office and near the 'morning bell school' where my son is enrolled. when i used to wait in that park, i witnessed what eve teasing is and how many kinds it has.
stop eve teasing
it is a matter of great regret that the anti-social activities are going beyond control. especially, there has been a sharp increase in eve teasing. already, the authorities have taken some steps to contain it , but those are not enough. so, the government should think in terms of tough action against eve teasers.
veil and islam
to say something about the veil system of islam we should firstly know where it is mentioned and know in detail about it. the holy quran speaks about the veil for women in sura al-noon, verse 31, which is, in a nutshell-- all body should be covered, the only parts which can be seen are wrist of the hands and face, even face can be covered if anybody wants, though it is not mandatory. and the reason of the veil for women is mentioned in the holy quran in sura ahzab, in the verse no 59, where allah, who knows best which things will be best for human being, says that, it, the veil, will protect them from being molested. veil is also mentioned in the christian scripture, hindu scripture, and many other religious scriptures.
dangerous chemicals
recent newspaper reports have shown how dangerous chemicals are being used extensively to ripen various types of local and imported "fruits". people are taking these fruits every day all over the country and are contracting deadly diseases. unfortunately, the authorities have not taken any tough action but have allowed the culprits to get away lightly.
vawal express
the vawal express starts from kamalapur railway station at 11:00 pm for dewanganj via mymensingh and jamalpur town. late running of this train has become a regular feature nowadays. many service holders go to melanda, islampur and dewanganj upazila by this train. the train becomes over crowded every day. the helpless passengers complete their journey with great difficulty. the most problematic thing is that the passengers who collect tickets have to travel without seat. no tc or tte are seen in the train. if they do their duty the passengers with tickets could make their journey with comfort. on the other hand, the government could get a lot of revenue from ticket selling.
the fullness of a patriot
it was a pleasure to read syed badrul ahsan's piece on dr. kamal hossain (july 14). arguably, bangladesh has never produced an internationally reputed lawyer of hossain's calibre in contemporary times. while i have never had much sympathy for the awami league's philosophy, the former foreign minister of ours is one awami league stalwart whose scholarship, cosmopolitanism, and erudition set him in a class apart.
save bangshi
the river bangshi , situated in savar and dhamrai, plays an important role for the areas concerned. many people depend on this river for their livelihood. but it is a matter of great regret that this river is being polluted by toxic industrial waste. this poisonous water, which emerges from garment factories, is a serious threat to this river. the river's water has turned blackish.
symbols of islam
at present due to the virulent propaganda of international media against islam, the religion of peace and its symbols are considered as threatening by some ignorant people who do not know about the beauty of islam. i'm discussing just two symbols out of many--- beard and cap. these two are very important symbols by which one can easily identify a muslim. but now if anybody has a beard and wears a cap can't get a good job in international organisations even in bangladesh, in spite of its being a muslim majority country.
good decision
first of all, i would congratulate the prime minister for taking the decision to stop private practice of the government doctors in private clinics. this is a good step which will play a vital role in improving medicare services in the country. view the page international
