bonsai dream
at dusk, after a light shower, the bonsais tremble in the breeze. when night deepens along with the rain, their tiny leaves and branches shake feverishly as if in a storm. from the deep recesses of their pygmy bodies cracklings could be heard, as if the plants were stretching their limbs. atiq watches as the tiny plants become enormous in size, grow in height, shoot up four- five storeys to almost touch the sky. at such times a greenish darkness radiates from their thick stems, their bulbous leaves and branches and gushes forth in waves to get hold of atiq. his sleep gone, atiq gropes for the torch beneath his pillow. these days he has grown accustomed to it. he no longer thinks it as a nightmare. he knows what the bonsais are capable of.

india's endeavour for space security asset
the evolution of information technology has metamorphosed the very dynamics of contemporary warfare. in the current scenario, national security not only relies on the modernization of armed forces, cutting-edge defence technology and innovative policies, but also on elusive assets like communication and information. there is a transition, from the race of arms, nuclear weapons, weapons of mass destruction (wmds), towards the race of information dominance. the enhanced use of information, expeditious chrysalis of microcomputers, information technologies and cyberspace has changed the very face of war and emerged as a new challenge for national security. the avidity to acquire more information and intelligence to counter and design future warfare puts an intense demand on space assets. view the page star books review
of flowing times, of great men
for anybody who loves bangladesh, it is a singular pleasure to write a few lines in appreciation of this splendid autobiographical venture from a well-known civil servant of the people's republic of bangladesh. it is infinitely more so for a person like me, who has been a close friend of the author, nurul huq, for the last half-a-century. he has always astounded me and his enormous circle of friends with his phenomenal memory which enables him to remember minute details of events long past. but even then, i was not prepared for the range and beauty of this wonderful journey down memory lane, describing not just the trials and tribulations of the emerging muslim middle class of bengal. at the same time, the work is a very honest and dispassionate chronicle of the struggles, successes and failures of the emerging nation state called bangladesh.
state of the original people
small ethnic groups of bangladesh ---a mapping exercise retains the history and culture of ethnic people who constitute an integral part of our population. the historic, linguistic, cultural and social attributes of our ethnic people remain latent in the form of cds to unfold before us. social and political scientiss may find rich spicy materials in this seemingly small book. the ethnic groups of bangladesh have enriched our traditional culture and participated in the freedom movement, though these facts have not been widely circulated or known. this book bears the testimony to those realities. the writer has gone to pains to record them for us. this study proceeds with three objectives --- finding out the exact number of small ethic groups; estimating their size and identifying their locations; and gathering selected information on the demographic , educational and socio-economic status of these groups. though the study deals with these basic parameters, it rather tends to tilt toward education.
