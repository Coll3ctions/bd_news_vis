fatah, hamas come together
it is certainly the best piece of news palestinians have had in a long time. the willingness on the part of fatah and hamas to come together in the interest of unity holds forth, even though it has been late in coming, the imperatives before the palestinians. in these past few years especially, the concept of a free state of palestine has repeatedly been subjected to assaults by israel and, ironically, by the disunity of the palestinian leadership itself. the kind of democratic politics which a few years ago seemed promising for the region simply went into reverse when an elected hamas government was dismissed. in 2007, the seizure of political control in gaza by hamas, with fatah retaining authority in the rest of palestinian territory, only darkened an already murky situation.

e-textbooks and needy students
habib's center-piece report on the matter in your issue of 23 april is another example of discrimination against the poor. in this case; poor students will suffer, who needs free textbooks; whereas the rich students can access it through web site! despite the free access to the web site, one has to pay for having computer facilities, printer, and paper for printing. the statement that "any one can download the contents for free and also read these on mobile phones"; is all meant for the better off. for the poor students, the good news was in the last line of the report; which stated: about 23.22 crore free text books were distributed among 2.22 crore primary and secondary students in the first week of january this year!
only for natural resources
we have learnt from media that nato wants more war planes from its member countries. even, the anti-gaddafi protesters also seek more air strike from nato to oust gaddafi. but we see there is a clear division among the member countries regarding the method of enforcing no-fly zone over libya. germany, belgium and turkey oppose attacking libya. a news item, published in the hindu of 15 april 2011, surprised us; it says, russia has finalized a deal with nato to supply two dozens combat helicopters. t nato is certainly strengthened by this deal. if nato makes libya operation lengthy on any pretext the objective of super powers will be clear, - occupy the natural resources of libya.

national frog month!
in the united states, april is being observed as the “national frog month”. in the world of make-believe, kissing a frog could turn him into a prince. but in real life, the case is different. touching frogs by human can cause serious harm to humans as well as to the frogs; both may get killed! frogs can transmit diseases. they can give humans tapeworm cysts and salmonella poisoning, said jeremy goodman, director of the turtle back zoo in west orange, new jersey. he further cautioned that both can cause serious complications if not treated immediately. in fact, toads are also frogs. there are some differences in their body structure. frogs like environments that are moister while toads prefer dry places to live. toads have poison glands behind their eyes. frogs helps in controlling harmful insects in the crop fields. they are used as one of the tools in integrated pest management (ipm) system which is environment friendly. we should also take proper care of them.
save the women
sheikh hasina wants to show that she is working for the women of bangladesh by introducing new women policy. she also reiterated that she keeps faith in allah. do we need any special policy for women if we believe in allah? does islam support any prostitution? but in bangladesh, innocent girls and women are increasing significantly in the prostitutions and a few are facing the same when they are going abroad for working there. save the girls and women working in the prostitutions and give them normal life. create congenial atmosphere for girls and women free from eve teasing, dowry, physical and mental torture in their in-laws houses.
empower the acc
this is in response to news that appeared in the english daily which states that the indian prime minister monmohan singh is going to introduce a bill on anti-graft in the next sessions of the parliament in the backdrop of growing public anger and dissent against rampant corruption committed by the ministers, bureaucrats and corporate bosses in india. to intensify the movement a 73 year old social activist went on hunger strike until death, to enact an anti-graft law that drew huge public attention and cause furor all over india and forced the prime minister to concede to the demand. we are also extremely frustrated with the rising corruptions in all levels of the society and demand that our government give unlimited powers to the acc to process and punish the offenders disregarding their position and status in the society.
convocation day can never be sad
i am writing in response to the letter titled “a sad day at nsu” published on 25 april. it's regrettable that despite being educated some people do not know how to respect senior citizens. the writer has regarded the elderly president of bangladesh as “mr. walking dead”, which apparently reveals that he outrageously lacks general sense of respect. an identical tone of dishonor embodies the writer's shameless renaming of his sister's “graduation day” as the “silly hat day”. obviously, the writer is not matured enough to understand the significance of the uniquely shaped convocation “mortarboard” that symbolizes academia and superior knowledge. the writer must also be aware that convocations in many internationally renowned universities are not held at air-conditioned auditoriums. like nsu, many world-class universities arrange convocations in their respective campus playgrounds. convocation can never be a sad day for those who graduate with a widely recognized degree after years of arduous hard work.
facebook hitch
a student of duet has been suspended for making derogatory remarks about the pm's family on facebook (p-20, tds, 22.04.2011). the report seemingly attempted to further justify the decision by stating that the student was a shibir member. he is now in hiding. punishing the act is nevertheless alarming - because it's contrary to the concept of freedom of speech. everyone reserves the right to dislike, and/or voice such disapproval of, any family - a right protected by our constitution. whatever happened to ''i may disagree with what you say, but i'll defend till death your right to say it''? the honorable pm and the al need to watch out because such fanatic allegiance cannot be easily distanced or disowned. also, the probe committee, representing an educated forum, should learn to respect student's opinions - regardless of the latter's political affiliations or poor judgment.
truth is loved
"truth is bitter"- this is an arabic proverb. another adage adds, "truth saves and lie ruins." hazrat abu bakar (r.), the first caliph of islam, is rewarded with the title 'siddik' only for his truthfulness. francis bacon, an english litterateur, in his famous essay 'of truth' nicely says, ''the inquiry of truth, which is the love-making or wooing of it, the knowledge of truth, which is the presence of it, and the belief of truth, which is the enjoying of it, is the sovereign good of human nature." each of our tasks should, therefore, be on the basis of the truth. we have to keep in mind that a liar is hated and rejected everywhere and, on the contrary, a person with truth is always loved and accepted by all.
for a main gate at du
if you want to enter into a house, shop or into a small or big institution then you have to cross a gate. in almost all cases you find a sign-board describing its identity. everybody try to beautify gates and sign-board more than inside and also spend much in it. but it's surprisingly true that the country's oldest and famous institution university of dhaka has no gates at all. although it has some sign-board at the entrance but these are so old and faded colored that is hardly possible to see. as a result, one can pass over the university from shahbag to dhaka medical college he/she will not understand that he/she visited the university. i am requesting the authority for the establishment of a du main gate in shahbag entrance. that may be an advertisement and indicator for the new comer.
upgrade our hospitals
our politicians do not rely on the health service provided by the local hospitals in bangladesh. despite making emotional statements in public and encouraging people towards patriotism; the party leaders (including ruling and opposition) would often go abroad for medical treatment to waste money. their medical expenditure per year is in million dollars, which is unimaginable for a country like ours. they are wasting tax payers' money and flying abroad for simple illness. will you see this in our neighbouring country? we have some good private and government hospitals that are providing up to the mark health service. instead of going abroad, try to modernize these hospitals with expert workforce and new upgraded equipments. this will help the common people and they will be blessed by these modern treatments. it's high time, think about your country first and then for yourself.

prime minister sheikh hasina opened online version of textbooks of primary and secondary education under a project access to information (a2i) project of the pm's office last sunday. but all the books were already in the internet in pdf format earlier. the same books have been aired in different format. it would be useful if we have teachers' guide in the internet i.e. how to teach each of the topics; some worksheets; video clips of some topics by professional teachers; supplementary materials etc.
stop bsf killings
from april 19, 2011 issues of different newspapers, we learned that a bangladeshi cattle trader was killed and another was wounded when indian border security force opened fire on them in gazipur frontiers in satkhira on april 18, 2011. bsf is routinely killing bangladeshis; it seems it has become their favorite past time and an opportunity to practice their marksmanship on innocent bangladeshis. according to odhikar, the border security force killed 907 people of bangladesh between january 1, 2000 and march 31, 2011. we are outraged and protest this action vehemently. prime minister sheikh hasina considers india to be a friend of bangladesh, but is this how a friend acts? the government must take immediate steps to prevent further loss of lives of bangladeshis in hands of the trigger-happy bsf.
