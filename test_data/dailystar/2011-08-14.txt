a shameful performance!
bangladesh cricket team's degrading performance against zimbabwe is something the whole nation is talking about. our captain and vice captain are always having problems with the team management and when it comes to leading the team i think they have fail miserably. this defeat will pose a serious threat to bangladesh's test status and i think the day is not far away when our team will lose their test status. how could they lose so badly to the weakest team of the world? i think our captain and vice captain should learn how to behave properly with the team management.
let's not overeat
as a way to keep the prices of the foodstuffs under control, the commerce minister has asked people to eat less. his remark has drawn severe criticism from every corner. in fact, he is right; only he has chosen the wrong words to express his idea. instead of suggesting the people to eat less, he should have suggested them not to overeat. though allah has asked the muslims to be moderate in having their foods during the month of ramadan, people of bangladesh increase their food intake almost double during this month, defying allah's command. this practice increases the demand of the foodstuffs in the market in this month and our greedy businessmen increase the prices of the food items. in fact, they wait impatiently eleven months for the month of ramadan to come so that they can flay the consumers. people of bangladesh need to change their food habit during ramadan to teach the unscrupulous businessmen a lesson.
london riots
the london riots and looting this weekend were among the worst civil disturbances britain has seen in a quarter century. some blamed government spending cuts and tough austerity measures for sowing unrest and weakening police.
traffic jam
nowadays traffic jam has become intolerable in our beloved dhaka city. although government has taken many steps to bring it on an acceptable level but due to ineffectiveness and lack of monitoring system those are not working properly. as a result, we have to lose our valuable working hours as well as automobile's costly fuel every day. although a modern city should have 25% of its total area for road uses but unfortunately in our capital city we have only 7% area for roads. i think this is the main reason behind the traffic jam in dhaka city.
the sinister syndicate
only one thing that is falling in price in bangladesh is the share price because some people on the corridor of power control the bourse to their advantage at the cost of the teeming investors. a quite opposite scenario is prevailing in the commodity market where the prices are soaring thanks to a syndicate of top 10 businessmen.
our responsibility towards the poor
a heart-rending photograph was published in the daily star on august 4, 2011 captioned "her mother can only afford…" thanks to rashed shumon and the daily star for publishing it. the sad picture depicts the pathetic condition of a section of our society. is it not enough to stir our conscience to come forward to relieving the distress of the suffering people? there are thousands of shahanaz begum in our society gasping for help. allah has created man as the best of all creation. so, men must look upon others with sympathy and kindness. otherwise allah will not forgive us.
norway's ambassador on israel
although his comment received bitter criticism from the pro-israeli camps but i think the comment made by the norway's ambassador to israel is logical and appropriate in the present context.
we want an end to it
in bangladesh, police is the most inefficient among all. to hide their inefficiency they want to show people that they are not inactive. after all, they're doing something. we witnessed abdul kadar being tortured by cops; before him there was limon. after kadar there will be another one added to this victims' list, and so on.
bangabandhu would never have approved it
when people came to know of the government's plan to set up a nuclear power plant, they protested vehemently and urged the government to refrain from this suicidal step because it may not be guaranteed one hundred percent safe and if something goes wrong it would be disastrous. we know what a havoc had been wrought in russia and japan by the accident in nuclear power plants, our country would be more prone to such accidents because our maintenance is very poor.
discount offers
in the past we have seen that the business organisations offer discounts on their products on various occasions. but now they are searching for occasions to offer discounts. this continuous discount on products of some organisations creates huge confusion among the customers about the quality of their products. one may think that they are giving discounts because the products are of low quality. so, there is a chance of losing customers' trust which the companies should remember, and the customers may also shift to other brands. so the business organizations should inform their customers clearly about the cause of their discount offer.

tareque masud . . . history's storyteller
you could not help being arrested by tareque masud's gaze. there was always a shine to the eyes, and it came with that perpetual smile which could only draw people to him. there was every reason for him to be aloof, to stay away from the madding crowd. in a social ambience where we somehow expect celebrities to confine themselves to the other side of the fence, to bask in their glory, tareque masud refused to be a celebrity, was a refreshing departure. you did not have to walk up to him to exchange a hello or to tell him what a great filmmaker he was. much to your surprise, sometimes to consternation, it was he who would stride toward you, with that luminosity of a smile all over his handsome features, to greet you.
tributes pour in
tareque masud, bangladesh's legendary film maker whose contributions to renewing local and global interest in bangladesh's history through his documentaries, indeed through his consistent efforts to keep the spirit of the nation alive, has seen his life end on an unexpected, tragic note.
i remember tareque…..
it is hard to be precise about the date when we first met. but i know where and how we met. it was in september 1986 i joined the german cultural center (goethe institute) dhaka as programme officer. here i met the most talented minds of the country. since the goethe institute is renowned for its cultural activities including promotion of art and culture and imparting lessons on music, theatre and film making, the place would be a point of congregation of great minds in art, culture and literature. it was a great feeling to be in the company of budding theatre activists, actors, musicians and of course passionate film makers.

should great be taken out from britain?
riots in london and in other cities there, in recent months and specially last week, have brought many to realise that the word "great" may not after all be an appropriate prefix now to use before britain. the country seems to be in a downward slide. the ideals on which it built itself up to be great are fast disappearing. an indifferent political class in that country had turned their back on the people.
pledges, mps and jatiya sangshad (js)
politics in bangladesh is again taking an ugly turn and people are apprehending that if non cooperation between the government and opposition persists, we may be constrained to deal with an insurmountable and unsavory situation.
moving forward with ship breaking
ship breaking is the process of dismantling old ship to recover steel scrap and other materials. this industry began in bangladesh in 1960, when a violent storm left a giant cargo ship and beached near sea shore of fauzdarhat at chittagong. in 1974, al abbas, a salvaged pakistan navy vessel, which was sunk during liberation war, was scrapped by karnafully metal works and since then commercial ship-breaking began in bangladesh. finally in the year 1984, bangladesh appeared as a major ship breaking nation in the world.
the 'indigenous' question and revisiting bengal's history
foreign minister dipu moni recently reiterated her governments firm "resolve" that the indigenous peoples living in the country, especially those living in the chittagong hill tracts (cht), should be referred to as "ethnic minorities" and not "indigenous."
the chemistry of giving
life in washington can be a real grind, even for a retired person like me. the day simply evaporates between running household errands and performing mundane chores. however, the city does offer more fulfilling opportunities like enjoying a rare art display at the smithsonian's sackler museum or attending an interesting concert at the kennedy center, or participating in community activities.
