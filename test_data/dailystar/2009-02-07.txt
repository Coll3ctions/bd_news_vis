satellite remote sensing : efficient tool for fisheries development
remote sensing is the process of sensing and measuring objects from a distance without physical contact with them. satellite remote sensing observation systems brought with it the capability to synoptically survey vast areas in unprecedented detail. it appears feasible to use satellite sensors to measure selected parameters and then to use these measurements to predict the distribution and abundance of fisheries resources. remote sensing technique can provide considerable information at a minimal cost and time for this type of study. this technique can be used reliably and effectively to map location, size, quality of wetlands and some aspects of habitat. bangladesh space research and remote sensing (sparrso) has developed remote sensing techniques effectively and efficiently to locate, identify and quantify our inland, coastal and marine fisheries resources habitat. some of the works accomplished by sparrso are as the following: view the page literature

south asian counter-terrorism task force
the mumbai terrorist attacks of 26/11 and its political fallout on indo-pak relations were yet another harsh reminder of some disconcerting realities about south asia. it pointed out that south asia remains one of the most vulnerable regions for terror attacks and trans-national security breaches. that the danger which terrorism poses within and among the countries of south asia has every potential to stymie political goodwill earned through bilateral and regional initiatives such as saarc or bimstec. that despite having emerged as the epicentre of the us led global 'war on terror', south asia's success in hunting down the 'terrorists' or their 'masterminds' have been less than enviable. that terrorism in south asia is trans-national in nature and necessitates a regional approach, no matter how difficult it may seem to achieve, given the political tension and mistrust among countries in the region. it is high time that countries in south asia cease to view terrorism as their neighbour's problem, set aside the culture of recriminating neighbours to the detriment of regional cooperation and crack down on terrorism as a common security challenge.

although india's minister for external affairs, pranab mukherjee's visit on 9th february, has been called a “goodwill” one, the visit is seen as important for two reasons: it will be the first visit of an indian senior minister after awami league-led government's assumption of office, and secondly he is currently discharging additional responsibilities in the absence of the indian prime minister dr. singh. view the page star books review
poetry and prose blending in fashion . . .
beginning from december, february and then march, we cannot come out of memories, still fresh, of the liberation war. february reminds us of the young men who laid down their lives to make bangla the 'rashthro bhasha'. this was the threshold of the liberation war and writing across borders encloses such reminiscences. in this month, st.valentine avowed that love is the most beautiful thing that could happen to a person. such episodes are accommodated too.
only free men can laugh . . . and love
kreetadasher hashi is shaukat osman's masterpiece dedicated to a.k.m.ahsan, civil servant, poet sanaul huq, and harihar juglashu. more significant is abdul bari warsi who supported the publication of this work. there are remembrances of atrocities committed during the rule of ayub khan, the period referred to in osman's work.
the glow in a poet's soul
it is indeed a pleasure to write on the works of a poet whose heart cries out for the distressed. saiful bari's tribute to the poor is extremely pure and high, and in some of the poems i felt the tribute could be turned into deep love as well. one is here reminded of rabindranath tagore, whose songs of the puja parba are similar to the love songs of the prem parba in geetabitan . perhaps all love starts with respect, with very strong love ending in puja or devotion. love for a physical being turns into love for god, for llah, for christ or for the prabhu in tagore music.
paradox of the creator and the created
out of a brothel, perfumed desirably and trailing a mysterious bloodline, an 'overly pretty' traveller reaches the magnificent court of mughal emperor akbar. despite his foolish choice to wear a coat of coloured leather lozenges in the heat of fatehpur sikri, the traveller wittily introduces himself as 'mogor dell'amore', the mughal of love. as akbar falls prey to his silvered tongue, the yellow-haired traveller starts to relate a story of love which can 'make his fortune or else cost him his life.'
