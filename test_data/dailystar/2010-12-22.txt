the continuing plight of the sailors
the state of uncertainty over the fate of the crew of mv jahan moni continues. there is little sign of any progress having been made where freeing the crew, now captive at the hands of somali pirates, is concerned. since december 5, when the 26 bangladeshis aboard the vessel were seized off the coast of somalia, not much headway has been made in the matter of resolving the crisis. it appears that the government has either been playing a rather cautious role or is inclined to think that the problem will somehow sort itself out. to be sure, the authorities have given it out that they are trying out every means possible to free the captives, among whom is the wife of a member of the crew. that has not been enough. and judging by the result as also the feelings of the families of the captive sailors, there is a clear need for the bangladesh government to go into high gear in the matter of bringing the crew as well as the ship back home in all safety.
