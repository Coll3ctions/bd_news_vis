the spirit of ekushey
fifty eight years ago, a band of young men made the supreme sacrifice of laying down their lives in the defence of our mother tongue bangla. and they did so in the full knowledge that theirs was a death that would only harden the resolve of the entire bengali nation in its struggle to be heard and to be accorded a place of dignity in the structure of the state. in other words, the struggle for bangla in pakistan was but the first manifestation of the general feeling in us that if we meant to live and thrive in self-esteem, we would need to keep eternal vigilance and thwart all the insidious moves that would be made to undermine our cultural heritage, indeed our historical calling as a society.

observing ekushey in its real spirit
this will be the 58th occasion on which bengalees everywhere will observe february 21 as the immortal language martyrs' day. the movement that the students of dhaka university and other educational institutions launched, in defiance of the draconian laws imposed by the then-pakistani rulers to press home their demands to establish the status of bengali as the state language, have all found their due place in the pages of history. we are all proud that the day has, by now, earned global recognition as the international mother language day.
international mother language day
more than a decade ago, the 30th session of the unesco general conference unanimously adopted a resolution tabled by bangladesh and cosponsored by 28 countries, proclaiming february 21 as international mother language day. it is a matter of pride and glory for the nation that our immortal "amar ekushey" is now also observed all over the world. on this day, people in 185 countries promise to preserve their mother languages, like our immortal language martyrs had done nearly six decades ago. what a befitting tribute to our martyrs! view the page sports

weekly currency roundup
feb 14-feb 18, 2010
international markets
the dollar continued on its bull run this week, with the euro having slid to a nine-month low hit earlier this week. the dollar edged close to a seven-month high against a basket of currencies on thursday after minutes showed us federal reserve policymakers had discussed strategies for withdrawing monetary stimulus. analysts said there were concerns that if countries such as greece implement the harsh fiscal measures needed to cut their debt this will weigh on euro zone growth and mean the european central bank will be slower to tighten monetary policy. fed minutes on wednesday supported the dollar, revealing several policymakers want to begin selling securities relatively soon as the us economy finds a footing. strong us data on wednesday also lifted the dollar, with figures showing us housing starts rose to a six-month high in january and industrial output increased solidly. greek prime minister george papandreou said on wednesday his debt-stricken country was not seeking european taxpayers' money but needed a breathing space to cut its budget deficit and borrow "on normal conditions". commodity-related currencies came under pressure after the international monetary fund said it planned to sell more gold in the market. the imf said it would begin phased open-market sales of the remaining 191.3 tonnes of gold it plans to sell under a programme launched last year to raise new resources for lending. view the page metropolitan

chaotic politics
it is getting clearer every day that the two mainstream political parties are locked in mudslinging and spreading rumours never supported by facts.
save garment industries
in rising to the challenge today, the path we follow must necessarily be a different one. besides boosting investment in garments, we need to make more efficient use of manpower, chemical inputs and natural resources, and focus more on the needs of small stakeholders. the textile and garments sectors achieved foreign currency investment to the tune of $ 126.36 million in 2008 and also more than that in 2009. but there is lack of discipline among the workers. they are not happy with the treatment meted out to them by the management.
traffic jam
traffic jam is one of the most awe-inspiring problems of dhaka city. the situation is deteriorating day by day. nowadays we have to spend 2-3 hours to travel two kilometres. if this terrible situation continues, in near future, no option will remain open, other than walking on foot.
should we continue this way?
bravo, to my friend mr rahat if nothing else, one must give him full marks for his consistency at being inconsistent on the question of banning rickshaws from dhaka immediately (ds 20 nov)!!! a few days ago mr chisti of lalmatia had voiced something similar and i have already sent off the rebuttal to ds. if that letter is printed before this, mr rahat should find most of the answers, if at all he is looking for an answer for our jams. also he can refer to my summary of the findings of the authoritative buet/jica traffic workshop, and transparency int. article “facts and figures” already printed in the ds.
learn from mahatma gandhi
when mahatma gandhi launched his non-violent movement to end the british colonial rule in india, he made it clear why he rejected all calls for leading a violent freedom struggle: "if indians take up guns to kill the british, given india's great religious and ethnic divisions, they would still be using the same guns to kill each other long after the british had gone. if india makes violence her creed, i will not care to live in india."
book fair
with due respect to the valiant martyrs of the '52 language movement, i strongly feel that the venue of the ekushey boi mela should be shifted to agargaon at the site of trade fair. the bookstalls as well as the number of visitors have multiplied manifold. there is a mad rush almost every day. the calm, serene ambience usually associated with the boi mela is absolutely lacking.
sports and war
did you know that the nicaragua-el salvador war, in which 20,000 people were killed, started over a football game? in fact, ernest hemingway, the world famous writer, who spent so much of his time in latin america and spain, said you could eliminate most latin american wars and their causes by simply banning football or soccer. those games get them so worked up into a frenzy against each other that nothing but a total all-out war can truly satisfy the spirit of it.
ministers' performance
the ds carried a news report on the performance of ministers. i think it is good to have some routine and regular reporting on half yearly basis. a group of different media experts can be pulled together for the purpose. media's perception should cover the performance of the ministers and members of the parliament, both treasury and opposition. the only aspect i would ask for inclusion is popular perception, positive or negative, in the media study report.
life
the victor in sunday's super bowl was not limited to the new orleans saints but to “life” thanks to the game's “pro-life” tv advertisement featuring heisman trophy winner tim tebow of the florida gators. it is both refreshing and encouraging to see top athletes living up to their great responsibility of being authentic role models for the many young people who look up to them.
road accidents
road accidents have become a common phenomenon nowadays. despite the government's relentless efforts to bring back traffic congestion under control, there is no improvement in the situation. a few months back, the government had introduced automated-traffic signalling. traffic sergeants were also employed at critical intersections along with the three-lane system but the condition is still worsening. view the page international
