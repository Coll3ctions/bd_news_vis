the conflict between russia and georgia
the american demand for a withdrawal of russian troops from georgia is but the latest in a conflict that threatens to destabilise the region. the determined manner in which russian forces have pounded away at georgian positions in and around the breakaway republic of ossetia have resulted not only in a serious loss of innocent lives but also in huge damage to georgian infrastructure. not even the capital tbilisi has been spared; and despite the brave claims by the georgian authorities that they have been inflicting blows on the russians, the bigger truth is that moscow's superior firepower may now have caused a situation where georgia could collapse unless a cessation of hostilities comes about soon.
politics cannot but be local

barisal election mystery
barisal, the venice of bengal , had some mysterious anecdotes since long. but now the city mayor's election under strict emergency rule made barisal even more vulnerable to mysterious happenings. when we were getting bored watching the one sided election results on the night following 4 august, barisal came with the unusual jerk, so desperately needed to break the boredom. brushing aside all the predictions, a candidate supported by a newly formed and recently divided king's party came to limelight marginally following the main candidate. fortunately, i am married to a not-so-mysterious barisal woman, who has a lot of politically informed relatives. i used my mobile phone to know about the whole drama. the end of the drama became tragic for the surprise candidate. we could see on television the helpless face of the returning officer declaring the number of votes polled by different candidates but he refrained from declaring the highest vote gatherer as winner.
upgrading zia
yes, i agree that zia airport is not up to the standards of any modern airport in our neighbouring areas like bangkok, singapore or the middle eastern countries. we do need an upgrade to improve the image and make it a more attractive place for all tourists and foreigners who come to bangladesh for whatever purpose. but, being a less endowed nation than those other countries, bangladesh is still cash strapped to be able to compete. perhaps it will happen but may be not when we all want. i do agree that building another airport from scratch may not be a good idea since that will be so much more expensive. i don't see that sort of a quantum leap in people coming in/leaving that necessitates such a radical plan at this point of time. again, may be in the future.

dhaka marathon
"…bangladesh is a nation of 150m people; the biggest nation never to have won an olympic medal”.

election and quality of candidates…
in the recent local election the caretaker govt. tried their best to attract as many educated candidates as they could but admitted their inability to do more than what they did since at the end of the day it is the educated person's decision whether he would run the election or not. we saw so many candidates who didn't even finish high school but ran for mayoral election. now the question arises whether the govt. has failed to attract the educated class into politics or the educated class failed the country to lead? my answer to this query is somewhat in the middle.

27th bcs
the viva voce of the 27th bcs exams has recently been completed and the result will be published soon. a few days back a report carrying the news of vacant posts of the cadre service was published in ds. there has not been any recruitment in the cadre service, though almost three (03) years have passed after the circular of the 27th bcs was issued. on the other hand, there is shortage of manpower in the administration that creates problems in many sectors of the administration. many can argue that if large scale recruitment is completed the quality will go down, but i don't believe that. all the candidates are from different universities. i'd like to give an example. in the 27th bcs a total 16,000 candidates participated and if 750 of them are declared qualified in the general cadre the quality will not go down. recently, the judicial service commission appointed 394 assistant judges.

clean up gulshan lake
the gulshan lake has a nice walkway on its western bank, and every morning a lot of residents including many women from gulshan, badda and nearby areas take their morning walk. unfortunately, the bank of the lake is sullied by refuse and garbage being dumped there; mostly by the residents of the flats and houses bordering the western lakeside. possibly the same thing happens in the eastern side of the lake too, but there is no walkway. i have seen garbage being brought from badda and dumped on the north-west corner of the walkway into the lake. i have pointed it to the police in their camp right opposite this corner; but they couldn't care less. possibly they too dump the refuse from their camp, into the lake! despite many complaints to the gulshan municipality, they do nothing about it. is it not a part of their conservancy function? view the page international
