rti begins journey
we commend the government for finally forming the rti commission. however, we reserve our comments about the appropriateness of its composition. out of the three members of the commission, two are former bureaucrats. ironically, the perception of bureaucrats acting in favour of suppressing information and refusing to make them public still has deep root in people's minds. and there are reasons for that. for decades, government and semi-government sectors have been keeping valuable information tied with the infamous “red tape” in the name of maintaining official secrecy. the practice only resulted in breeding suspicion and contempt in public mind. with the information commission now set to start functioning, it would be a trial for the members how best they would perform in breaking the bureaucratic hold on information.
us soldiers depart from iraq's towns and cities
the withdrawal of american troops from iraqi towns and cities six years after the us-led invasion in 2003 is surely glad tidings for the people of iraq. after all, it is iraqis who have, in all these years since us and british troops invaded the country on the dubious question of the saddam hussein regime concealing weapons of mass destruction, paid a high price in terms of loss of lives and destruction of property. one of the more disturbing manifestations of the invasion of iraq was the swift breakdown of law and order followed by the rise of extremist groups convinced that the foreigners had to be pushed out of the country. tensions between the shia and sunni communities took an unprecedented shape and tens of thousands of iraqis lost their lives in such diverse tragedies as suicide killings and assaults by western forces. not even the baghdad offices of the united nations were spared. while saddam hussein and his associates met with a grisly end, iraqis fell prey to chaos of a kind they had never before experienced in their lives. as many as 4,321 american soldiers have been killed in the country since april 2003.

in search of better government, or is it governance?
learning from southeast asian countries would be difficult but bangladesh has very little option.” this enigmatic sentence broadly sums up mohammad mohabbat khan's approach to the problem of governance in bangladesh in the book under review. from government to governance is a compilation of three articles written specifically for the volume, and twelve others that were published in various publications from as far back as in 1987 to as recent as in 2007 (although the author avers that they were written between 1991 and 2006). the twenty year span shows in the unevenness in quality of the articles. the author states at the outset his mission for cobbling together the anthology: “this book has primarily focuses (sic) on…extension of public administration and describes how certain other countries have changed the role of administration due to change in external environment…. based on this light, this book has attempted to make a modest effort to highlight both the need for a better public service in bangladesh and prescribed some measures to achieve it through learning from others.”
giving the police a human face
policing has regularly been a difficult proposition in south asia. that the police are ruthless or inefficient or corrupt or all of these has never been in doubt. that governments in the region have traditionally sought to exercise partisan political control over policemen is another reality from which there is no escaping. you travel to india, pakistan, bangladesh and sri lanka, your objective being an attempt at understanding the compulsions under which the police operate and the difficulties that the police often subject citizens to. and then, of course, there is that overriding wish in you to come by the measures that may have been taken by the governments of these countries to bring the police level with their counterparts around the world. disappointment would be staring you in the face.
a delicious collection of epistles
mary ann shaffer's the guernsey literary and potato peel pie society came to me like a wish granted. for the last few weeks, i had been longing to read a book written in letters. not only is this book a delicious collection of epistles, it has elements not often found all together in one book: wit, pathos, romance, honest representations of true-to-life, yet individualistic characters, exciting events, lots of literary references and a unique, eye-catching title.
retracing japan's legacy
retracing the singularity of a race or a linguistic community poses to be one significant challenge of our time, the world of globalization. though equally modern in terms of industrial development and living standards, tradition and cultural integrity finds an important place in the life of japan. viewed from this perspective, probir bikash sarker's japaner nadi nari ful,, a book chiefly on japan's traditional past, (river, geisha, and sakura ) appears to be a significant effort to make us familiar with this aspect.
