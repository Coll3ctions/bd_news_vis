high court warning on custodial killings
we are heartened by the warning served on the government by the high court on the matter of three recent deaths in police custody. coming on the heels of an earlier hc directive on the issue, this warning should be an eye-opener for the authorities. it should alert it to the clear violation of the law and human rights that the law enforcers themselves have been indulging in of late. by taking up the matter in right earnest, the judiciary has given the nation to understand that not all is lost, that indeed it is possible for us to have the rule of law form the centerpiece of collective life in the future. in other words, there is reason to hope that decency and morality along with the law will eventually be the cornerstone of life in bangladesh.

elevated expressway
the government has decided that dhaka city will have elevated expressway from narayanganj to hazrat shahjalal airport touching all important points within the city to reduce traffic jam. everyone should welcome this decision. this is a good proposal to solve the public transport problem. we have very limited road link compared to the standard cities of world. in general this will be constructed over the existing main roads having columns on the middle of roads, so paying compensation for acquiring new land will be minimum.

spain's triumph

capital punishment
i remember when i was a student at the dhaka university, we had to learn "functional english". there was a piece where the writer discussed the prison sentences and questioned whether providing facilities there would encourage people to go there and what would deter the criminals from committing crimes. in his famous book, "the great train robbery", late michael crichton also discussed these in some details. i think it was bryce ciurtenay who had written about england and how the english rulers tried to get rid of the criminals by deporting them.
question leakage
this refers to the news report regarding a section of government employees who had allegedly leaked question papers. they used an innovative method to supply question papers to the candidates they had an agreement with. intelligence warning on such leakage plot led to police action. while the intelligence bureau should be commended for sounding an alarm just five days before the question leakage from the bangladesh government press in rangpur, it is remarkable that the police were able to take cognisance of the warning and act on it. in view of the fact that the leakage occurred long time earlier, the information from the ib should have been given proper importance and adequate precautions taken.
ramshackle vehicles
the drive against 20 years old vehicles running on the city's most busy routes is welcome. the ds and other dailies gave a shabby picture of transportation several times but nothing has been done. the authorities concerned have to address the issue in right earnest.

english medium education
a lot of english medium schools are available in dhaka city like video shops but who are the teachers over there and what's their qualification?
railway services

negative thinking
there are politicians who dream of the day when they will come to power and plan in advance what misdeed and mischief they will do if people vote for them. this negative politics can do little good to society.
teachers' performance
prof. bais's appreciation for the introduction of teaching evaluation at jnu (published in daily star 18 july) is well placed. however, if i were him, i would brace myself for a few surprises and probably start thinking of ways to deal with them in advance; hence the reason for writing here.
cell phones in flight
no doubt, cell phone is a boon to our modern-day living. it helps us to keep in touch with nearest and dearest ones plus in maintaining important communications. but unfortunately the cell phone users often ignore safety codes. recently, i witnessed in a malaysia airlines flight that in spite of repeated requests over microphone, quite a number of passengers continued using their cell phones. many air-passengers are reluctant to appreciate the risk of operating cell phones particularly during take-off and landing because modern aircrafts are being digitally controlled. the cell phone signals may cause serious interference to aircraft's digital communication network and cause malfunctioning with errors.
power generation master plan
this is about your star business report of 15th. july on the round table organised by the 'energy & power' magazine on its seventh anniversary. the main topic of discussion, was based on the government's recently published five year master plan on additional sources of power generation between the years 2010 to 2015. the key note paper however, presented a total generation in five years; of 9426 mw of power, from traditional energy sources which are natural gas, liquid fuel (diesel &furnace oil) and coal only. three important major issues on this matter, which are critical for the power sector in bangladesh connotation, were unfortunately not covered in the keynote paper presented. these are: a) nuclear energy b) alternative and renewable energy and finally c) energy efficiency. view the page international
