bsf chief's statement regrettable
we recall the indian home minister p chidambaram's emphatic assurances on a visit to dhaka in july last that 'under no circumstances' would the indian border security forces fire upon anyone trying to cross from bangladesh to india. he even added, "the message has gone down to the last jawan." against such a backdrop, we are appalled by the bsf chief's observations to the bbc on january 7, 2012 that it is not possible for them to stop firing at the border. seeing the deliberate nature of his comment, we cannot but be shocked and surprised. we wonder how a border security chief who works under the home ministry could make such a statement that runs counter to the spirit and letter of the assurances given by his minister. we are confused and perturbed at this disconnect between the indian home ministry and its subordinate apparatus, the bsf.
