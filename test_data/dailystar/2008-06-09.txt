reduced adp for 2008-09
the new adp marks a departure from the pattern of ambitious development programs that we ended up revising year after year and yet not implementing even the whittled down physical targets of development. while in the past, financial targets got somewhat met with hurried low quality expenditure at the fag end of the year, the end results would invariably fall far short of the targets. this is glaringly exemplified by hundreds of unfinished bridges and culverts across the country as depicted lately in the pictorial news report in a prominent bangla daily.

the primary and mass education ministry's proposal to create a separate bcs cadre service for primary education is a long overdue one, and we are gratified to see that the government is taking this up for consideration. as long ago as 1992, a government taskforce recommended this measure, and the government of the day pledged to adopt it by 2005, so it is to the credit of the current government that a step is being taken for the betterment of the sector.
america's flawed imperial policy

social vulnerability in coastal areas
bangladesh is recognised around the world as a disaster-prone country. this isn't because god is angry with us (as some would maintain!) but rather our unique location at the crossing point of two different environments (the himalayas in the north and the bay of bengal in the south). the topography is low and flat, with 10% of the land barely 1metre above the mean sea level (msl). the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) in 2001 identified countries like ours as the most vulnerable to climate change.
as the oceans rise
journalists consider themselves crusty, unsentimental creatures who, their battered fedoras shoved back on their heads, have slouched out of ben hecht's 1928 play "the front page," oozing skepticism from every pore. actually, they are round-heeled romantics, such pushovers for a new swain that they did not laugh until their ribs squeaked when barack obama concluded his triumphal st. paul, minn., speech by proclaiming: "i am absolutely certain that generations from now, we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick …" view the page sports

budget expectations
budget- take it or leave it- can't address every wealth creation, savings mobilization, driving growth or equitable distribution issues. ultimate growth and development require commitment from the political regime, better governance, accountable civil bureaucracy and effective local government.
investing in long-term economic future
given the triple global shocks of us recession, record oil prices and rampant food inflation, the relative strength of the bangladesh economy is something that the country can be proud of. add to this the lagged impact of cyclone sidr and the current projected official growth rate forecast of 6.2 percent for fy 2007/08 is a testament to resilience of entrepreneurs and workers in the private sector.
focus on agriculture for food security
as we await the announcement of the budget for 2008-9 let us spare a thought for what the honourable finance adviser has to contend with: record oil prices, soaring food prices and shortages, financial crises and recessionary economies and major natural disasters. compounded with the political crisis in bangladesh pre 1/11, the heightened expectations of the people after 1/11 and the current political crisis, delivering this budget is a daunting task. especially as this next budget must deliver on certain key areas.
priorities for it sector
in this budget the it industry is anxiously waiting to see some pro-active measures to save the sector from further stagnation. both the domestic and export markets have literally taken a nose dive in the last two years. export revenues have registered 4 percent and 34 percent drops in the last two years according to the latest figures from epb. needless to say that a thriving it sector is a sine qua non for the economic development of the country in the 21st century. to reverse this alarming trend the government needs to give the market the right cues for bringing growth back through appropriate financial incentives and facilitation measures. let me take you through some of these:

upcoming budget
the 2008-2009 budget is going to be announced very soon. there are great expectations among the people from the budget. i think that the budget should be pro-employment, because the burden of unemployment is growing day by day in our country. besides employment, the budget should be pro-education, pro-agriculture, pro-investment & pro-development. the industrial & telecommunication sector should be emphasized. the size of the adp should be reasonable. utilisation of funds, transparency & sustainability should be ensured. and both formal & informal sectors have to be given due importance.

as expatriate bangladeshis we are earning foreign currency and remitting it to bangladesh. we don't know how that money is spent in the country.

the remittances of bangladeshi people working abroad are the main source of foreign currency of our economy. without this income bangladesh has no future. the recent news that our people in some countries are in serious trouble is cause for extreme concern. the bangladesh govt. must take some strong action to improve the image of our country.

pope's initiative
i wish to commend pope benedict xvi for his most recent liturgical initiatives. some may recall that a few months ago the pope celebrated mass in the sistine chapel facing the east rather than the people. more recently, on the feast of corpus christi (may 22, 2008), pope benedict xvi, for his papal mass outside the basilica of st. john lateran, had a kneeler placed at the foot of the altar and distributed holy communion to four dozen communicants - all of whom knelt and received the eucharist on the tongue. this latest initiative is in keeping with those orthodox practices which the church strongly recommends. archbishop albert malcolm ranjith patabendige don, secretary of the congregation for divine worship and the sacraments, commented on the significance of the pope's gesture saying: "i hope this practice spreads."
