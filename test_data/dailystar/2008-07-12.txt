a steady, sure blossoming of bengali nationalism
there have been all the analyses of the events and incidents that led to the language movement of 1952. you could therefore ask if there is any particular need at this point for a new interpretation or presentation of the case for the bengali language. of course, there is, if the work you have in hand is ama muhith's. there is a particular charm in reading this book, and it is that the writer goes to extraordinary lengths to examine the political situation obtaining in pakistan before and after the tragic deaths of bengali young men on the streets of dhaka on 21 february 1952. in conditions where much of haze yet dominates our understanding of the nature of the movement that reached a climax in 1952, muhith does an exemplary job of researching the micro as well as macro aspects of the old struggle.
shobjikhichuri and chitolmachher dopeyaja, aaaah!
times were, and this i remember from my childhood though i probably shouldn't say it since it is revealing of my advanced age, when cooking was a mystery wrapped in enigmatic colours and smells and was the sole monopoly of our mothers. cooking signalled its presence every day with the ritual trotting off of either the household help, (a small tart-tongued boy in our case), or in more traditional households the head of the household, to the market with a bajaarer tholi . the day's middle passage was garnished, marked by sounds of activity, along with the occasional din of pots and pans and slices of old-fashioned tongue-lashing at ham-handed kitchen help, emanating from the kitchen which in those days was so eminently women's domain. it would end with mother emerging after a cleansing bath clad in a fresh sari late in the afternoon for her ceremonial lunch, eaten only after everybody else had. in a habit picked up from her mother, the onion slices and green chillies laid on a separate plate had to be arranged just so!
one man's search for identity along lonely streets
a house for mr biswas is the story of a man's search for his own address. does every individual have an address, an abode, a house, a shelter, a home of his own? is mr biswas a vagabond, a rootless identity with no place of his own? it is a man's quest to free himself from the social shackles, to break away from tight traditions of joint family and conservative community customs and find a place and an identity of his own.
stories in poetic style
creative writing gurus say the title of a novel or a book always matters to readers. if a book has an attractive or meaningful title along with good content, the book has all the chance of being gleefully accepted by the audience, readers as well as critics. many opine that the title tells half the story of a book, even a collection of short stories.
