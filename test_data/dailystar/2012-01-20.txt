the tv footage of a bangladeshi being tortured by bsf personnel was, to say the least, appalling and contemptible. it shows a depraved mentality. the indian tv channels deserve compliments for exposing the brutal side of the bsf behaviour at the borders. the pictures were a shocking and outrageous narrative of how one cattle smuggler was tied hand and feet after being deprived of his clothes and mercilessly beaten up by the bsf jawans, apparently for not paying up the bsf for plying his trade, smuggling cows.

buses violating traffic rules
i am writing this as a complaint against brtc buses that stop on the mohakhali flyover to pick and drop passengers without caring about the hindrance they cause to the traffic flow behind. buses shou7ld not use the flyovers since all motor vehicles are not supposed to stop on them except in case of emergency. bus drivers break rules, they behave as if the roads belong to them. they must be stopped from doing so by the authorities. i request the authorities to kindly ensure that buses stop only at designated bus stops. they must also pull over at the kerb instead of stopping on the middle of the road, sometimes diagonally, causing serious traffic jam.

how does ghulam azam explain himself to himself?
it was deceiving to look at the man although one already knew his looks would be deceiving. for the same reason, hatred was a difficult emotion to summon when one saw this bespectacled bug-eyed octogenarian prisoner whose flowing beard is white as the driven snow. this nation took a close look at ghulam azam for the first time in many years, and suffered from that quiet confusion. his imposing bearing scornfully betrayed our knowledge of his infamous background when television cameras zoomed in on his face on the courthouse steps and inside a prison van.

our food security
food security plays an important role in social and political stability of a country. but sustaining agricultural growth and food security is a challenge for the present day world, especially for developing countries. climate change and disasters aggravate the risk further. international organisations are warning about hunger and food insecurity risks in many countries. in this context, the bangladesh government is considering the issue with utmost priority because bangladesh is one of the most disaster prone countries of the world. the disaster-hit people need emergency food assistance, as their capacity to access to markets falls drastically. increasing population, poverty (31.5% of the population is still poor), decreasing availability of land resources and seasonal umemployment in agriculture sector compound the problems. thus, ensuring food security and effective disaster management are the two enormous challenges for the government.
