question paper leak at bg press
there is little question that corruption in government is a sad reality we have lived with for years. even so, there is in us that certain feeling that as governance improves and public sensibilities get to be more sharpened, such wrongdoing will be rolled back and the country can move on toward its desired goals. that being the sentiment, it comes as a shock for all us that some government staff have been involved in the crime of leaking question papers in return for dishonest financial gains. the crime we speak of concerns the bangladesh government (bg) press taking place in rangpur and involving a number of candidates for the position of assistant teachers at public high schools. as a report in this newspaper on saturday notes, elements at the bg press sold question papers related to an interview for the positions for a rather staggering amount of tk. 25 lakh. the interview was, of course, cancelled as a consequence of the leak.
an mp sued by police sergeant
just because one is an elected law-maker from the ruling party, one is not entitled to manhandling a police sergeant on duty, no matter what was the latter's perceived omission or commission, if any. it was a traffic jam in which the mp's car was stuck and he demanded an explanation from the policeman for something that was hardly of his own making. even if it was, that would hardly have been a justification for any person, far less, a member of the incumbent party, to rough up a police man by slapping him in the face or otherwise hitting him. apparently dissatisfied with what the policeman had to say, he reacted physically in a manifest arrogance of position. mind you, this was done in wanton disregard for public norms, not to say placing hindrance in the way of a policeman at work. or was he expecting that the sergeant would let his transport pass in breach of rules? view the page sports

the ex-factor
as the bus took a late evening break at a restaurant during our journey to bogra, we wanted to eat light as dinner wasn't too far off. we asked the young boy who waited on us, what was available. off he went reciting rapid-fire, a list of tummy filling, yummy items. anything light to eat? i asked. a chicken sandwich he suggested with a big smile, though a chicken kebab would be more palatable, he went on. so we settled for the kebab, which was done well and did taste more of spices than of chicken meat. russel, as he was being called, brought in just the right sized mineral water bottle so there wasn't any waste. the hot cup of tea followed promptly. all said and done, with russel's attention to details, the stoppage was a pleasant experience, quite unlike another experience i had on a similar journey.

world cup and octopus!
with the sad and humiliating exit of brazil and argentina, world cup football has, to a certain extent, lost its flavour in certain parts of the world and bangladesh in particular.
ensure uniformity
in schools, it is the uniformity of dress, shoes, belts, ties, etc., that creates an atmosphere of oneness among children, irrespective of the background they hail from. once in college, all hell seems to break loose with children of rich families flaunting their wealth that includes wearing expensive and fashionable dresses, using costly mobile phones, and spending lavishly in the canteens. this hurts the feelings of the not-so-rich, leading to factionalism, ill-will, and unhealthy competition. affluent students can indulge in extravaganza outside their colleges but ostentatious display of wealth should not be allowed on campuses. colleges, therefore, should have uniforms; ban the use of mobile phones within the college precincts; ban students from bringing two- and four-wheelers to colleges. such measures will go a long way in bringing about equality and uniformity and improvement in the academic environment.
noise pollution
once beautiful dhaka is facing lots of challenges and myriad problems. noise pollution, beyond any doubt, is a matter of great concern as it has already exceeded the tolerable limits.
world cup 2010

the two women
more than a year ago a picture that was published in all major daily news paper focused on madam khaleda zia wailing at the bedside of her politician son---tareque zia at pg hospital where she went soon after her release from the confinement. tareque zia was there under treatment for his injury that was inflicted upon him, as claimed by madam zia due to political rivalry. a mother's natural sympathy forced her to cry openly and she pleaded that tareque was sick and he would not be in politics again until he recovered from the sickness. tears rolled down her cheek. it was painful to see.

two very pathetic incidents have hugely shaken our society. one is the suicide committed by a mother and her two children and the other is obviously the killing of a little boy.
access road

mobile phone
we know there are many advantages of mobile phone nowadays and there is no doubt about it.
colonial concept
since ages the concept of leadership has been colonial in south east asia, more so in bangladesh. with the passage of time over the years things have changed but this concept of leadership continues. though democracy is in vogue but the colonial concept of leadership remains. the son of the king becomes the king; this concept is very much deep rooted in the minds of the people. so long this concept remains in practice, bangladesh shall not achieve progress in the true sense of the word.
building complete, function zero
a news item in the daily star (july 2nd, 2010 page 12, column 1-4) says, that a four-story building at mag osmani medical college in sylhet was lying idle for more than three and a half years. this building was intended for the icu unit and a large casualty ward. for the functioning of the building two other components were necessary, i.e. the urgent need for the medical supplies and the instruments, and the doctors and nurses and ancillary staff, down to the cleaners. for the success of the above project, there had to be necessary co-ordination, for all the three needs. failure of co-ordination is a complete waste of our own very scare resources. the above instance can be found in hundreds of our own projects. what is the remedy? a good management team is not enough.
ipo refund warrant
i have been applying for ipos for some time but unfortunately i am so far unsuccessful in all my attempts. but what is causing me pain is the manner in which the refund warrants are issued in cases where the amounts could not be credited to the account online.
killing by police
recent deaths in police custody particularly in dhaka city are highly disturbing. a suspected drug dealer was tortured to death in front of his minor son. it was not only inhuman, rather sadistic in nature. another small business owner was arrested from his own rented house and later killed in a so called encounter. in both the cases there are allegations of demand of bribe. the media has rightly highlighted the incidents. the authorities instituted inquiries. but recurrence of such incidents is shaking public faith in law enforcing agencies. the government's image is being tarnished. it appears that the chain of command and discipline in police is on the wane. political leadership in the ministry appears caught in the bureaucratic entrapment legalising all the misdeeds. perhaps a major shake- up is necessary.
mrp
i'm a bangladeshi national living in italy. i have resident permit for italy which will expire soon. but now italian immigration department is not receiving any application to renew resident permit with the hand written bangladeshi passport. currently, they accept only machine readable passport.
al government
a careful look at the political state of affairs in bangladesh will substantiate an argument that the sheikh hasina regime is a continuation of the military-backed interim government that had ruled the country for about two years, before her party came to power. sheikh hasina and many of her party people were jailed and tortured during those two years, and she claimed that there had been an attempt on her life through mixing poison with her food. her statement in this regard can be interpreted in two ways: 1. she made the statement to gain public sympathy, which explains why she is not taking any action against those who wanted to kill her 2. her statement is true, but she is unable to take any action, as she is not in command of the affairs of bangladesh.
price of electricity
the finance minister mr. a.m.a. muhith has hinted that price of electricity will be hiked. this has created panic in the industrial sector. the textile sector is already hard hit due to price hike of yarn in the recent months.
laws on national flag
i feel happy to see that the government is going to amend laws in order to uphold the honour of the country's national flag which is the symbol of our nation. very often it is noticed that our flags are hoisted atop many buildings without following any norms. view the page international

six years after british director of indian origin gurinder chadha made “bride and prejudice”, a bollywood treatment of british writer jane austen's novel, it is the turn of debutant indian director rajashree ojha to adapt another book “emma” by the 19th century author into a hindi movie “aisha”.
“choita pagol” on channel i
a naive young man, choita, whom the villagers call “pagol” (crazy), remains seemingly stable for 11 months. for a month every year, choita turns insane. the villagers exploit choita and make him do all kinds of chores. but when he turns “mad,” he is shunned by all. even when he goes without food for days, no one comes to his aid. the drama serial “choita pagol” narrates his story.
