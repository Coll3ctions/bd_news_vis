cng price rise
agreat sense of relief motorists and transport owners have so far derived amidst high prices of octane, petrol and diesel from the low cng price tag. but that relieving spot has been somewhat taken away by the doubling of cng price now. some upward adjustment in cng price was inevitable, if the books of bangladesh petroleum corporation (bpc), or for that matter, the subsidy budget of the government, were to be balanced. yet raising the price by hundred percent by one single stroke is something that can have a shock effect on the road transport sector that is associated with environment-friendly use of fuel.

overcoming the bleak power generation scenario
the power generation scenario with the onset of this summer season is going from bad to worse. it has been learnt from the pdb sources that the country's average power generation capacity has come down to 3700 megawatts as against the demand of 4350 megawatts. but unofficially the demand curve exceeds 5000 megawatts. special assistant to the chief adviser on power and energy professor m.tamim said in a recent press briefing that the shortage of power at the moment is more due to transmission problem than generational. it has been further learnt that constraints in supplying gas from bibiyana and jalalabad gas fields to power plants at ghorasal, siddhirganj and chittagong now stands in the way of enhancing power generation. shockingly, as professor tamim said, the move taken in 2005 to install 4 (four) compressors at the national grid with the assistance of adb for increasing gas pressure did not materialise. compounding the problem is the sudden drop of gas extraction from the only offshore gas field sangu which cairn energy plc, the operator of the gas field, failed to ascertain earlier. further, their effort to extract gas from other wells including mognama and hatiya has not met with success.

sandwip-urir char-noakhali cross dam for long-term food security
bangladesh with a population of 150 million and having only 91,500 sq km of land under cultivation is in a critical state so far as food security is concerned. environmentally it is also in a crucial situation with less than 15 percent forest cover (preferable 25 percent). available agricultural lands are fast depleting as: (i) about 100 sq km of agricultural land is eroded by rivers each year; and (ii) about another 1300 sq km is going out from agricultural to non-agricultural uses each year. population increase of about 2 percent per year and simultaneous reduction of cultivable land are making the situation more and more precarious day by day. increase of cultivable lands by reclamation from meghna estuary is one of the viable alternatives for enhancing individual and national food security as well as improving natural environment.

idealistic conviction
way back i had read pakistani writer umme umara's short story about 1971, 'the sin of innocence,' in a collection of stories from pakistan. it was the first time i read pakistani writers on our liberation war. after that, however, i could not access any more of their writing on this subject. until now, when professor niaz zaman and asif farrukhi from bangladesh and pakistan have jointly edited fault lines: stories of 1971 (dhaka: upl; 2008). umme umara's story, coincidentally, is the first one here. the volume is noteworthy for its attempt to portray the diverse, complicated experience of 1971 from both sides, with stories translated from bangla, urdu, punjabi and sindhi, as well as some originally written in english. translations rather than stories written originally in english form the main bulk of the book.
buddhadev bose and 1971: bhadralok communalism?
buddhadev bose was a prolific letter writer. in amar chelebela he narrates how during his noakhali childhood he was his family's designated letter writer, and about its post office and indolent postmaster. in amar joubon he rues the loss of several hundred letters to ravenous termites. now we have buddhadev bosur chithi , a collection of his letters written to his younger daughter damayanti singh bose from 1962 till his death in 1974. these were first published--178 out of roughly 300--in 1988-89 in west bengal's desh magazine. they have been reprinted in a 256-page volume, the language even in these informal, sometimes-dashed-off missives gleaming like zamindari heirlooms. its flow is marred by busy footnotes by damayanti, who otherwise has penned a loving tribute to him. in these pages buddhadev emerges as a conscientious, affectionate father and family man. no less valuable is the portrait drawn of '60s calcutta, its gritty materiality. view the page star health

whispers in the heart and mysticism in the soul
kamrun haque tells a tale of art coming in combination with the calling of the heart. and it helps that she is an artist herself, for such a background explains not just the various manifestations of aesthetics in purely modern terms but also provides details of why an appreciation of art could eventually turn out to be a study of the artist herself. the forty-something anish's admiration, followed by infatuation followed by a falling head over heels in love with the slightly over twenty trisha, is but an instance when the image and the image maker become a complete whole for an individual. it is the paintings at ajanta and ellora that trisha admires. for anish, a west bengali indian resident in distant canada, it is the art in the being of east bengali trisha that matters. he then falls in love with the art, eventually to discover in it the woman he needs to love.
dictators and the irrelevance of life
the master storyteller in isabelle allende holds up a world of dictatorship through the eyes of a poet in of love and shadows. it is a story of love, triumph and tragedy that can occur under a dictatorship. it is a love story about a journalist, irene beltrán, and a photographer, francisco leal. they live in a country in latin america that is run by a military dictatorship. it is also a story that unearths the brutalities perpetrated under harsh military rule. it is a beautiful story that grows in the folds of atrocities, love that finds roots while two souls search for justice.
unity of various sensibilities
love is a symbol of truth and beauty and gives us insights into blissful and spiritual life. without love and affection, it is rather difficult to think about the existence of the soul in the body. loving humankind and feeling empathy, delight and liberty are the four aspects of true love. love is tranquil, quiet, honest, virtuous and based on conviction, esteem, confidence, support and truth. it does not have any room for jealousy, distrust, conceit, snobbery and unfairness. love excuses all. love happens when a wish is developed from an attraction, which leads to submission and then urges one to take the path to commitment. a deep attachment is felt for the person we love; we feel sensitive and are mesmerised by our love and thus seek devotion and regard. love brings people together, as opposed to hate which separates people from one another. love is refined and if allowed to flow naturally will smoothen the trail chosen after birth. love makes life healthier and fuller. these comprise the essence of murtaja baseer's poetry. to express wonder and to feel exceptional sensibility are two kinds of emotional experience. he excels in uniting different sensibilities
ramblings and poetry
‘i read a book one day, and my whole life was changed.' thus begins pamuk's the new life, the fastest-selling title in turkish history. contradictorily to all praises, to me the opening line comes like the beginning of a review by a fan of paulo coelho. but perhaps that's what pamuk meant when he says in this book, 'a good book is something that reminds us of the whole world'.
