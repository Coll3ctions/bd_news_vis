creating an atmosphere for elections
chief election commissioner atm shamsul huda revealed yesterday that he has demanded of the government that emergency be either lifted or relaxed in all places where city corporation or municipal polls are to be held. he has also asked that indoor politics be permitted from march 20. the difficulties associated with the holding of polls to the four city corporations and nine municipalities, slated for april, as well as the projected general elections by the end of the year, thus become obvious. so far the political parties have remained in a straitjacket where preparing for the elections is concerned. in broad measure, it is the people of bangladesh whose minds are now being greatly exercised over the prospects of early elections and a return to democratic government.

the mangled bangla that we speak …
all these years after the language movement, it makes sense to ask what we have lately been doing with bengali, or bangla as many would like to call it. that sense of inquiry becomes rather important, indeed acquires urgency of a sort, considering that in a very large number of instances the bengali language has been getting pretty mangled and, in the end, muddled altogether.

suggestions for ec
the forthcoming general election in bangladesh is going to be a free and fair election mainly due to the use of a voter-list with photograph and photo id for all voters. the election commission and the administration concerned with holding of the election have also significantly changed. however, i would like to draw the attention of the election commission to the election procedures, materials and tools.
habit of drinking water
i migrated to the usa in december, 1994. i am originally from bangladesh and was born at narayangonj in 1968. there are lots of things i like and enjoy in the usa. however, one thing that has been shocking me since my arrival here is that in my observation here the people do not drink plain water frequently enough. well, over time, even back in bangladesh where i go back almost every year to spend my vacation time, these days many people are also getting clogged with busy schedules and i noticed that lots of people, especially who work long hours, tend to drink less water. drinking less water is becoming a social concern around the world.
high prices of essentials
the prices of essential commodities, such as rice, dal, wheat, oil, vegetables, etc. have gone further up during the last few days in our country. it is called an agricultural country but nowadays, rice sells at tk 30 or 35 per kg. it has already gone beyond the buying capacity of the common people. fish which is now scarcely available in the market is selling very dear. besides, the prices of vegetables have gone up very high. we the students of a university/university college cannot buy all the necessary things, because we are students and do not have enough money. the rising prices of foods and essential commodities are causing great hardship to the people of all classes.
introduce 'drug test'
it can be observed with great concern that drug addiction is on the rise in our society and a large number of our youths are addicted to drugs. the government and some non government organisations are trying their best to minimize the problem. but we do not see any visible improvement. here i present a scheme which could be very successful to keep our youths away from drugs.

there have been numerous explanations and definitions of war through theories, such as: historical, psychological, demographic, marxist, economic, and rationalist, among others. in one word; war is any large scale violent act which many times resolves in the destruction of one's territory, nation, and lives. war is learned and has evolved through history, these days war is conducted through military campaigns, which includes: armed conflict, intelligence, troops movement, propaganda, aircraft, bombs and missiles.
politicians
in our country, the education of a politician is not specified. for this reason , an uneducated man can be a politician or the head of a party.
war criminals
have we forgotten the 'war criminal' issue? no one seems to like talking about it any more. all societies truly abhor crimes committed during wars. horrific memories of '71 genocide have left our country embittered with pain and sorrow. this will only heal if we bring all those war criminals to justice.
different stars!
after reading the cover article of the star weekend magazine, on the bangladesh special olympics team, i was thoroughly moved. all that the team wants is to make their homeland proud. the disabled have just as much right and claim on bangladesh as we have. they have done so much better than our other competing athletes. all they want is respect. and they have earned that right. bravo !
press freedom
freedom of speech, freedom of press etc. are the pre-requisites of democracy. more or less our press is free. even during the autocratic rule of ershad, our press was enjoying freedom unlike many others in the present day world. we are quite happy about it and hope none will be able to snatch away this right from us in future.
responsible and transparent
two thousand and eight years after the death of christ, the political and economic programmes and processes would be worth mentioning in bangladesh. like a train, the caretaker government (ctg) headed by dr. fakhruddin ahmed is steaming ahead on a railway track with the reformed and reorganised election commission (ec), public service commission (psc) and the separation of the judiciary from the executive branch of the government.
qatar and bangladesh

kissinger's comment
moinul chowdhury (letter january 18) is the latest of many to misunderstand henry kissinger's awful comment about bangladesh, which is a great deal worse than 'bottomless basket'. that conveys the notion of some nation or person having endless needs and, actually, if kissinger had meant that, he would probably have used the more likely english expression 'a bucket with a hole in the bottom'. no, he said that bangladesh was a 'basket-case' - and the real meaning of that is much more insulting. view the page international
