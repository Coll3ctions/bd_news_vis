origin of modern humans
according to our knowledge of evolution, life has originated 3.5 billion years ago in a form of single cell wrapping essential molecules required to form life. after that, complexity came in life forms, multicellular organisms emerged, and evolution turned to macroevolution from microevolution. the first dinosaurs appeared 245 million years ago and dominated the earth till 65 million years ago. a comet or sudden meteoric shower on earth was, probably, responsible for their extinction. ancient humans originated later after that. i am going to focus the origin of modern humans according to paleontology, the earth science that studies fossil organisms and related remains, and genetic evidence found to date. since the separation of archaic humans, the hominids, from the apes around 5-7 million years ago the evolutionary tree generated branches for the newer ones. from the hominids, the genus homo had diverged around 2 million years ago in africa.
ancient rocks hints at earth's origin
recently geochemists studying arctic rocks have discovered evidence of ancient rock from the earth's interior, which, they claim, is as old as the earth itself. much of the material that made up the early earth was lost and modified as the processes of melted mantle began firing up magma to form earth's crust and plate tectonics then mixed that crust back into the mantle below. team-leader dr. matthew jackson, geochemist, boston university and his group of international researchers discovered this recently from the lava samples of greenland and baffin island in the canadian arctic only suggest this astounding possibility. beneath this particular environmental setting lies a region of the earth's mantle that has largely escaped the billions of years of melting and geological shake-up that has affected the rest of the planet. it must be understood that the mantle is the layer of viscous, super-hot rock that stirs below the solid crust of the planet's surface. naturally, when covered by 5-to-25-mile-thick crust, this mantle, which actually makes up four-fifths of earth's volume, is difficult to get to and study. and even when samples of the mantle are found, they usually happen to be relatively young and recycled, emerging at the surface of earth as molten volcanic material. but the rocks that dr. jackson & company discovered were spewed up to the surface of earth by an eruption about 60 million years ago. scientists believe that the newly discovered mantle “reservoir” as it is now called, dates from just few tens of millions years after the earth was first assembled from the collisions of smaller bodies. it is also believed that this reservoir very likely houses the basic elements of compositions of the mantle shortly after the formation of the earth's interior core. the same very elements that existed before the 4.5 billion-years' process of crust formation and recycling, modified the composition of most of the rest of the earth's interior. according to co-author dr. richard carlson of carnegie institution's dept. of terrestrial magnetism, “this was a key phase in the evolution of earth. it set the stage for everything that came after”.

a new kind of chlorophyll that catches sunlight from just beyond the red end of the visible light spectrum has been discovered. the new pigment extends the known range of light that is usable by most photosynthetic organisms. harnessing this pigment's power could lead to biofuel-generating algae that are super-efficient, using a greater spread of sunlight than thought possible.
what is cosmophobia?
cosmophobia is an irrational fear that the world is about to end, and is sparked off by a belief among people that a cosmic end is near. the fear is ancient, and people have been readying for doom on and off - expecting floods, earthquakes, epidemics, drought, or even a collision with another planet. the latest bout was set off by the movie 2012, where the mayan calendar counts december 21, 2012 as the last day. earlier, the 2000 millennium frenzy had everyone believe that the end was near. for ages now, there have been apocalyptic predictions which have fuelled cosmophobia, but until now, they have all come to nought.
