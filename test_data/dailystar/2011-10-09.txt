competition yes, confrontation no
in a democracy, it is for political parties to go to the people every time they need public support for their programmes. it is on the degree of public support that parties are able to assess the acceptability or otherwise of their policies. but when political parties come up with programmes distinctly confrontational in nature, there is real cause for concern. the decision by the ruling awami league to counter the upcoming programmes of the opposition bnp is, we believe, a move it could well have done without. coming on the heels of the opposition's planned road marches and rallies, the ruling party's decision looks deliberately confrontational and does nothing to bridge the widening chasm between it and its political rivals. we are constrained to say that such an approach can hardly be constructive for the nation.
