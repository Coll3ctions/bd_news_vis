we welcome the decision of the caretaker government to enact laws to bar the corrupt, the loan defaulters, criminals, and those convicted by the court from par-ticipating in the forthcoming elections.
dhaka college incident
what happened in and around dhaka college on sat-urday should not have come to pass. in an unfortunate accident, a speeding microbus had hit a student while he was crossing the road in front of the college and in the process received grievous injury. we are sorry to hear that the student’s legs were fractured and needed hospitalisation for treatment. by all means, he must be given all sorts of medical and financial assistance by the government and the college authorities for his recovery and rehabilitation.
the brouhaha over a trifle
the caretaker government's dialogue with political stakeholders is tapering towards a denouement, with an odd few still opting out of it. the bnp, with a bruised image and wobbly organisation, has preferred to reject both the dialogue and the election unless its supremo is unconditionally freed from her incarceration.
the electric vehicle solution
a massive transportation crisis is growing in south asian cities, marked by high congestion, heavy pollution, and chaotic, unsafe traffic. this is lowering the quality of life in three ways, besides contributing massively to climate change -- the gravest threat humanity faces today.

they seem an odd couple: the general who engineered president bush's surge in iraq, and the presidential candidate who has promised to undo it. but look again. gen. david petraeus's broad new agenda as the likely next commander of central command (centcom), which oversees us forces in the entire middle east and central asia, seems to echo some of barack obama's views about the critical front in afghanistan and pakistan. view the page sports

kumar, ajanta sl stars
kumar sangakkara hit a fighting hundred and spinner ajantha mendis took four wickets to power sri lanka to a 64-run win over pakistan in their asia cup super league clash here on sunday.
tigers in 'what if' phase
in a history of bangladesh's glorious "what ifs" (read: fatullah, multan), the mirpur odi, where they let india off the hook after having them at 144 for 5 chasing 251, is one of the less documented ones. bangladesh were at the best of their cricketing form, india at their worst in recent times. a few less-than-prudent captaincy moves and poor fielding lost them a match that they dominated for 80% of the duration. bangladesh have only gone downhill since, and india have not looked back. the sense of "what if" still haunts from the mirpur match.

tourism
nowadays, tourism has become an industry all over the world. tourism can go a long way to developing our country. bangladesh has a golden opportunity to earn from this unexplored sector. and naturally our country is endowed with enchanting beauty having a colourful landscape. we have the world's largest sea beach, the sundarbans, hill tracts of chittagong and sylhet, mighty rivers, bay of bengal etc. as a result, tourists from every corner of the world visit our country.
ssc results
it is a matter of great hope that our 'public exam results' are getting better day by day. owing to the great care taken by the teachers, guardians and well wishers, students are doing well. but i think 'some students' of 'some institutions' are getting some special benefits. i am a student of dhaka university. i am doing my m.a in english. like most of the students, i also do tuition. from my experience, i can say that there must have been something wrong in 'some special schools'. i taught some students who, i think, never deserved a+. but they have got it. how? from the school they are supplied with very 'short suggestions'. those students devour them & get all the questions at the exam hall!
voter list
the ec has by now perhaps made available the correct and updated voter list to the intending candidates of the 4 city corporation and 9 municipal bodies. besides the voter list, the ec has an authenticated version of the voter list with photo. this would be used to verify the genuine voter by looking at the photo. the voter list with photo will not be available for general use, if i have understood the ec correctly. the political parties and the candidate will only get the voter list without photo.
vital issues
now food inflation rate has risen to about 18%. no doubt food inflation is the main obstacle to achieving mdgs. every year 30 lakh people are added to the population. this burgeoning population leads to depletion of farmland. unplanned industrialisation and urbanisation is another cause behind depletion of farmland. but these two major issues are not included in prsp draft which aims to halve the extreme poverty by 2015.
spelling
in our country, when we write bangla words in english language, we do follow the british style of writing. why? why do we write comilla, jessore, sylhet, etc. instead of cumilla, joshore & sylet.
death of a tiger
while visualising a royal bengal tiger, the picture i get is deadly and ferocious. but the news published in the daily prothom alo on 22nd june 2008 showed me something else: a tiger taking shelter on the roof of a village hut. its eyes were baffled and the ferocity was replaced by abysmal fear for life. we came to know that the tiger killed three people in the village of dakkhin kadamtala in satkhira. so, to “avenge” the deaths it was killed and hung on a tree. reading this in various newspapers, i had the following questions: 1) why did the tiger come to the village? 2) when the tiger was already captured, was it really necessary to kill it? and 3) what is the rule for similar situations? the answer to the first question is easy as we all know that generally a tiger does not come out of forests to take a 'morning walk'. it came to the village because it could not find any food in its habitat.
justice
when no conventional laws exist in a society, when people are corrupt in every way - at times there will be people who will come forward and do justice in a non-conventional ways. think about our country when the bnp, the al and the jp were in power and involved in corruption, nobody, not even the civil society, came forward to protest it. there were individual efforts, but no collective one.
why this u-turn?
i cannot but appreciate mr. nayem jafar of new jersey, usa, for the opinion he expressed about the u-turn the ctg has taken about political bigwigs in recent days and then i also thought against whom the corruption charges are left to be levelled ? for only the small fries of society? well, it seems everything is fine in the political melodrama. people by and large liked the action the government had taken against corruption at the initial stage. and if they found it difficult to hold trial for such massive loot & plunder, they could seek the public mandate for such action and set an example for the future generation.
learning english
i read with interest the letter written by mr. kamaluddin ahmed under the heading "teaching english", published in your issue of 25 june 2008. my observation on the subject is as follows:
rickshaw issue
this three wheeled vehicle was seen in many countries in the past. but it has been replaced gradually by different engine-driven vehicles. even pakistan was able to eliminate rickshaws from karachi and other main cities many years ago. yes, the rickshaw has two points in its favour. it needs no fuel, and so it is environment friendly.
rickshaws!
i would appeal to mr. sikander ahmed of gulshan whose letter was published in the daily star on april 16, 2008, that we all maintain calm and put comprehensive, collective and decisive thought into this very obvious problem of rickshaws in our city streets.
tarique's health
the internet edition of almost all the newspapers from bangladesh is raising a lot of hoopla about the deteriorating heath condition of the two ex- prime ministers. reluctantly, i am willing to grant them medical treatment of the highest quality in foreign land after all they led the nation with people's legitimate mandate. but there is no reason why tarique and arafat should be accorded the same treatment. they are no superior to any other citizen in a similar situation.
our tourist spot
in the latest seven wonders, cox's bazaar of bangladesh got the second position. if we want to select cox's bazaar for the final, we have to vote for it. we can easily cast our vote by www.new7wonders.com/nature or www.vote4bangladesh.com.
adding insult to injury!!
we have seen media reports quoting some "doctors" that tarique rahman's spinal problem is an old one.
pied pipers of bnp
abdul hafiz in his article on the subject published on 23 june has given a fair and pragmatic critical analysis of the bnp chairperson and her tunnel vision on all matters, except self! she is still hankering after the chair of bangladesh. the leader still leads the most transparently corrupt party in our political history, ably supported by the organised "lathials" of the jamaat, with access to "muscle" as and where needed!
lessons learned from 1/11
if you are one of the two party chiefs:
murky politics
1.tantrums of a former premier.
happy birthday!
happy birthday to the man who was arrested and imprisoned for life.
seedy greedy…
we are appalled at the greed of our “seedy ever needy” politicians. they are clamouring for the national election so that they are vaulted into power as soon as possible. they are absolutely allergic and sometimes antagonistic to local body election. incidentally, local body is the backbone of development in any developed and developing country. look at the usa, the uk, other eu countries, the philippines etc. strong local bodies like 'upazila' in our country form the very foundation of these countries. former president ayub khan is remembered for the historic muslim family law ordinance 1961 and president ershad for introduction of 'upazila system'. the bnp ruthlessly dismantled the best commendable work of ershad, the development friendly 'upazila system' out of vengeance and the awami league was afraid to hold local body elections. interest and welfare of the people should be the top priority, not 'barking' of politicians.
a hapless girl
