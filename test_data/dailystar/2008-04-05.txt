rising food prices: is there a solution on the horizon?

use and abuse of democracy
bangladesh and the united states of america are likely to go to polls at the end of this year. in the usa voters might be in the mood to try something historic. it is hard to remember a time when a black american has been in such a prime political position. barack obama is the first black american candidate to have serious chance of winning the presidency. unsurprisingly, in bangladesh we are perhaps going to witness business usual once again. a majority of our politicians from both the major parties are considered loyal sycophants. perhaps they are waiting in the forlorn hope that their leaders will be released from prison soon and make the politics of bangladesh business as usual. their excessive optimism and naive idealism suggest that they are still in love with the past politics. they are interested for next election only, but not for next generation.

is restriction on construction enough to protect st. martin's biodiversity?
st. martin's island -- the only island in bangladesh supporting coral reef-like ecosystem and coral-associated flora and fauna -- was declared by the government as an ecologically critical area (eca) in 1999. the island has undergone dramatic changes in recent years particularly in the development of local tourism and sale of landed properties. even after almost ten years of getting protected status the island has yet to see major interventions by the government to protect and conserve the ecosystem and ecological functions that govern the island and near-shore marine ecosystem. corals and coral-associated flora and fauna form a unique and vital part of this near-shore marine ecosystem. the national conservation strategy implementation project-1 (ncsip-1) developed a management plan for the island in 1996-97. as a follow-up st. martin's island biodiversity conservation and eco-tourism development project (smbcedp) was implemented by the ministry of environment & forest during 2000-2007 by the government's own revenue budget. the smbcedp collected huge information on the island and near-shore marine biodiversity and also initiated several activities for the conservation and management of the fragile island ecosystem. the results of the said project still remain to be made public.

'new styles of architecture, a change of heart'
the present title alludes to w.h. auden's poem ˜petition' in which the poet-turned-oxford-professor urges to 'publish each healer that in city lives'. the recent issue of jamini on 'the new architecture' has a similar conviction. in a brisk survey of the recent architecture in bangladesh, kazee khaleed ashraf-- jamini’ s guest editor for this issue--and his co-writer marina tabassum forward a petition for an 'urgent architectural intervention' to stem the rot in our urban landscape. the lack of vision on the part of the city-fathers as well as the profit motive of owners and developers is duly blamed for the 'catastrophic nature of the urban environment'. in addition, ashraf and tabassum frankly admit that the 'large scale building enterprises triggered by a globalized economy and vying for an international standard' has become 'the order of the day'. the new generation of architects mentioned in the article offers a pleasant respite from the 'real- estate equation'. the construction of 'the gardens in the air' by the green architect rafiq azam, the poetic adoption of space after char-bagh by the urbana architects kashef mahboob chowdhury and marina tabbassum, the creation of 'bengali moodiness' by uttam kumar shaha are mentioned among others who manifest the new styles of architecture, heralding a change of heart.
kali o kolom fifth anniversary issue
it is hard to believe that the fifth anniversary issue of kali o kolom is out, that five years have rolled by since the country's premier literary journal started its journey. congratulations are in order, not only for having displayed the stamina required to prevail over such a period (a year is usually an eon in terms of a literary journal), but for the continuing excellence of its issues. kali o kolom goes from strength to strength, as is amply demonstrated in this volume. it begins with hasan azizul haq's poignant account of his childhood in the depths of rural bengal that provides an unforgettable picture of the country as it was during the 1930s and ends 335 pages later with an essay on rokeya begum. in between is the usual cornucopia of articles, short stories, poems (a section which is particularly strong in this issue, with some major poets weighing in), novellas, nonfiction, in memoriums which will occupy the chaitra days (and extending well into boishakh) of its devoted, intelligent and responsive readership.

the middle government is missing in bangladesh
government is the tool to implement the wishes and aspirations of the people mandated through the election under the stern eyes of the opposition and the accountability institutions of the state. with one tier steel-framed government the reality is bangladesh has no democracy. it is abused and reduced to bribe-taking and toll collection; check and balance is simply missing. accountability is only in the rolling tears of the hapless victims.
is musharraf toast?
the short answer is: yes. in war, the side losing the initiative risks defeat, especially when momentum shifts to the enemy. despite germany's spectacular victories from 1939-1941, paulus's surrender at stalingrad in february 1943 combined with the us entry into the war in december 1942 spelled hitler's doom.

in the world of a scholar-economist
rehman sobhan's role in bangladesh's history has by now certainly been assured. as one of the young economists who identified themselves with the growing calls for regional autonomy in east pakistan in the 1960s, he was one of the figures who played an instrumental role in the formulation of the six points. the rest, as they say, is known history. in post-liberation bangladesh, rehman sobhan played a significant role in the formulation of economic policy, a task that was certainly not made any easier given the politically and socially disturbed conditions following the end of the nine-month war in late 1971. those were tumultuous times, a period that tested the mettle of the political leadership as also of the intellectuals associated with the powers that be. sobhan was certainly a significant pivot in the bangladesh wheel at the time. he was, and remains, a formidable intellectual force in the country.
a young man in search of faith
as the name suggests, it is a book about the islamic community in britain. the west has long been intrigued by the islamists of asia and the middle east. set in the 1980s, the book will definitely quench the desire of those who wish to be enlightened about the radical islamists of asian origin. it is about a young muslim of bangladeshi origin, a british boy brought up in the uk. it aptly deals with his dilemma of being a bangladeshi as well as a briton at the same time. we have seen writers like monica ali, zadie smith and manzu islam dealing with bangladeshi second generation immigrants being torn apart by their need to hold on to the traditional values and the need to be assimilated in their new-found home. a very few writers have shed light on the history of young muslims turning into radical islamists.
moonlight that power does not let in
censorship of creative works, especially fiction, is alive and well in much of the non-western world. that said, it is no surprise that wolves of the crescent moon has been a threat to authorities in the kingdom of saudi arabia, yousef al-mohaimeed's native country. what a pity that this imaginative writer's novel cannot be read by the readers for whom it was intended. what a blessing that the translation into english is at least available for many of us, following the original publication of the arabic text (fikhakh al-ra'iha) in beirut. perhaps there is no better way to understand the zeitgeist of a given country than by examining the way it treats its artists.
commitment, or the life of an artist
hashem khan is known as a reputed painter in our country. he is also the author of quite a few informative books. most of the books are related to art and painting. zainul abediner sharajiban is one such work, where we are brought in touch with zainul abedin's life and the circles within which it moved. the book, in addition to focusing on the artist's life, looks at zainul abedin as a teacher, organiser, patriot, curator and above all a good human being.

adorn publication
the narrative is in the third person and speaks of the mysteries and experiences the author went through what was an observant boyhood. in more than one sense, it is also a depiction of geography which soon expands into an exposition of heritage in times that are no more. a strong whiff of the fictional is here.
