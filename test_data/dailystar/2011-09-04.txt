road crashes on holidays
no fewer than thirty-eight people have died and eighty others have been injured in road accidents during the eid holidays. the argument could be made that accidents do happen. but beating that argument is another, which is that it is unusual for accidents to occur at a time when roads are relatively free of the usual congestion and frenzy which might cause tragedy and lead to unexpected deaths. on holidays, therefore, it is not expected that buses will turn over and cars crash into all sorts of objects.

flimsy international laws
a spectacular revolution has overthrown gaddafi's government in libya. a very well-equipped civilian population engaged in armed battles against the army for 6 months. it's evident, conceded in many cases, that france, uk and the usa armed civilians and parachuted weapons to rebel groups (the guardian, uk, june 30, 2011) though mr. obama recently started denying it. nato even provided naval support for the flank attack on tripoli. i draw your attention to the 'legality' (or the lack thereof) of arming civilian populations - regardless the end. the actions violated the un arms embargo on libya, not to mention - the country's sovereignty. in this era of ends justifying means, international courts, laws and conventions will bend over backwards for the rich or well-represented nations.
