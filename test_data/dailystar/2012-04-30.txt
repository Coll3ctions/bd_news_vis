when business people buy their security

drought-and-flood- tolerant rice
we have learnt from a news report that department of agricultural extension has taken a scheme to distribute 450 tonnes of seeds of high-yielding drought-tolerant rice named nerica among farmers in 30 districts for sowing in 18,500 acres of land. however, nerica is a cross between an african variety and a high-yielding asian one, developed by the scientists of west africa rice development association. bangladesh brought nerica from uganda in 2009 and it underwent adaptive trials in selective fields. nerica has the strength to survive in drought up to 21 days and matures in 100 days. it can be grown in all crop seasons- aus, aman and boro. in fact, the scope for good rice harvesting in aus season has increased through this scheme. we know once 'aus' was the second biggest crop of the country. so this is a good initiative no doubt for this particular season in the uplands.

very often the pm is found to accuse bnp or its leader khaleda zia that 'when the bnp was in power, they did not think of doing good for the country or its people; they only indulge in looting and making fortunes for themselves.' her utterances only demonstrate her political immaturity, for people know that whoever is at the helm would blow her own trumpet. there are allegations against the bnp that they committed many misdeeds, but the assertion that it did not work for the people is ridiculous.

the endless chase
a cloud of uncertainty has started to gather over the political horizon. the government and the opposition bangladesh nationalist party (bnp) are again on a collision course over the disappearance of ilias ali, bnp's organising secretary, on april 17. as the government could not find ilias ali by saturday's deadline, the opposition has made good on its threat to launch what it termed a tougher movement by enforcing two more days of hartal , with attending violence, deaths, burnt vehicles and vandalism. and as always, at the ultimate receiving end are the public.
who abducted ilias ali?
for the last one week or so, the nation has been kept hostage for exercising the "democratic" right of the opposition at the expense of the fundamental rights of the citizens. the issue is the disappearance of a bnp central leader, ilias ali. in the process, in addition to the loss of state and private properties, three individuals of his party and two bystanders lost their lives. i did not know that ilias ali was a leader of bnp. to me he was a bnp newsmaker in sylhet politics because of the feud among different camps within his party.
