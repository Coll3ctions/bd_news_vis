hartals punishing citizens
bnp chairperson khaleda zia has exhorted her party leaders and workers to be prepared for a longer movement against the government. the bnp's ire has to do with the prime minister's taking a stand recently against a continuation of the caretaker system following a supreme court judgement on the matter. sheikh hasina has since softened her stance by publicly asking the bnp to make its own position known in the jatiyo sangsad. her unambiguous statement that nothing one-sided will be done should have been taken advantage of by the bnp. unfortunately, by opting for yet another hartal and implying that there will be more, the opposition has only contributed to a muddying of the waters.

economic terrorism?
after watching the headlines of the tv channels i came to know that bnp and jamaat-e- islami again called a countrywide dawn-to-dusk hartal on 12th and 13th june with a view to protesting the cancellation of the caretaker government system. i think hartal is not the legal way to stop the amendment on the caretaker government provision.
publish results in time
the government and the education ministry always neglect us who are studying in the national university. even in the recent budget 2011-12, our finance minister gave emphasis only on primary and secondary education. we are the students of session 2008-2009. after our admission three years have passed, but yet we have not got our first year results. how many days do the authorities need to publish the results? they must remember that most of the students are from the middle class background that needs jobs urgently to support their families. we would draw the kind attention of our honorable prime minister, education minister and the nu authorities to free us from this session jam and publish the results in time so that we can have a hassle free, smooth educational life.

investment of undisclosed income in shares
we thank the government for taking the decision of not increasing or imposing new taxes and not making tin mandatory for the bo account holders. this will have positive impact on the capital market. the capital market needs more investment, mainly from the financial institutions and business communities. we should encourage them to invest in shares. the government can play a leading role in this area. this will definitely improve the status of the capital market. we strongly urge the ministry of finance to allow investment of undisclosed income in purchase of shares of listed companies by adding section 19d of income ordinance 1984 in budget fy 2011-12.

multipolar world and bangladesh
the multipolar world has become a global reality. nearly twenty years have passed since the collapse of the soviet union and the end of us-ussr bipolar world order. the leaders of the four fast growing economies grouped under bric (brazil, russia, india, and china) want their own respective roles in the world economy. brazil and india also want their economic presence reflected in permanent membership of the un where china and russia already have permanent seats. other major emerging economies, such as south korea and south africa also want to play a role in global politics. the global economy is going through a rapid change and the centre of the world both economically and strategically is shifting to the east, mainly asia.
bnp should act wisely
we have become very frustrated by the attitude of our politicians. it is surprising that what common people can easily predict, they fail to see. we all know that bnp's demand for a mid term election will never be realized. awami league-led government will not step down, the sun may rise in the west but stepping down by the present government will never happen. so, our question to the bnp is why they are wasting breath on an issue that is futile. bnp should concentrate on other issues which are making life difficult for the people and compel the government to solve the problems.
stock and share
in the present day culture we become used to share market intelligence. almost regularly we find news in both print and electronic media regarding fall or even crash in stock prices. recently one young reader of my articles in the newspaper requested me to write something drawing the distinctions between 'stock' and 'share'.
i am better…
there is a problem in our local politics, it's like a disease. no, i'm not talking abut 'blame game'. obviously 'blame game' has always been there. i'm talking about the 'superiority complex'. each one thinks he is better than the other. it's like claiming, "shob paji khali ami valo"; when in reality not one of the major two groups can prove itself better than the other. both prefer 'hartal' as a way to voice their opinion against government's activities while going to the parliament is a way better option. none thinks constructively, both like destruction.
no scope for dialogue!
bnp chief begum khaleda zia in a recent press conference said, "caretaker government will stay; there is no need or scope for dialogue". she extended her order and asked the present government to resign, as if she is the supreme authority of bangladesh and everything should move as she dictates and all others are to follow orders. but she did not specify to whom this government should submit the resignation and handover power.
replace the word 'shood'
the word 'shood' is grossly misunderstood, misinterpreted and is being used as a religio-political weapon by vested interested parties with ulterior motives. 'shood' literally means profit or dividend. but an age-old stigma is attached to the word 'shood' because of money lending business. what has been prohibited in islam is the practice of 'usury' which is comparable with 'dadon' or 'mohajani' business in our country. in dadon or mohajani business, the borrower is forced to pay around ten percent interest per month which amounts to 120 percent per year. as an alternative, the borrower is forced to surrender a fixed part of his crop yield or fish yield to the mahajan. islam has categorically prohibited this practice. nowadays, because of accounting, administrative complications, etc., banks and other financial institutions fix up a rate of return for a certain period, and that return is commonly called 'shood'. this practice and the very word 'shood' is misinterpreted by so-called islamic banks and cunningly used as a tool. they also fan up religious sentiments among the muslims on this issue. (i found the interest rates of islamic banks are the highest. they only use catchy arabic words to attract the depositors) in the above context, i call upon the government, banks, financial institutions etc. to discontinue using the word 'shood” and replace it by dividend or 'labbhangsha'.
for a peaceful bangladesh
as a bangladeshi i feel proud for my country and also for awami league government. this party is known as a secular party. often anti-liberation groups raise their angry voices against secularism. so, it is the duty of awami league to make bangladesh a better place for all castes and creeds.
it's better late than never
a news item published in a national daily of june 8 that the shoura council of saudi arabia recommended to government to take necessary measures to allow saudi women to vote in municipal elections. of course it is encouraging news for the saudi women as well as the women who are deprived of their voting rights in many societies of the world in the name of islam. it may be noted that if the islamic codes are interpreted partially, it may create misconceptions among people about islam.
wasting money on cell phones
in north america, getting a mobile phone number is as difficult as getting a visa or master card. before allowing a mobile phone number, the serving company does a complete credit check of the applicant and after being fully satisfied, the applicant gets a connection, unlike pakistan, where you just walk into an outlet, grocery store or a paan-cabin and buy a sim. view the page international
