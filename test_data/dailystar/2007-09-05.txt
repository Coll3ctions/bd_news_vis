bnp's most serious crisis
begum khaleda zia's arrest on monday was clearly a major blow for the bangladesh nationalist party. what, however, came as a new blow was the peremptory manner in which the bnp chairperson announced the expulsion of party secretary general abdul mannan bhuiyan from the party. if the first blow was precipitated by the anti-corruption commission's case against begum zia, the second was brought about by the harsh move of the former prime minister herself. to what extent the bnp will handle this twin crisis is something that political observers will be watching keenly. and that is only natural, given that the occupants of the two most powerful positions in the party are now positioned against each other.

words, phrases and our political lexicon
there is a lot you hear about something called indoor politics these days. and you begin to wonder what it all means. politics, after all, is just that -- politics. it is either there or it isn't. again, if you speak of indoor politics, it naturally follows that there is another phenomenon known as outdoor politics.

diarrhoea patients
i am distressed to see the record increase in the number of diarrhoea patients at the cholera hospital in dhaka seeking emergency treatment. i had the opportunity of dealing with several such surges while i was working at the cholera research laboratory/ icddr,b between 1966-1986. here are my suggestions for controlling the number of new admissions to the hospital(s); if it has not been done already:
razzaq quits
abdul razzaq's sudden departure from international cricket is a big loss to both cricket as well as the pakistan team. he was undoubtedly an amazing all-rounder, although i always felt that his bowling at times looked sluggish but his pinch-hitting style batting has always been a treat to watch. his unexpected retirement comes at a time when pakistan are looking to re-build their team after the world cup debacle and also at a time when a new coach has just arrived. i would blame the selectors here because razzaq has made it clear that the reason behind his retirement is that the selectors did not include him in the 15-man squad heading for the twenty20
polythene bag
i was watching on television the news of relief distribution among the flood victims. the thing is that flood victims were being provided the relief goods contained in polythene bags. apart from this, even if we look around our markets we will find that the existence of polythene bag is still there and we all are using this bag. this is needless to say yet again that polythene is an utterly detrimental thing for the environment. many campaigns were launched to prevent the citizens from using the polythene bag and an effective attempt was made to encourage people to use paper, cloth, and jute made bags instead of using polythene bags.
tragic realism?
in literature, the term for unlikely events juxtapositioned into reality is called magic realism. great authors have used this concept in many of their masterpieces. the books that twine together the real with the unreal often satirically speak of the nature of society. in correspondence to politics and governance in bangladesh, the unbelievable information that is being stripped and exposed is indeed real, but the extent of these events is unbelievable. the events compiled together speak in the tone of an unpublished magically real story, where the plot is being unfolded. unfortunately, this is a true tale where the bottom line had been leading to spoil the values of the country.
student politics
i think it is always good to discuss about our own country. many men have many minds. i oppose student politics. i came to know what they actually do when i was a resident of sir salimullah hall in du. student activists do virtually nothing.
party politics and columnists
be careful about our think tanks (empty?) who would try to write articles terming the present chaotic situation as mass movement. don't you think it is high time to ban party politics from educational institutes and trade unions?
no sympathy for troublemakers
i had a stressful evening when i learned from my sister (a du student) that they would have to vacate the hall. she had to walk a long way to reach my aunt's house. she paid the price of her university mates' unruly destructive behaviour. i have no sympathy for the students who created anarchy even after the government expressed regret and withdrew the army camp from dhaka university. i will not be surprised if the employers now even more favour private university students over public university ones.
destructive student politics
we the overseas bangladeshis are shocked and ashamed of the unruly behaviour of our student community presumably fumed by certain teachers of dhaka university. instead of supporting the present caretaker government for its good intention to clean up the image of the world's most corrupt country, they are indulging in politics of destruction.
much better now!
i just came back from visiting dhaka for two weeks in the middle of august. for the last one year, i have been following the events through your newspaper but this is the first time i had a first-hand experience of how life is in dhaka. i am glad to say that whatever i saw was very encouraging. i was so glad to see so many positives in the daily lives of our families. to begin with, the airport experience was a breath of fresh air, everything was clean and orderly. i didn't see a single person around who had no reason to be there. i felt secured and safe when i was inside and when i got out. the streets were cleaner than last year when i last visited dhaka. i also experienced much less traffic congestion.

status of biogas technology in bangladesh

politics overheating in pakistan
for any political observer the developments in pakistan are at once interesting and dull. interesting because new actors are in the play and dull because it is repetition of history. over the past several weeks there have been a series of reports that a power-sharing deal is in the making between gen pervez musharraf and former prime minister benazir bhutto. now there is another twist -- that of another former prime minister nawaz sharif -- who is threatening to return to pakistan to oust musharraf.
