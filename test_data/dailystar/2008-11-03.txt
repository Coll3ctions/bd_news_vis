what are political parties offering the voters?
with the election knocking at the door, political parties are yet to unravel their plans and programmes for serving the people. completely oblivious to and unrepentant about what they had done to derail democracy they seem to be unprepared to address the problems of the day. to say the least, they made a farce of governance and rule of law, and concomitantly the nation was subjected to political, ethical and moral erosion of massive magnitude. the real issues facing the nation were subsumed in endless confrontation and battles of attrition between major political parties. but there is no sign that they have become wiser. on the contrary, today they make attempts to create new issues and talk about political movement as if living in the past.
november 3, 1975 and our brave leaders

obamania and the r word
with the us elections a few days away, barack obama looks to have sewn it up. every major poll indicates obama's victory, with some polls showing a seemingly insurmountable double- digit lead. the key factor is that swing states like colorado, ohio, and florida, all with large electoral votes and having voted republican in the previous two elections, seem to be “swinging” in obama's favour.

reformatting global system
these are some of the regulatory "quick fixes", on which there is already broad agreement. but they amount to little more than band-aids applied to the gaping holes created or at least exposed by the crisis, and such band-aid solutions are clearly inadequate to prevent the next crisis. and in the wake of a crisis of this magnitude, we can no longer say that the financial system basically works, as long as we apply some regulatory tweaking. we may need to rethink the entire global financial architecture - literally, from its foundations to its roof - to prevent financial turbulence from wreaking such havoc on the world in future. indeed, president bush recently invited the g20 to a summit on november 15 to discuss the crisis, and some have argued that this meeting should consider reforming that global architecture. what, then, are some of the principles and policy ideas that could guide such a reform?

doctor, not quite!
last week, my mother took my aunt to get a regular dental check-up in a hospital. she told the doctor about the severe and unbearable pain in her molar tooth. the doctor examined the tooth for a couple of minutes or so and finally gave the prescription. he told that he had to remove that tooth at once which simply scared my aunt horribly. to add more to her fears he said that if it was not removed as soon as possible the other teeth might need to be removed as well. after reaching home, my mother tried her best to console her but all her attempts went futile. she suggested that we consult another doctor before taking any hasty decisions but my aunt was stubborn. next day she had her operation. all went well for three days. on the fourth day her tooth started paining. when it was unbearable, my mother and me took her to another hospital. after examining for half an hour or so, the doctor asked the reason for removing the tooth. we explained to him. after taking some tests he told us that the tooth for which she was suffering was left untouched. giving a sigh he told us that the doctor had removed one of her good teeth! after hearing that mother and me stared at the doctor for a couple of minutes open-mouthed. she was suffering from pain because a bone got stuck in her tooth. he has removed it and soon she will start smiling. he prescribed some medicines and then he bid us farewell.
