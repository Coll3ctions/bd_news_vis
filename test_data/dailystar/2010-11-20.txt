bailing out irish economy
the republic of ireland seems to be in a crisis of historic proportions. for its banking system has lost confidence of the depositors and the government has already bankrolled to the tune of $60 billion to bail them out. as it happened in the usa in 2008 when the us government had to come to the rescue of the bankrupt financial institutions and big businesses, so it is now the turn of the irish government to save its financial institutions with the taxpayers' money. but the government already facing a huge budgetary deficit is not in a position to shoulder the burden alone. which is why it is now in need of external assistance to get over the crisis.

role in equity, research and science diplomacy
the flag, which shows a variation of the parthenon, the ancient greek temple located in athens, is readily recognised as the symbol of unesco. it contributes to peace and security by promoting international collaboration through education, science, and culture in order to further universal respect for justice, the rule of law and human rights, along with fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the un charter. to quote irina bokova, the first woman director-general of unesco: "unesco was born from a simple idea. since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed. . . the new context demands that the conditions necessary for mutual understanding and peace-building be rethought. we must build a lasting universal human community, drawing on the fundamental values of humanity, and first and foremost on the resources of the mind. these are the stakes of this new humanism, where unesco has a leading role to play."

china relents but cannot stop north korea from weapon proliferation
north korea's nuclear weapons development programme has remained a worry for the world. global efforts to rein in pyongyang have yielded little results and the 'rogue' state continues to defy the world. what moreover worries the rest of the world is north korea's support for syria, myanmar, iran and pakistan in their nuclear weapons development programmes. the only country, china, which can probably halt pyongyang's nuclear programme and its support to other countries, continues to remain a suspect in its sincerity to do so.

the power of eloquence in history . . .
oratory has since the beginning of civilised existence kept people in thrall. shakespeare provided a clue to the riveting nature of speeches in his plays. you think here of brutus and mark antony in julius caesar, of the many ways in which they played with words to convince the audience of the justness of the causes they held dear. but that was literature. in life lived from day to day, through the vagaries of politics, oratory has often been raised to the level of art. in bangladesh's case, the speeches of sheikh mujibur rahman were ammunition, over the years, in the defence of liberty. gandhi was not a rousing speaker, but the calm religiosity he brought into his words drove the point home. and then there was syed badrudduja, whose command of bengali, urdu and english was demonstrated to huge effect in his speeches, particularly in pre-partition india.
a writer's world
writers are supposed to be lonely people, living in a world of their own. indeed, even in a crowded place the writer will seem to have little touch with all that is going around him. he will be in another world, a world of his own. people all around seem to be irrelevant to the imaginative world in which the writer is absorbed. his world is inhabited by imagination. the imaginative characters are at times worldly people but on others they are wild and totally out of this world. demons and monsters, kings and queens, witches and wizards --- all crowd the imaginative world of the writer. in the real world the writer may be a lonely soul but in this world of imagination he is the king all his creations. he is surrounded by crowds, screaming, laughing or whispering in thousands of voices.
