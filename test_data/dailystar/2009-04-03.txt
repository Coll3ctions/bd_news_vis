glimpses of positive sign on manpower front
over these past many years, thousands of our workers who have either not been able to go abroad or have been compelled to return home by the host countries have spoken of their travails brought on by unscrupulous agencies, especially at home but also abroad. in light of what has lately been happening to bangladesh's workers in certain countries, these realities take on added significance. and now that none other than expatriates welfare minister khondokar mosharraf hossain has spoken of the nefarious roles played by brokers in the manpower business, it is proper to ask what happens from here on.

back in 1968, field marshal mohammad ayub khan was in terrific form. he celebrated the tenth year of his seizure of power through a frenzy of exhibition as well as exhibitionism. in what used to be east pakistan, sheikh mujibur rahman was already in deep trouble, or so the president's people thought, with the agartala case looming large over his future. the future, as ayub saw it, was safe. maybe even assured. view the page sports

trial of war criminals
it was very disturbing to listen to two distinguished lawyers on channel -i on trial of war criminals. the process adopted so far is failing due to reasons one can easily understand listening to these two lawyers and also international reaction to the approach taken by the government as mentioned by the law minister. he needs to be more firm and proactive. the ministry should give a comprehensive legal framework to proceed with the trial. if necessary, they should take legal opinion from experts.
save jute
jute, the golden fibre of bangladesh, is now disappearing and going to get its place in museum within a very short time like maslin. nowadays farmers are not interested in cultivating jute due to various reasons.
smoking in public places
we have already forgotten that smoking in public places had been banned by the awami league government long ago, during its first tenure of governance. in that period the law was sometimes enforced by law enforcers and tnos by apprehending smokers at public places and penalizing them tk 50.00 on the spot. it is a matter of great regret that smoking in public places once again started in violation of the rules since the bnp government came to power in 2001.
global economic recession
today's world is integrated with product and market due to globalisation. very few countries have lowered barriers to international trade in the era of globalisation. the global economic slow-down has drastic consequences on developing countries like bangladesh. the countries that were dependent on the usa, eu and japan as export markets for their products and tourism faced severe constraints in maintaining their growth and economic levels. this in turn adversely affected foreign exchange earnings, employment generation, and govt. tax revenues in developing countries.
power failure

now we are living in a modern age, but are we really modern? we saw a devastating fire in bsec bhaban in 2007 and now the fire at bashundhara city has once again exposed our weakness in fighting a big fire.
working beyond office time
we have started to adopt a new culture in the corporate world in most organisations and institutions. a common practice is often seen that we have a tendency to stay late in the office, only to display sincerity, loyalty and commitment “that spells out work within 9 to 5 is not adequate, i need more time for my workload.” i once had an occasion to work with a british consultant who mentioned that office timings have been fixed within adequate space and time to complete a day's work, if you are unable to complete your work, it proves you are inefficient. if i want to apply this principle commonly, that would incriminate that most of our mid level and senior executives are inefficient.
cricket and security
most of the countries like australia and england always raise questions about security in the sub-continent.
eu report on polls
the european union election observation mission in its final report on dec 29 polls recommended that the ec make a provision so that a candidate could not seek election from more than one seat to create a level playing field for everyone and avoid costly by-elections. this is a good recommendation. but as an ordinary citizen of the country, i recommend one more thing for the next election. better managing initiatives have to be taken for receiving the result sheets and used election materials.
pay commission
notwithstanding a healthy proposal to raise the salary of government ombudsmen each year, we hardly see its reflection in practice. so to say, every government until now paid no attention to fixing up a permanent pay commission. for those who want to live honestly, a good salary structure is necessary. but nobody seems to understand the simple truth!
curse of corruption
each & every sector of the govt. is corrupt and no work is possible without payment of graft--particularly lower grade employees & non-gazetted officials are experts in realising money from their clients through various tactics. their demands are 15-20% higher than the govt. taxes & fees. they seem to have become more emboldened after the massive crackdown by the last ctg on corruption.
a forgotten veteran
tahmina khan dolly, the first woman ambassador of bangladesh to sri lanka, is suffering from amnesia and passing her days in the care of some doctors in a local private hospital away from media attention. mrs. khan does not need any financial assistance but needs attention of her party members, as she has dedicated most of her life to the party. she was made an ambassador by president ziaur rahman for her hard work, efficiency and competency. she was involved in politics wholeheartedly and was a very dedicated party member even after the death of ziaur rahman. mrs. khan's contribution to the bnp is invaluable without any doubt.
meeting of twoleaders
once again some economists and political experts have started talking about a possible meeting between the two top leaders of the country. veteran personalities like dr. akbar ali khan, prof. mozaffar hossain, rashed khan menon and some leaders of two political parties have emphasized the necessity of the meeting to face the challenges of present global economic recession that may affect bangladesh.
slow moving bureaucracy
the prime minister's pledge to bring changes and create a digital bangladesh is being thwarted by an unwilling bureaucracy. this is the realization of the pm herself. the top bureaucrats met the pm to assure her of their sincerity. perhaps the government will feel assured and continue its effort to appease the hierarchy.
state of the nation
on the eve of our 38th independence day, it is relevant to look at the state of our country now that the 'honeymoon' period (100 days) of the new awami league led grand alliance is almost over. in this, the al's third innings, the second by an overwhelming majority, what is the position of the juicy pre-election promises?
western hypocrisy
