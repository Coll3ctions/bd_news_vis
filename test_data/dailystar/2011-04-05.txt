the difference between the indian team that won the world cup in 1983 and the one in 2011 is an uncomplicated one: the economy. the 1983 victory was a consequence of talent, extraordinary self-belief and some luck. in 2011 the indian cricket team is by far the richest eleven in the game, sucking the oxygen out of other sports, a template for ambition in homes across the small cities that will become the delhis and mumbais of tomorrow, a magnet for middle class and rural india which understands that the distance from obscurity to superstardom is a game that bypasses the educational demands of conventional professional upward mobility, and fetches rewards quite outside the zone of merit and salary.
crossing threshold of diplomatic norms
the united states has come up with a categorical statement telling the bangladesh government what it should do and to whose satisfaction on the yunus issue. the us assistant secretary of state has said that if a compromise was not reached on the yunus issue, us-bangladesh relationship would get "impacted." "we in the united states have been deeply troubled by the difficulties he is currently facing," he told the media. this is probably the most apocalyptic public statement we have ever heard involving two sovereign "partners in development." the intimidation came at time when bangladesh was all prepared to celebrate her 40th year of independence.

neanderthals could control fire
it is believed that the neanderthals, our ancient of ancestors, were somewhat brainless dummies and in accordance with that notion, this extinct member of homo-genus have been portrayed as brutes. but a new research has shown that our ancient human ancestors were able to control fire even on continuous basis which many experts believe as one of the most important milestones on the path ofcivilization some 400,000 years ago. this new research by the university of colorado (uoc) and leiden university, netherlands (lun), the details of which have been published in the march 14 issue of the proceedings of the national academy of sciences, concluded this finding after inspecting 141 ancient neanderthal excavation sites (dating from 1.2 million years to 35,000 years b.c) in europe. neanderthals, stockier than contemporary humans who still carry a small amount of neanderthal dna, once roamed europe and central asia. and also thought to have evolved in europe around 400,000 to 500,000 years ago and became extinct about 30,000 years ago. it is considered in the archeological community that the emergence of stone tool manufacturing and the control of fire are the two key hallmark events in the technological evolution of the early man. however, even though it is agreed that the origins of stone tools date back to some 2.5 million years ago the emergence of habitual fire control remains a highly debatable issue. but paolo villa, curator at the uoc's museum of natural history and prof. wil roebroeks of lun, both authors of the paper were on a mission to shed some light on the issue.
