withdrawal of "politically motivated" cases
we have been vigorously against the idea of sweepingly withdrawing cases instituted on so-called politically motivated grounds. we had reservations too about the "national committee on withdrawal of politically motivated cases." we are convinced that it was a patently wrong idea primarily because the merit of a case can only be determined by a judge in the court of law and not by a committee set up for this purpose. and our apprehensions have been borne out by the manner in which the matter has been dealt with. many cases have been withdrawn so far, on the recommendations of the district committees that display a high degree of political partisanship.
school textbooks on day one
the distribution of free textbooks for primary and secondary level students is happily underway. it is certainly commendable that in this particular sector, among some other sectors, the government has been demonstrating a degree of efficiency that could well be replicated in other areas. the textbook distribution programme is of particular significance because of fears lately expressed about some printers being unable to supply the books to schools in time for distribution. we are not suggesting that everything has turned out well with the inauguration of the distribution on saturday. but we have reasons to think, now that education minister nurul islam nahid has reassured us on this score, that students in the primary and secondary schools will have all their books in hand in the course of the next one week. the seriousness the minister and his department have consistently attached to the textbook issue convinces us that matters are under control. that is a far cry from the crises which earlier overwhelmed students and schools owing to uncertainty about the textbooks being available on schedule. view the page sports
