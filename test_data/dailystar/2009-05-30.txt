rally for rivers

after cyclone aila . . .
the severity of cyclone aila, which hit south-western bangladesh last week, is only now beginning to come into sharper focus. the number of the dead appears to be going up and is now close to two hundred. the damage caused to homesteads and crops has been serious enough to be compared to the loss caused by sidr in 2007. the state of things at present seems to be getting increasingly newer dimensions with every passing day. survivors have been left without food and drinking water. a very large number of them are marooned all across the region, with relief workers unable to reach them with the help they need. add to that the incidence of diseases, such as diarrhoea, which have been afflicting them.

conserving plant genetic resources at community level
a good part of villagers in bangladesh invest considerable time and energy in subsidiary economic gardening. this is often in the form of a vegetable garden and tree orchard on whatever household land is available to them. in fact this has been the mainstay both for the basic nutrition balance and the homestead forestry contribution of which in the rural economy and its well-being is well recognised. however, the practitioners of such gardening usually follow traditional technologies, and the absence of better seeds has been one of their acute problems. the extent of support services for farmers during the last decade in bangladesh has proved efficacious.
disposing of solid waste with prudence
generation of solid waste in voluminous amount in modern cities has multifarious environmental implications. so its management is one of major environmental concerns. municipal solid waste not only contains solid phase waste but also many semisolid or liquid, at times volatile substances. over time it degrades with action of microbes and creates nuisance to the citizens if not properly handled and disposed of. solid waste containing organic substances may pollute surface and ground water, air and soil, but can be very useful resource if properly managed.
cost effective, environment friendly boro rice cultivation
boro rice in bangladesh, either hyv (high yielding variety) or traditional variety covering more than 4.5 million ha, is entirely irrigated production, mostly with underground water. irrigation has become a very costly input in rice production because of increasing cost of fuel. farmers pay about 25-30% of the price of their harvest for irrigation. for producing 1 kg of paddy, it is estimated that a farmer has to use 3-4 thousand liters of water for maintaining pond water during the growing stage of plants. as a result, besides the increased cost of irrigation, groundwater level is also declining due to excessive withdrawal threatening the environment. therefore research has been conducted through brri-irri collaboration for long to develop water saving techniques in rice cultivation by the alternate wetting and drying (awd) method. view the page literature
a 'rat' encounter, or two...
my de-mystification process with the 'rat' began one afternoon during my phd studies at boston university in 1987. i knew the rat's location, and made my way from the graduate student office next to commonwealth avenue, continued along that thoroughfare, and then past another city landmark, kenmore square. the walk was all of five minutes, give or take a few seconds. it was the swansong of high summer, and the heat that day was oppressive, turning my t-shirt into virtually the outer skin of my sweating self.
kali o kolom jaishtha 1416 -- may 2009
football fans will know what i'm talking about when i say that sometimes even a much anticipated chelsea versus manchester united match in the english premier league can turn out to be a rather unexciting encounter, with ordinary dribbling and passing that is only enlivened momentarily with flashes of genuine footwork. so too with this issue of kali o kolom, where genuine inspiration lurks amid the mass of plodding literary essays. it is not the themes that are at fault here since they range from rabindranath to eminent historian/archeologist hassan dani and poetry written during the 1960s to communal disharmony. rather, it's the style of writing, which leads one to suspect that perhaps the magazine should be aware that 'literary' writing, like all other types of activities, too can fall into a rut. it is also a truism that serious essays for publication in literary journals that also aspire to popular readership can be difficult to produce on a consistent basis and that standard publications being brought out over the long term with deadlines to meet can mean that at times the match-up does not live up to its expectations - a sentiment that i'm fairly sure the editor of this particular page will also agree with! it is a fate that only the irregularly published little magazines can avoid, who can afford to wait until they have enough material they deem worthy of publication. and even then…
scenes from a graphic novel
a graphic novel is a 'novel' in a comic book form. its origins lie in the united states post-world war ii era of the pulp novel and the newspaper comic strip, which in turn gave rise to comic books. today that comic book form is no longer what most older generation figures will remember it to be. from the 1960s on it came under pressure for change came from the japanese 'manga' comic books, the increasing popularity of science fiction books and 'underground' comic cults. graphic novels are hugely popular in europe, with some favourite 'characters', even though they are american creations, far more familiar to european readers. as that change in the comic book character became pronounced, it was simply a matter of time before it incorporated the novel's themes and linear devices, with lengthy and complex storylines bound in durable formats. today graphic novels are hugely sophisticated in terms of themes and artwork qualities, with art spiegleman's work on the holocaust, titled maus: a survivor's tale receiving a special pulitzer prize in 1992. it is increasingly starting to gain acceptance among mainstream publishers and readers as something qualitatively different from being mere comic books. in this context john updike's words, when in 1969 he addressed the bristol literary society on “the death of the novel,” are much quoted: "i see no intrinsic reason why a doubly talented artist might not arise and create a comic strip novel masterpiece." last year a graphic novel on che guevara - 'che: a graphic biography' by spain rodriguez, published by last gasp - appeared to much acclaim.
