which economic model should bangladesh choose?
bangladesh stands at a crossroads; behind it lies its difficult economic past while ahead lies the promise of a much brighter future. however the route to that brighter future is by no means direct. bangladeshis must collectively decide how to get there. the west, led by america, offers one model of growth which is driven by the free market and mass consumption. essentially, this western model believes that individuals (either people or firms) should bear the risk -- and reward -- of success or failure. it espouses low taxes, few regulations and individual ownership of the factors of production. while this model certainly works, it works more for some than for others, generating a lot of inequality amid the wealth it creates. as one of my economics professors used to say “do not confuse efficiency with equality”.

the imf kicks in
there are two differing views about the present state of the economy of bangladesh. if you ask the government, the answer is that there are a few challenges which need to be addressed like inflation and dearth of liquidity in our banks. but we are on track. the economic indicators seem to say so. the next budget is being based on this optimism.
the ghalib guide to politics
who would you consider a better guide to contemporary politics: chaudhry birender singh, general secretary of the indian national congress with charge of delhi, uttarakhand and himachal pradesh, or mirza asadullah ghalib, urdu-persian poet-philosopher during the dusk of the mughal empire? the choice may not seem quite as obvious, on second glance. if you prefer the chaudhry, you are clearly reasonable. the mirza, however, might be a more illuminating guide during periods of great existential strain.
multifaceted benefits of bilingualism
bangladesh is the motherland of the international mother language day. english is widely used in this country because of its colonial history. there are some people here who speak urdu and there are also many indigenous languages. this multilingual condition is a blessing for us. globalisation demands and speeds up the process of becoming multilingual citizens. many cities have people who can speak in more than one language. the number of bilingual and even trilingual people is rising day by day. and there is the increasing economic pressure to keep it rising on.
advancing capital goods industry
economists opine what we produce makes us who we are; i.e. a nation is known by the goods it produces. it is not merely a matter of pride but also of economics. nations that produce high value-added commodities such as capital, durable and intermediate goods requiring sophisticated human intellect have the highest national per capital income. the case of japan or germany, and more recently that of the brics countries, provides evidence to support this contention.
can we stop blaming others?
my current visit to bangladesh has been rewarding in several ways. the cultural vibrancy that seems to be running ahead of the economic regeneration is particularly stimulating. the months of february, march and april were packed with so many musical festivals and artistic events that one actually had to make considered choices about attendance! it is also encouraging to note the relentless efforts by the civil society and the ngo sector to ameliorate poverty and provide basic social services. last but not least, the professional manner in which the asia cup cricket was hosted made me feel truly proud.
