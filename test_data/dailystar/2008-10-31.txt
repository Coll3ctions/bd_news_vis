changing of the guard in male
history has clearly been made in the maldives. three decades after he rose to power in the island nation, maumoon abdul gayoom has conceded defeat to a young politician who has just beaten him at the country's first openly contested presidential election. mohammad nasheed, the 41 year-old former dissident who has just defeated gayoom, has promised that there will be no witch hunt once he forms his government in male. that is certainly most commendable. and equally commendable is the grace with which the fallen gayoom has accepted the verdict of the electorate following the second round of the voting. these are big things to note and absorb from a small country that has set an example in political and electoral probity.

us presidential election
i am writing from boston, massachusetts. there are six days left before the presidential election. all polls show senator barack obama leading against senator john mccain. mr. obama has a comfortable lead in electoral votes that determine the winner. winning 270 electoral votes is enough, as there are a total of 538 electoral votes. if senator obama and mccain win in all the states that were won by senator kerry and president bush respectively in 2004 presidential election, senator obama will win 252 electoral votes and senator mccain will win 286 electoral votes. in that scenario, senator mccain will win. but this time, senator obama is running very strong in some states that were won by president bush 4 years ago. for example, considering a very conservative estimate, senator obama is leading by a comfortable margin over senator mccain in iowa (7 electoral votes), new mexico (5 electoral votes), colorado (9 electoral votes), virginia (13 electoral votes) and if obama wins in these 4 states, he will have 286 electoral votes compared with john mccain's 252 electoral votes.
do they know?

corruption in bttb
refer to the ds editorial on institutional corruption in bttb. you have expressed surprise on the scale of corruption in public offices and cited example of using 122 labourers to fix a toilet pan and lack of accountability. this is not the only one of such amazing examples. all public utility departments like gas, water, electricity, municipality etc. are dens of open-air corruption and there is no accountability anywhere in those offices. there is a saying that the table, chairs and files of titas gas office take bribes. nothing comes out without greasing of the hands of officials of those offices.

guillain-barre syndrome
many doctors fail to detect the initial stage of gbs (guillain-barre syndrome) that effects an estimated one of 3 in every 100,000 persons annually in the usa. it can strike any race, any age, but its incidence rate increases with age. gbs may occur within days or weeks after a viral infection such as influenza (flu) diarrhoea. it may be triggered by pregnancy or a medical procedure, such as a vaccination or minor surgery. since the cause of gbs is unknown, there's no way to prevent the disease from coming in its most severe form. gbs is a medical emergency and may require hospitalisation. severe gbs may result in total paralysis - potentially dangerous fluctuation in heart rates and blood pressure and inability to breathe with respiratory assistances. view the page international
