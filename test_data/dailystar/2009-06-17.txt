netanyahu's bizarre offer to palestinians
benjamin netanyahu has just given palestinians every reason to reject the peace terms he has offered them. and with the palestinians are people around the world who have consistently believed that a two-state formula, whereby israel and a free palestine will co-exist side by side, is the only solution to what has so long been an intractable problem. what netanyahu has offered is, in effect, a rejection of everything that could have taken the middle east peace process forward. he has agreed to a two-state solution, on condition that palestine has no control over its air space and agrees to be fully demilitarized. it cannot have any defence pacts with any country and it must guarantee that israel will never be under threat from it.
politics, compromise and black money
finance minister a.m.a. muhith believes politics is the highest art of compromise. and because it is, it ought to be possible for us to understand what all this whitening of black money is all about. of course, we do realise that politics, in our post-modern world of increasingly sharpened sensibilities, is a broad matter of compromise between opposing schools of thought. it is, as we have always known, the art of the possible. to the extent that the minister speaks of the nature of politics, we agree with his perspectives on it. but we have hardly any reason to think that politics and criminality can be made to come together, to coalesce as it were, on a single platform. even ministers can be wrong about the calling of politics in life.

save our heritage
ancient monuments and buildings are the material evidence of our past. there are several heritage buildings/settlements in our country. so far a few of them have been enlisted as antiquities. but in the national antiquities act 1968, it is clearly mentioned that any ancient product of human activity, movable or immovable, illustrative of art, architecture will be treated as antiquity. so, the government should take a firm initiative to enlist heritage buildings/settlements all over our country and declare them as protected antiquities before their extinction as some are in very bad condition. in the clause 19 of national antiquities act, 1968, it is mentioned that no person shall, except for carrying out the purpose of this act, destroy, break, damage, alter, injure, deface or mutilate, or scribble, write or engrave any inscription or sign on any antiquity. but a question is raised regarding the wrong and unscientific conservation work that is destroying our history.
increased tax on cars
car prices have been increased in this budget as our finance minister had already said it in his pre-budget press conference. now my question to him is, can he show us one reason why people would not think of owning a car in dhaka city? so far, have we been able to do anything for our transport system that would prevent people from buying a car? probably not.
child labour
children aged 8 to 12 are often seen engaged in manual labour. many of them work as domestic servants and maidservants. sometimes they are engaged to work in the fields as well as in shops, hotels, restaurants, and small factories. they polish boots, sell chanachur, badam and vegetables. they also work as porters. though labour is sacred, child labour is a crime. the people who engage them take full advantage of their minor age and helplessness. the children engaged as servants or maidservants have to work from early morning to late hours at night-- fifteen to eighteen hours a day, so to say. they are not allowed any recess and recreation. moreover, they are always dealt with harshly. very often they are punished mercilessly. they are often compelled to take rotten and inferior food. in fact, they are not treated as human beings. they face similar ill treatment in the hotels, shops and factories. they work for a longer period with less wages.
disappointing cricket
the match between bangladesh and the non-test playing country ireland disappointed the whole nation.
scholarship quota

no surprise!
every year we wait for the national budget and subsequent increase of prices. this year because of our over-transparent finance ministry we did not have to wait for long. most of the figures of ups and downs of tax and other related matters were in our knowledge much before. the only thing we had to check was whether the finance minister pronounced the figures accurately. we were not disheartened. because of transparency of the ministry the car importers did bumper business assisted by transparent customs officials. they even risked their lives to climb up the car-loaded vessels in high sea, ignoring stormy weather!
it neglected
in the budget, development of technology has got little attention. the it sector has been allocated only tk. 100 crore.
mps
it appears that the government is updating the “to get” list for the mps. the list, as it stands now, has a) nam flats in dhaka, b) office with full staff in dhaka (why not in the respective localities? c) luxury pajero jeep with driver and fuel etcetera, d) administrative and financial authority in upazila parishads, e) chairmanship of governing bodies of all educational institutions of respective localities, f) authority to beat anybody (as seen in cox's bazar ), g) authority to extort (as seen in chittagong ). the list is getting bigger and bigger every day.
daylight saving
among other considerations, one of the reasons for the birth and launching of rural electrification programme was that the rural people go to bed too early thus wasting a lot of man-hours. it is an irony that now we can't provide them enough electricity in the evening hours to be more productive.
tipaimukh and saarc
we are watching many movements, discussions and campaigns to protest the tipaimukh dam. tipaimukh dam is threatening our country but our govt. is not working on it at all. we are a member of saarc and saarc began its journey from bangladesh. so, the responsibility to make saarc effective comes to us first. why did we build saarc? was it built for entertaining the ministers, prime ministers or presidents of these eight member countries? every year we see there is a summit, and all the guardians from the member countries meet at a place, discuss some issues, give superb speeches and finally enjoy some cultural and entertainment programmes arranged by the host country. is that all for which it was built, entertaining our state representatives? if problems like tipaimukh cannot be solved through saarc, then it is useless. so my request to the authorities, please do something now.
weapon of logic
after successful completion of audc (asian universities debating championship), i would like to thank ewu for arranging such a prestigious debating event. debate is not only a strong intellectual weapon of logic and argument, it is more than that. it encourages students to be knowledgeable, increases leadership quality and analytical power. but in case of english debate we need to realize the necessity of learning english well. we fail to achieve the best in this tournament, though others asian countries like the philippines, malaysia and singapore are doing well. i urge the government to take some steps for our educational system. english has to be given priority from the primary level.
obama's stand
it is really a great call by president barack obama for a new beginning between the us and muslims around the world. i guess from now on people around the world would be able to relax and see a big change. the american effort to ease tension is really appreciable. but it should not be just a call. i think for a positive change it would be wise to ensure more interaction among the nations.
boycott culture continues
boycott has become an important part of our parliamentary democracy.
unfair bus fares
it is quite difficult for the departments of the government to regularly monitor all the problems & sufferings of the people and address them properly. but there are some men-made problems which can be solved easily if the authorities look into them.

over the last two weeks or so, images of rivers in the throes of death have appeared on the front page of the daily star. we the readers have watched, to our horror, the ugly face of encroachment. the concrete structures built by these grabbers on the lifeline of the capital city are reminiscent of the prehistoric reptiles or some other slimy creatures.
leaders challenged
sometimes it seems to me that we are living in a country run by the likes of hubuchandro and gobuchandro or the characters in satyajit ray's 'hirok rajar deshe', where the king brainwashes the citizens into his eccentric idea that there is no need for education and illumination. people and the press have been so long complaining about the inconsistencies, ineptitude and thoughtlessness of the ministers. however, now it brings some comfort to people to see that politicians do not go unchallenged as it was seen in the central working council meeting of the ruling party where members pointed accusing fingers at ministers.
eis programme
from our history we come to know that the muslims of this subcontinent lagged behind, compared to their hindu compatriots, because of their apathy towards learning english language. from then on, our experts are putting emphasis on learning english as a second language. even then, we haven't fully realized the importance of learning english yet. that is why the english in schools (eis) programme, an initiative to promote english among the school going students, is a timely one. it will make our students familiar with global needs. on the other hand, it will greatly facilitate the students to pursue higher studies at home and abroad, since most of our national universities follow english curriculum and texts.
a tall order…
the statement of state minister for science & technology that the rooppur nuclear power plant would hopefully start generating power in five years adding 1000mw of electricity to the national grid is big news for the nation that is suffering from crippling power crisis. this would-be nuclear power plant was established about half a century ago on 260 acres of land at rooppur in pabna. even today i cherish the fond memory of participating in the procession demanding the construction of this nuclear power plant during my student life at buet in the late sixties. responsible ministers of this government are also telling that the first padma bridge at mawa and the second one at paturia will be completed within the next 3-5 years. the prime minister herself told that whatever it costs, the government would retrieve the country's complete river system.
technology issue
foreign technology dependent advancement: do you think it is the right solution? i think it's a catch 22 situation. you modernise this day and the day after you find you're nowhere again!
