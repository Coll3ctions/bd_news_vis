31 bangladeshis in distress
the woes of 31 bangladeshi crew on eight foreign ships on the benin coast go on. one would have thought that by this time meaningful action would have been taken to save them from the dire circumstances in which they have found themselves. that they continue to be caught in a state of misery is not only a matter of sadness but one of sheer outrage as well. of course their employers are responsible for the state they are in. and of course every effort should be expended to apprehend the unscrupulous men, both in bangladesh and in the countries of origin of the ships in question, and penalize them for their criminality. it is simply unacceptable that people can do wrong, in this case place other people's lives in jeopardy, and can get away with the act.

weekly currency roundup
april 18- 22, 2010
international markets
the international markets remained highly volatile this week. on thursday after data showing greece's budget deficit was worse than previously thought highlighted the market's hunger for a speedy resolution to its debt crisis. eurostat revised greece's 2009 budget deficit to 13.6 percent of gross domestic product from 12.7 percent. the greek/german 10-year government bond yield spread expanded to 562 basis points after the figures to its widest in 12 years as the cost of insuring greek debt from default surged to record highs. the eurostat figures show that the starting point for greece's debt consolidation is further away than initially thought," said chris turner, head of currency strategy at ing in london. the market is getting close to pricing in an end game for the greece story, which is the acquisition of an aid package. greece started talks with european and imf officials on wednesday on a potential aid deal and a three-year economic policy plan but it could take several weeks before athens can tap the funds if needed. greece needs to raise about 10 billion euros by end-may to refinance debt, make interest payments and fund the deficit. against the pound, the euro fell to its weakest since late january. sterling was supported by recent uk data suggesting britain's economic outlook has brightened. first-quarter gdp numbers are due on friday. data on thursday showed uk retail sales came in at a lower-than-expected 0.4 percent on month in march, but february's figures were revised higher. analysts said the euro may take another thumping when greece activates the aid package and formally asks for help. overall, they said debt worries involving euro zone countries would continue to haunt the euro. view the page metropolitan

your worst nightmare
enough has appeared in the newspapers about motorized vehicles i.e. cars to make us aware of their “benefits” they crowd the roads with 7 times their capacity, they occupy 50-60% of road space, they carry only 2-5% of passengers, they park here, there and everywhere with impunity, they are mollycoddled with hundreds of crores of expensive electronic toys just to ease the passage of empty/half-empty cars, they pollute the air and deafen the people, they kill or maim hundreds of pedestrians, they drain out foreign exchange and inflate the egos of the nouveau riche.
child abuse
the term “child abuse” refers to the violence, mistreatment or neglect that a child or adolescent may experience while in the care of someone they either trust or depend on, such as a parent, sibling, other relative, caregiver or guardian. abuse may take place anywhere and may occur, for example, within the child's home or that of someone known to the child. there are many different forms of abuse and a child may be subjected to more than one form: physical abuse may consist of just one incident or it may happen repeatedly. it involves deliberately using force against a child in such a way that the child is either injured or is at risk of being injured. physical abuse includes beating, hitting, shaking, pushing, choking, biting, burning, kicking or assaulting a child with a weapon. it also includes holding a child under water, or any other dangerous or harmful use of force or restraint. sexual abuse and exploitation involves using a child for sexual purposes. neglect is often chronic, and it usually involves repeated incidents. it involves failing to provide what a child needs for his or her physical, psychological or emotional development and well-being. for example, neglect includes failing to provide a child with food, clothing, shelter, cleanliness, medical care or protection from harm. emotional neglect includes failing to provide a child with love, safety, and a sense of worth. emotional abuse involves harming a child's sense of self. it includes acts (or omissions) that result in, or place a child at risk of, serious behavioural, cognitive, emotional or mental health problems. for example, emotional abuse may include verbal threats, social isolation, intimidation, exploitation, or routinely making unreasonable demands. it also includes terrorizing a child, or exposing them to family violence. an abuser may use a number of different tactics to gain access to a child, exert power and control over them, and prevent them from telling anyone about the abuse or seeking support. a child who is being abused is usually in a position of dependence on the person who is abusing them. abuse is a misuse of power and a violation of trust.
sad truth
bangladesh is one of the poorest and most densely populated countries with a large population suffering from innumerable problems.
ngo sector
the present government has much success and has taken many initiatives in different areas but the ngo sector remains unchanged. the government should take some pragmatic steps to reorganise the sector as it has a huge contribution to the development of the country.
why suicide?
committing suicide is a malady which has suddenly started to grip the young generation of our country. every day, unfolding the morning newspaper, i am greatly dismayed and astonished to find reports on youths who have chosen the route to death by themselves.
cheerleaders
we are having some wonderful t20 cricket named ncl for the first time. but something caught my eyes two days ago, when i saw a picture in the sports page of the daily star. it was a snapshot of cheerleaders dancing outside the boundary rope. i don't understand why this is necessary. already, we are facing lots of problems in the form of teasing and violence on women. then why should we imitate someone else's practice which only degrades womenfolk? can't we all stand against these and think something positive?
holy message
it is very distressing to hear that the politicians are frequently using indecent words, even also in parliament, towards their rivals. they should always keep in mind the holy messages of our dearest nabi and rasul hazrat muhammad (pbuh).
upazila issue
the new move by the government has opened up new avenues for controversy in the management of the upazila parishad. the chairman remains as chief executive whereas the uno becomes principal executive-- what is the difference ? this amendment will come as a bill in the next session or promulgated by ordinance not clear yet. there is no reason to believe that the government has come out of their hidden position to maintain the political string in the upazia parisad.

physical presence
a few days back, i took my wife to a hospital in gulshan for medical treatment. while entering the main entrance i saw lots of marks on the doors from the dirty, greasy & sweating hands. inside i observed the furniture, partitions & floors all neat, tidy & clean. next i asked the passing-by cleaner in uniform whether they had glass cleaning liquid & a piece of cloth so that the entrance doors could be cleaned.
controversial judges
with all due respect to the policies adopted by the government and their success and failure i would like to draw your kind attention to the recent controversy with regard to the two controversial judges' appointment. seventeen judges, including those two judges, were appointed by the president of bangladesh. out of them 15 were sworn in by the honourable chief justice of bangladesh. due to the constant and persistent pressure from the pro bnp lawyers the chief justice refrained from administering the oaths of those two controversial judges. though it was initiated by those lawyers but it was the demand of the most of the general people of bangladesh who have facilitated the bangladesh awami league to achieve absolute majority in the last general election. at least, the people of bangladesh, especially those who are related to the law profession, heaved a sigh of relief that the government was relieved by the chief justice of bangladesh of the stigma of the worst form of nepotism and favouritism.
politics of litigation
the 20 april ds editorial 'politics of litigation" is a message for both the ruling and opposition leaders. begum khaleda's threat to put the present ruling party men into a volley of litigations after her return to power again is the outburst of her "scare" of trial of cantonment house notice case, money laundering cases against her two sons and also the parliament office misappropriation cases against some senior leaders. there are many cases of corruption against bnp leaders. all these cases, in fact, were filed during the caretaker administration and not by the present ruling party after its return to power.
