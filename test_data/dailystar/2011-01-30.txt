the people rise in egypt
as we reflect on the state of things in egypt today, the situation takes increasingly newer dimensions with every moment that goes by. tens of thousands of egyptians keep pouring on to the streets, demanding that president hosni mubarak quit power. for his part, the long-time egyptian leader has tried to pacify the country by sacking his ministers, which of course is not enough. he has promised to carry on with what he calls reforms, a promise he has made over the years without meaning to carry it through. in these past thirty years, politics in the country, never very enlightening, has stagnated. mubarak has not only ensured that he wins elections with no less than 98 per cent of the vote every time, but has seen to it that his opponents cannot raise any protest on pain of being locked away. meanwhile, in the manner of so many other rulers in the region and elsewhere, he has carefully been grooming his son gamal to take over from him. view the page sports

enhance mustard oil production
in a talk show on a tv channel last sunday the commerce minister mentioned that only 5% of our total consumption of edible oil is met from the local produce like mustard oil. this pushed me to remember my boyhood days in mid fifties, when living in a sub-divisional town, i saw all people in that town used only mustard oil for cooking. if we consider the population of that time at about 40 million ( us census record) which is about 25% of the present population of bangladesh at 160 million, then what happened today that we import 95% of our edible oil consumption as the minister mentioned. to my calculation it should be 75% only of total consumption today. present higher consumption figures may be for two reasons, one for increased cooking oil consumption due to improvement in our life style or due to some wrong information.

act now!
in a letter to the editor on january 17, muhammed jamil ather writes from karachi that we need to act now to reverse the causes of global warming and strike the right balance between development and conservation. i agree. instead of whining about what the "developed" world has already caused (and as an american, i confess we've done a lot wrong) let's get on with correcting what we can where we are. here in dhaka, the asthma caused by "dust" (air pollution) is killing babies and shortening the lives of all residents. let's enforce the laws already on the books to get brick factories to install scrubbers in their smoke stacks. you can see which ones are complying by seeing the white smoke pouring out, and which ones are polluting our lungs with coal-black smoke. are bribes involved with this? and the buses and trucks with black exhaust--why are they allowed to operate? construction sites? they should have "curtains" to contain the dust of concrete, sand, and sawdust and not be allowed to spew it into the atmosphere. we have the means to greatly improve our environment just by enforcing the laws we already have. please, let's get started. it's a matter of life and death, and it's do-able!
