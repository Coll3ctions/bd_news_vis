mujibnagar . . . lighting a candle in the dark
the formation of the provisional bangladesh government in mujibnagar remains, and will remain, a defining moment in our lives. it came into shape in the grey region that served as the frontier between the sinister and the illuminating. the sinister was the programmed genocide launched with unprecedented viciousness by the pakistan occupation army; and the illuminating was the truth that such a brutal assault on human dignity, indeed on the traditions of a people, could not go unchallenged and unbeaten. and so it was on 17 april 1971 that in meherpur of chuadanga, the senior leaders of the awami league, close associates of bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman, came together to proclaim before the world that out of the debris of a fast enveloping war had emerged a government, the overriding purpose behind the deed being the liberation of the land.

a beginning... a discrete journey
in bangladesh we get to welcome in a new year twice. once on 31st december. and a second time on 14th april. how blessed we feel to start afresh at the stroke of midnight; or to break open the bind of a new hal-khata and poise our pens atop a blank page. there is something wonderfully life-affirming about the beginning of something new. a beginning is a discrete journey of sorts, ours to interpret as we wish. an ending denotes a reactive beginning thereafter. stuck at crossroads denotes the proactive beginning. whatever the particular interpretation, the concept remains the same. hope. faith. resolution.
invasion
the hordes approached, filling up the vast expanse with their steely grey formations, a formidable gathering. a hush descended, and the air had an expectant, almost electric taste to it. the lone crow spread its sooty wings in a lazy glide that belied its nervousness at the sudden calm and the dimming light.
end of grey
i popped open the tab on my noodle soup. it fizzed as the sachet released its score of vitamins. taste calibration molecules began to color the clear white algae. there was a beauty to this, jellyfish changing color at dawn. my room was cardboard cutout, same as hundreds i had slept in. a pallet, a tray, a box for personal toiletries and extra clothes, of which i had none. i had rented the room for a week, rare, because i moved around a lot. i needed a fixed address this time, however, damn the expense. a knock. i put down my bowl, unfinished. my last friend this side of the world crawled in, wearing his physician's smock. he had his briefcase, full of the drugs i had paid for.
the little bird
there's a jackfruit tree growing in front of my window. i am lying in bed, looking at it. it's been trimmed recently, i note with some sadness. it's not my jackfruit tree so i have no control over it. its roots are in the neighbouring garden but, i assume, over the years it has leaned onto this side of the wall. the body of the tree is thus floating above what is technically our air space. i haven't known this tree long but i feel a kinship with it. for, my roots were planted somewhere else but my body is floating over someone else's air space.
my american dream
i believe in second chances. i believe in this absolutely, for my life is a testament to the universe's ability to press the refresh button, to at least give back some of the things that are taken in its purging tsunamis, where the storm washes away the clutter and sometimes leaves clarity in its wake.
places
the thing about places is that they make you believe in lies. out of context truths can be lies. that's why i never trusted how a place made me feel. that might work to my disadvantage you might say. and to clear that up i should say i am not talking about planned vacations or weekend trips to parents, i am talking about those planned non-vacations, the migrations and di-migrations, the ones you impose on yourself to encourage progression of some kind, wealth, health, spirituality…all bull.
in between
the first thing i remember is the taste of leather and dirt. something kept banging against my chin. when i opened my eyes i saw a big-ass army issue leather boot swinging in. thwack! i winced more out of habit because i felt no pain.

nuclear summit endorses us' nuclear objectives
one of president obama's election pledges was to secure “loose nukes” in his first term in office. towards achieving that pledge, he invited to washington 47 nuclear states to get a plan of action to deal with nuclear threat from non-state actors and terrorist groups in place of “some vague gauzy statements.” in the built up to this summit, secretary of state hillary clinton said that us intelligence sources have information that al qaeda terrorists are seeking to get hold of nuclear weapons while at the same time planning to target nuclear installations for terrorist attacks. her statement put the summit in context.

will the united states and pakistan ever trust each other enough to cooperate fully in fighting the taliban and al qaeda? this was the question haunting the recent strategic dialogue between the top brass of the two countries, which aimed to put their prickly relationship on a new footing. although pakistan's delegation was headed by its foreign minister, the suave shah mahmood qureshi, it also included its wily military commander, general ashfaq kayani. washington promised to speed up delivery of economic aid and military equipment for pakistan's increased efforts at battling militants on the afghan border. “this is a new day,” declared secretary of state hillary clinton, who hopes to shrink the yawning trust deficit between the two countries. but are there grounds to believe that when it comes to fighting militants, islamabad and the white house' interests can converge? view the page star books review
