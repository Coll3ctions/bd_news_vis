a christmas tree
view the page editorial
merry christmas!
the birth of jesus christ in bethlehem, like the coming of any prophet into the realm of common men and women, remains a seminal event in history. for jesus symbolised the principles of humanity and love we today associate with the values which underpin the christian outlook on life. and coming within the ambit of this feeling of christianity is the thought that jesus spoke for all men and women and for all time. those are the foundations on which religions establish themselves, the roots to which all are bound in terms of religious belief. the sense of piety we associate with faith, any faith, was precisely the message which came from jesus, whose comprehension of sin, of cruelty as practised by those unaware of or indifferent to the ways of god, was acute enough to have him go through pain in an intensely personal way. and yet he did not complain, for greater than the pain was the agony humanity went through at the hands of the insensitive and the uncaring.
