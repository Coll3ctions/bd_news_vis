diplomat on border killings
indian foreign secretary nirupama rao's call for joint efforts towards putting an end to killings of people on the indo-bangladesh border draws attention once more to an old, known problem. to be sure, ms. rao's remarks, made to a group of bangladeshi journalists in delhi, are welcome and reflect india's concern over an issue that has exercised bangladesh's mind over the years. that both dhaka and delhi need to sort out the problem through making sure that civilians, both indian and bangladeshi, are not pushed to unexpected death on the border, has never been in doubt. but the realities, particularly for bangladesh, have been rather painful. with reports almost always coming in of some bangladeshi national or other being shot by india's border security force, it makes sense to ask if better measures cannot be taken to deal with the issue. view the page sports

will osama's death bring peace ?
on 2nd may, all western news channels, bbc,cnn and sky news that i watch regularly; highlighted the killing of osama bin laden at his stronghold in abbotabad in pakistan; hardly 50 miles from islamabad! imagine bin laden living there with his family; and the isi knowing nothing about it! seems very surprising! there seems to be "many a slip, between the cup and the lip", as the popular saying goes! pakistan's isi is today at the bottom of the 'rubbish bin', worldwide!
save our tigers
the players of bangladesh cricket team have become known as tigers all over the world. we become highly delighted whenever our team wins a match, especially against a powerful team. but what about our real tigers? do we care for them? the lives of the tigers in the sundarbans are in jeopardy. various factors are responsible for this. for example, the illegal intruders in the sundarbans are cutting trees indiscriminately and hunting the wild animals. moreover, climate change and other manmade problems are making the sundarbans ecologically imbalanced. as a result, availability of food and hunting ground of tigers are decreasing day by day. so, the govt. has to take immediate initiatives to protect the tigers, otherwise tigers will be extinct very soon in the sundarbans.
low quality of oms rice
with the honest intention of saving the poor people from the onslaught of ever-increasing price of rice, the govt. has been selling rice at a reduced rate through open market sales (oms) throughout the country. but very often the rice sold at oms centres is of such a low quality that it is only usable as poultry feed. it is actually a mixture of particles (khud) of different varieties of rice full of husks and grits. the rice seems to have lost its original colour and emits a bad odour. perhaps it had remained heaped up in godowns for years. it will be nice if the authorities do not consider oms as govt. charity and the people who queue up to buy oms rice as beggars!
heredity and stupidity?
apparently, the whole world was taken aback by the pomp and grandeur of the british fairytale royal nuptial on 29 april 2011. to the awe of the spectators, this couple was much brighter than the movie stars. and indeed they have to be, as they are the real prince and the real princess.
name changing game
the ruling government is changing names of the old famous structures and also naming every newly built structure after the name of bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman. every famous place, whether it's a hospital or bridge or conference center, is getting the same name. on the other hand, same name for different things is creating huge confusion. and some changes are really difficult to remember. i sincerely request the govt. to stop this useless name changing game. because, we all know that your work will make you memorable, not your name.
geiger-muller counter

over the last one year we have written several times to our ministry of communications, ministry of science information and communication technology, ministry of lgrd, ministry of planning, and department of roads and highways to kindly let us know the road distance from our capital city dhaka to our upazila headquarters, and also the distance from district headquarters to upazila headquarters, but all in vain.
no more private universities
in recent times setting up of private universities has become a fashion. this is a profitable business in the name of providing education. the recent annual reports published by the ugc indicate that private universities are widely offering business oriented courses to produce graduates and post graduates. there are many universities which are running without having the ugc's approval. thus, the quality of education has deteriorated alarmingly. also, foreign culture is being widely exercised in those universities, which has a long term detrimental effects on our moral values. it is high time the govt. stopped giving permission to set up any more private university.
contrasting leaders
if one takes a closer look at the american presidents, one shall see that soon after assumption of the office, they begin to grow grey hairs and appear to be older than usual, which presumably results from thoughts and worries.
disgusting act!
on 26th april 2011, a news was published in the daily star that a student of an english medium school in dhaka stopped attending school because an administrator hit her and six others with a wooden ruler for protesting the expulsion of two classmates. this is unacceptable.
ban student politics
clashes among student groups are becoming front page news in the national dailies. we observe that clash between activists of two political parties are more ferocious than that of two factions of a same party. some days ago such a clash between two factions of bangladesh chhatra league (bcl) took place at dhaka university over establishing supremacy at the dormitory that left 50 hurt. in the past, many promising students were killed and injured in these types of clashes. these sorts of incidents mostly occurred between pro-bnp and pro-al activists. even over a trivial matter, the activists used to entangle themselves in the fierce clash using illegal arms.
poverty is curse
our dearest rasul (pbuh) often prayed to allah to protect him from poverty. he says, ''the utter state of poverty leads a person to become even a 'kafir' (atheist)." poverty is obviously a big hindrance to any type of development of the country. so, the authorities concerned should soon take some urgent initiatives to alleviate poverty from our society.
