chief lesson from cyclone aila
the most important lesson which can be drawn from cyclone aila, which last week hit south-western bangladesh, is that a comprehensive programme regarding the construction and maintenance of embankments needs to be put in place. it is an issue about which the inhabitants of cyclone-prone areas are acutely aware, for they themselves have been demanding that more than anything else it is strong embankments they need. in effect, what they have been saying is that if they have embankments to protect themselves, they can take care of everything else.
extortionists having a field day
the congenial environment for the growth of trade and commerce is being denied by armed gangs of extortionists, who have seemingly become hyperactive. a good number of the victims were fatally shot in recent months when they failed or refused to come up with the money demanded. we are troubled by the reported revelation that around 1200 extortionists clustered into 300 gangs might be operating in the metropolis, thereby contributing to the spiralling of crime in the city. reports of industrialists and business personalities receiving phone calls from these criminals with demands for huge sums of money are pouring in to the print and electronic media. according to dhaka metropolitan police (dmp) cell as many as 250 extortion related complaints were lodged since its formation on april 28. and needless to mention that many incidents go unreported as victims opt to remain unidentified for fear of reprisals.
in quest of a credible political leadership
the emergence of bangladesh was both preceded and followed by a series of extraordinary circumstances -- protracted civil unrest, the worst cyclone in history, the first-ever general elections, non-cooperation, a genocide, war, victory, famine and finally the violent overthrow of the first elected government culminating in the assassination of the nation's founding father -- all of which dearly cost this already impoverished country in more than one way, perhaps, one of the most serious casualties of some of these traumatic events had been the near-total decimation of the country's credible political leadership.

cyclone aila
cyclone aila has proved yet again how ill-prepared we are. it's either that, or we really need to wake up as should those who call the shots. "being aware" and "being prepared" is one thing both of which we grossly lack, obviously. add to that “down-playing” the situation - as did the minister of food and disaster management when (according to a report in the daily star of 28 may 2009 under the caption “over 1,100 missing in bagerhat, bhola”) the day after the cyclone he declared that the death toll would not cross 100 confidently adding that there might be only 10 or 12 people missing!

budget and the disabled
according to world health organisation, about 1.5 crore or 10 percent of the total population is disabled in bangladesh. of them, more than seven percent are physically disabled and the remaining intellectually challenged.
our waterways
the ds has over the years carried out many investigative reports, but none as vital or as noble as the current campaign to save our waterways. our lives depend on fresh water but it seems our 'leaders' are powerless to stop the onslaught or maybe they themselves are part of it.
digital or educated bangladesh?
our government wants to build a digital bangladesh within 2021. is this whole concept of digital bangladesh only about getting fastest internet on our cell phones and computer? who are these people that are going to be part of this digital bangladesh? is this only a segmented group of people who know the meaning and the use of it or should it be for everyone starting from the micro level? what is the meaning of this high promotion if everyone in our county is not part of it?
sad truth
article 39 of the constitution of bangladesh guarantees the freedom of thought and action. but in the last two years, the general people could not enjoy their fundamental rights, because democracy was not active. people say it was an army-backed government. though mr. iajuddin was the elected president of a democratic country, he declared the emergency in an improper way. after a long time, mr. iajuddin has come back and raised a lot of questions through his recent comments. last sunday, he was interviewed by a private channel. but he could not say anything convincing!
chittagong arms haul
the whole nation must have been stunned at the news of the big arms haul in chittagong during the bnp-jamaat rule. they miserably failed to probe the incident and bring the ring leader behind the biggest ever arms smuggling case to book. rather, they tried to burry it. now with the coming of the al led grand alliance to power, they started anew to reinvestigate the case and every day new things are coming to public view.
greenhouse effect
greenhouse gases are the components of the atmosphere that contribute to the greenhouse effect. the greenhouse gases are naturally occurring and include carbon dioxide, methane, water vapour, chlorofluorocarbons and other trace chemicals. but it is now known that man-made chemicals have caused a massive build-up of greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere.
in the name of democracy…
time and time again, we, the general citizens are being reminded by the politicians and their leaders/activists, that democracy means we should get prepared to witness street agitation, rampant damage to public and private properties, party meetings blocking the busiest thoroughfares if necessary, etc. etc. the list is endless. these fine acts of politics were carried out again and again by whoever belonged to the opposition party. and we, the taxpayers, were compelled to watch helplessly how the drama unfolded in the name of democracy. we should remember that they hold the supreme power to close down the roads, while we pay the taxes, they have the right to vandalise anything anywhere, while we toil hard to earn those. so, what is our standing today? i guess, back to the time where democracy is being interpreted in these politicians' own terms, not by what we learn from the constitution. nothing has changed, the thinking patterns of the politicians, their behaviour, their outrageous actions! on sunday, there was a scuffle between police and the leaders of bnp, over the issue of submitting a memorandum to the dc. but to protest the police actions, what mr. amanullah aman said to the rally, right in the presence of district bnp president, barrister nazmul huda, was indeed mind-blowing. he literally declared that if necessary, they would lay a total siege to the whole nation!
land grabbing
i have been following the reports in the daily star on land grabbing from the rivers and water bodies in and around the city. i really appreciate this campaign and want to contribute as a citizen of this country.
encroachers
the ds has printed many photos (it did earlier also) along with detailed news on land encroachment by some unscrupulous developers or plot sellers. those encroachers are filling up canals, rivers in and around the capital city under the very nose of the law enforcers. in most of the cases, the govt high ups are behind these plots. though the illegal act has been continuing for a long time, the authorities concerned have not taken any punitive action against land grabbers. already, dhaka city is facing the threat of an environmental disaster.
politicians and people
yes, 1/11 has taught us that the ultimate power is the people and the politicians are the ultimate instrument to run the country. this is a fact and everyone knows that politicians will have to go to the people to get the mandate for a specific time to sit at the helm and serve the people. it is a cycle of change in the democratic norms and all politicians should not only believe it, but they should also mentally accept this fact. this system is followed in all the democratic countries in the world.
finance minister's comment
most of the finance minister's comments are innocent and repetitive. but his recent comment on imposition of high taxes on reconditioned cars has created a havoc in the market. prices jumped up creating a bonanza for importers and dealers. as i visited the market to purchase a car for my son, i found the prices up by 2 to 5 lakh.
good news
it is great news that i read in the prothom alo regarding public- private participation in the upcoming budget. as a student of economics, i think that it is a dire need, as bangladesh is a developing country and here a lot of investment is needed for further development, especially in the field of infrastructure development such as roads, seaports, land ports, airports, railways, power generation etc. as bangladesh is one of the poorest countries in the world and every budget has to be shown as deficit budget, which is one kind of social burden, for meeting up these the government has to take loans from internal and external agencies with high interest rates. so, the role of the private entrepreneurs could come in handy as far as our development programmes are concerned.
two major issues
i congratulate this awami league government for initiating the process of trial of 1971 war criminals and their local collaborators. no government had in the last 38 years even mentioned it ever.
