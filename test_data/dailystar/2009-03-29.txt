murder in the mosque
the bombing of a mosque in pakistan's frontier town of jamrud on friday is a reminder once again of the increasing fragility of society and the state authority in that unfortunate country. the suicide killing left at least fifty people dead, with scores injured. there is every likelihood that the casualty figures will rise, adding to the grim nature of the tragedy. it is certainly not the first time that a mosque has been made the target of a violent attack in pakistan. it is an ominous sign of how much radicalised religious fanatics have become in pakistan of late. they are now ready and willing to transfer the ferocity of their internecine sectarian conflict to the interior of places of worship.

giving credit where it's due
we are all too quick to cut someone to size. we never miss to seize the opportunity to point out the faults in others no matter how inane those imperfections are. we surely take delight in others' follies even if those are the result of honest efforts at doing something meaningful that somehow had gone astray. at the same time we are probably the stingiest, most tight-fisted and the most miserly people when it comes to praising the good deeds of others. what we have in its place are unabashed flattery and undeserved credits showered by self-seeking sycophants on the situational masters of the day.

independence day thoughts
the cold breeze swept through the pale, fragile body of the child standing immobile in the heavy downpour. raindrops were falling on his porcelain smooth skin--mingling with the stream of moisture that was overflowing from his coal black eyes. he heaved a deep sigh as he tried to recall the events that led him here although his mind rebelled, frightened to bring back those painful incidents where he saw his own father being piled up in a heap of dead bodies, a nasty stench coming from the mutilated corpse-who was a vibrant man cradling him in his big, wide arms a day or two ago before that -------- bdr carnage.
politicised students
in my childhood i used to hear a sentence from my teachers -- education is the backbone of a nation. but at that time i could not realize the deeper meaning of the sentence. now, this statement should more appropriately be "quality education is the backbone of a nation." unfortunately, the quality of our country's education seems to be declining gradually, and this is largely the fault of our policy makers and the overall educational system. moreover, the state of our student politics is at such a level that the prospect of quality education is unthinkable. i am really shocked with the news of recent political violence in different educational institutions. i think no civilized society would tolerate such violence in educational institutions. when the whole world is now in great fear of the economic recession and thinking about the possible ways to get rid of this situation, we are fighting with each other and killing one another. but what should be the duty of our students?
power generation
as we all know we are having an electricity shortfall of about 2000mw per day. the situation is becoming worse as most of the age old power stations across the country can't run to their full capacity. on the other hand, due to fast urban development the country needs more & more electricity. since the last 4 party alliance government did not do anything to generate power according to the demand of the country the hunger for power is increasing day by day. though this new government is trying to address this issue on an emergency basis but it is very difficult to sort out this chronic problem in a year or so. on the one hand, the government should review what would be their source of energy i.e. gas, coal or fuel. fuel is the most expensive source of energy nowadays to run any power station, so we have to look for alternate source of energy. since we have sufficient coal we should prepare a coal policy at the earliest to utilise our own resources. since we are having a shortfall of about 2000mw per day we should also look for nuclear power plants, as nowadays there are several countries which are using nuclear power plants to mitigate the demand for energy. understandably, the government has started dialogues with russia to negotiate commissioning of rooppur power plant with a capacity of 1000mw. besides china & india have also shown interest to help build such nuclear power plants.

doctors' strike
we, the common people of the country, take exception to the latest incident that took place at dmch. there was allegation that the patient died due to negligence of doctors. as the deceased's relatives were under such an impression, they might have failed to control their emotions.
bleak future
i'm writing to you because i think i'm a responsible citizen of this country who had the great good fortune to witness the great liberation war as a petty officer in then exiled govt of bangladesh. to speak the truth, the whole spirit of lw was lost immediately after the new govt took power. just as our political leaders in the partition era (1947) did not care to get the ist radcliff award exacted, rather set to fighting for 'gadi' and thereafter put all blame on wp leaders; the power-hungry, money-starved political leaders of bangladesh got down to plundering the assets, immediately after liberation. nobody bothered to restore the morale and morality of a traumatized nation; rehabilitate the people mentally after the great shock and set the judiciary and the education sector, first on the right track. instead, party goons and thugs have since been nurtured in both the camps, thereby entirely degrading the standard of education.
university and environment
with due respect i would like to refer your 18th, 20th and 22nd mar'09 editions' feature news, where in it has been observed that our sense of environmental cautiousness is increasing, which is obviously a good sign . a good environment is of course an important ingredient of a healthy life. in this regard , i would like to share the following with you. there is a university at dhanmondi. on its left side, stands a school. hundreds of small children are coming every morning and breathing the black smoke of the university power generator, besides the tremendous sound pollution during their classes. also in the apartment houses there are many small children, aged and sick persons living among others, who can not intake fresh southern air for the same problem.
post-riquelme argentina
the mercurial playmaker, juan roman riquelme of boca juniors, has announced his retirement from argentina national football team. he cited differences of football tactics and philosophies with coach diego maradona, a former boca junior player as well. the inclusion of riquelme in the national team has pros and cons. the team has to be built around him and whenever he is in top form, the whole team plays well, but whenever he does not click, it seems to affect the performance of the whole team. that is why, he was hardly called up by former coach marcelo bielsa. since coach bielsa stepped down from his coaching role in late 2004, then coach jose pekerman built the team around him. this trend continued under coach alfio basile. in the meantime, a new superstar, lionel messi has become the most important player for the argentina national team. the new coach, maradona, repeatedly said the he would include riquelme in his team and want him to be a part and parcel of it. but he said he wanted a slightly different role for riquelme. apparently, it was not acceptable for riquelme.
