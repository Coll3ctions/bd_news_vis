move to clip acc wings
any move to dilute the authority of the anti-corruption commission can only send out very bad signals to the country. there is a clear reason why. in these past two years and more, the degree to which the acc was empowered to handle acts of corruption (and that was per courtesy of the caretaker government) was without question something that rekindled hope among people about the future of democratic governance. to be sure, the acc has not been above criticism and has indeed been condemned for some of its more controversial acts. but what surely cannot be denied is the principle upon which it has been working since early 2007. whether the body will continue to wield that kind of authority in the future now depends on what the present political dispensation means to do about it. if reports of a possible clipping of the acc's wings turn out to be true, all one can say is that it will be a regressive move that can only impede the nation's journey to a full and meaningful democratic order.
tense bangladesh myanmar border
we cannot but be concerned by the reported buildup of large number of myanmar military force in very close proximity of our border. this is in addition to the nasaka or the myanmar border force whose strength has also been increased manifold.
the pariah's nuclear blackmail
none would dispute the generally held belief that north korea and burma have the two most oppressive regimes in asia. they rule over two of the continent's backwater, and that's no coincidence whatever. notwithstanding the many common features they, however, have stark differences between them. no foreign leader of distinction cares to pay court to the ruling generals of burma in their weirdly grandiose new capital of naypidaw. in sharp contrast, even bill clinton, one of the world's most recognisable celebrity statesmen, makes pilgrimage to pyonyang.
the son also rises
this is what we saw in a photograph. the mother was addressing the us investors in new york last month, and the son was sitting next to her. she was the prime minister of bangladesh, but who was he other than being her own son? we have reports he went there as an advisor to the prime minister. this newspaper published a report on september 26, which described him as "prime minister's son living in america." if dr. pangloss in voltaire's candide were amongst us, he would have reiterated that we are living in the best of all possible worlds.
taking rickshaws off increased traffic jam
many eyebrows will surely be raised on reading the title. let's try to work out the sums. it's reported that in 1995, there were about 35,000 private cars and jeeps. by 2009, that number exploded to a massive 200,000, and still more are being added every month. why? most people, riding the additional 165,000 cars and jeeps, were riding rickshaws earlier. when the roads they had to pass through became off-limits to rickshaws, these people had no other option than to buy cars, even if that needed selling property or taking loans. policymakers thought that taking rickshaws off the road would give the limited number of people riding cars the freedom to roam about unobstructed. they could not realise that so many had the capacity to buy cars. view the page sports

somerset win thriller
"i can't believe i have done that," said an ecstatic alfonso thomas, who hit two boundaries in the last three deliveries of a thriller to steal and seal victory for somerset in the champions league encounter at the rajiv gandhi international stadium in hyderabad on saturday. in a rollercoaster of a match, somerset just about managed to hold their nerves courtesy a 50-run partnership for the eighth wicket between thomas and james hildreth to get past the line off the last ball of the match. the equation came down to five runs from three balls with one wicket left when thomas sliced a full toss from scott styris -- who had taken two wickets in the final over -- to the deep point boundary before bringing up the win with another carve over point.

population boom
mr. mamoon's letter (5 oct) deals with the most important problem facing the country in the foreseeable future. the government and donor agencies must rectify the shortfall of birth control pills and artefacts with renewed vigour. mr. mamoon mentioned other problems and suggested solutions with which i totally agree. however, as a member of optimum population trust (uk) and its various parameters to support a viable healthy population i would say that the optimum population of bangladesh is in the region of 30 million rather than 100 million. by the same parameters optimum population of england is calculated to be only about 20 million and no more!
waste management
as i travel through the city early in the morning i have to put my palm on my nostrils in an attempt to guard against the foul odour that wafts its way from a trashcan or a pile of rotting waste lying beside the road. and i am talking about the environment of the port city which still retains its green look. the situation is even worse in the capital. according to the recent news reports, the capital city alone produces 3556 tonnes of solid waste everyday--a staggering amount by any standard.
nobel for obama
the committee that awards the nobel peace prize likes springing surprises. when kenyan environmentalist wanggari won in 2004, the committee explicitly linked peace with concerns about the state of our planet's ecology, a concept that was familiar in environmental circles but rarely discussed elsewhere. bangladeshi banker and economist dr. yunus won it in 2006 for his efforts to alleviate poverty thus promoting peace through the use of microcredit schemes. now the prize has gone to a sitting u.s. president just eight months into his first term. both maathai and yunus told time magazine that obama was a great choice.
dhaka's traffic mess

vat on commercial space
first of all, i would like to thank dr. sn mamun for his letter that was published to draw the attention of the hon'ble finance minister in the daily star on 14th september 2009 under the heading -- vat on commercial space. my congratulations to a sturdy vocalist like him. i also appreciate dr. sn mamun for the way he took a stand against nbr's activities. definitely, this is an illegal imposition of vat by nbr and the nbr officials not only being jealous of us, they are also trying to abolish the business minors through this process of vat collection.
spoilt bgmea
bgmea was seeking tk three billion from the govt to pay eid bonus to the workers. it is because the bgmea has been spoilt by the govt. and the society because it lays the golden eggs. so easy to ask from the treasury; and then create law and order situation, if this appeal is rejected.
habit of blaming
bangladesh is a developing country and it has many problems. in order to manage these, our political parties should come to some kind of consensus. nowadays they are accustomed to blaming each other, rather than coming to the point.
secularism
it is surprising that so many eyebrows are raised when one argues in favour of establishing a secular constitution, which was originally the case post independence. if i may humbly take the liberty of defending such initiative within the scope of this letter, then it is important to point out that secularism embodies two important principles. first, it presents a case for neutrality towards every religion. second, it promotes prohibition of religious associations in state activities. hence, neither a secular constitution prevents a good muslim from practicing his religion in harmony, nor it makes our nation any less peaceful for believing in our respective faith.
coal mining to start!
your front-page report on the matter published on october 6th has at least opened the door of possible open-pit coal mining in bangladesh.
our cricketers in 1971
recently, in a bid to write the biographies of some of our first generation cricketers (for wikipedia), i was searching through the pages of www.cricketarchive.co.uk. i was looking at the scorecards of different 1st class matches played in erstwhile east pakistan during the 60's. with great interest i was reading how our local heroes (halim chowdhury, better known as shahid jewel, shamim kabir, raqibul hasan, daulat-uz-zaman & others) combined with the non bengali players like ma latif, (maharashtra born east pakistan captain) or nasim ul ghani (delhi born pak test player). together, they played against the likes of zaheer abbas, mushtaq mohammad, majed khan & others.
traffic in dhaka
my friends abroad hear me complaining about the traffic in dhaka constantly and they don't get it. actually, unless one lives in dhaka or its suburbs, you cannot even begin to imagine the monstrosity and hopelessness of the situation. there's absolutely no solution in sight and most of the people are rendered captives to the issue. i live at green road and from my balcony every day, i witness a severe gridlock that lasts for hours ! there are a few hospitals in this neighbourhood and sometimes even the ambulances are sitting with their sirens on in this never-ending flow of traffic. if you are a patient in the ambulance or waiting for one - a prayer and a priest might be your only hope.
neglecting animals
i have been utterly flabbergasted by seeing a photo of an emaciated rhinoceros in dhaka zoo recently. i have also come to know that this photo was published in a newspaper in malaysia as well. as i got more irritated (to make it worse) i have learned that two giraffes were dead and more than forty animals in dhaka zoo are in dire straits due to mal-nutrition and lack of professional care. view the page international
