“proper” bangla
it is true that we bangladeshis are the only nation in the world who sacrificed their lives for our mother language, which is bangla. after long 56 years, what we have achieved is a question to many including myself as far as speaking bangla is concerned. majority of bangladeshis hardly speak bangla in their daily life. what we all speak is some sort of distorted bangla in local (ancholik) accent.

our four national leaders, syed nazrul islam, tajuddin ahmed, m mansur ali, and ahm qamaruzzaman (we remember them with due respect)) were killed inside dhaka central jail on november 3, 1975. but only one man is responsible for their deaths! it's heartbreaking and shameful news undermining the sacrifice of the leaders who laid down their lives for our country.

the judicial pronouncement of a bench of the high court has curtailed the authority of the president to appoint the judges. by this judgment the court has ensured the freedom and prestige of the judicial department and has closed the door of the executive branch to exert influence on appointment of judges. this judgment is very important. in the past, we saw that every government exerted influence on all such matters. this tendency of the governments has created a lot of controversy. in these circumstances, such a verdict was much expected. so, we welcome this epoch-making verdict and hope that it will ensure the freedom of the judicial department.
river erosion

subversive politics
i am writing about the incident that took place on the dhaka university campus and in the adjacent areas of it, following the news of tarique rahman's injury, which is totally unacceptable. the people who had vandalised the taxicab and set it on fire, that left one businessman dead, are the so-called students of the university. they remain in the university year after year as student to serve their political parties' interest.

our asif, their bindra
on the eve of participation in any international competition, the officials always say that it is not the prize, rather the participation is the main objective and spirit of the game. we have been hearing this since the independence of our country. and thus we are always satisfied with our dismal results in almost every competition. our results are bad even in saf games, let alone commonwealth or olympics.
detained bnp chief
i would like to comment on the much expected release of the immediate past prime minister begum khaleda zia and her eldest son tarique rahman. from the very beginning of the anti corruption drive, the present military backed interim government arrested a large number of veteran politicians, including bnp, al, jamaat chiefs who were imprisoned for several months. al president sheikh hasina along with jamaat amir moulana motiur rahman nizami were released after a couple of months. unfortunately, bnp chief begum khaleda zia is yet to be released.
uttara gonobhavan
the historic uttara gonobhavan in neglected northern region, consisting of a total of sixteen districts, has been functioning as another presidential palace since the days of president ayub khan of pakistan.
hospitals or death traps?
bangladesh earned fame in terms of establishing some well-equipped reputed hospitals. some of them are highly expensive and one has to pay through the nose. still people try to admit their dear ones in such hospitals with the hope of getting better medicare. alas!! the doctors here pay little attention to the past history of the disease and remain concerned only with the present complaints of the patients. as such it further deteriorates the condition of patients. so instead of being cured, mostly the patients return home unwell due to improper treatment. the so-called consultants have manifold explanations in support of their misdeeds.
attack on ru vc and teachers
it is learnt from the newspaper that shibir cadres assaulted the ru acting vc and some other teachers on 08 july, 2008, when they went to request the shibir men to withdraw a road barricade on dhaka-rajshahi highway at binodpur bazar in rajshahi. this attack was outrageous and has been condemned by all.
harassment in government offices
harassment in the government institutions is a very common in our country. we live in a free country but when we have to go to the government offices, we at once forget about the feeling of freedom due to the rude behaviour of the government officials. we hoped that this government would change the situation, but they disappointed us. it is really sad to know that even a peon can harass a common citizen easily. it is because there is no transparency in the activities of government institutions. without transparency, it will be impossible to think about a welfare state. we see that still so many corrupt officials have been retained in their respective jobs and they seem to be above the law. this kind of disparity encourages corruption all the way. such indulgence always delivers a negative message for our next generation. the prime condition of a welfare state is social justice. the government's attitude should never be negative but we see here the situation is totally different. when a government official does anything offensive, the government will try hard to save him from the allegation and sometimes we saw that such officials were rewarded for their misdeeds. it shows that we are really a failed state.
end politics of violence
i am an international student working part time for a security company. it's a twelve hour night shift. today i am in a construction site. whenever i am in a construction site i am really bored. but nowadays i have a laptop and mobile broadband modem. i can listen to music, have a peep in youtube, and, most important of all, i can browse all the newspapers from bangladesh. before the introduction of internet, i was isolated from my beloved country. as a full time student, life for me is very hectic here.
landslide
landslide is a common affair in our country, particularly in the rainy season. a few days ago 11 people died in chittagong. recently, such a collapse occurred in moheshkhali. so, undoubtedly it is a matter of major concern for us. we expect that the authorities will address the issue with due sense of urgency.
close up 1 and democracy
the other day i was watching close up 1, the talent hunt programme for singers that i very enthusiastically watch every year. the arrangement is satisfactory, for it accommodated public opinion with that of the experts. but i was dumfounded when i saw a singer, tasmih, who in the opinion of the judges scored the highest while in the opinion of the viewers she scored poorly. it was the opposite for her competitor robin who scored substantially less than tasmih but received tremendous compassionate support of the viewers. earlier, robin had very wisely reminded the viewers not to vote for him just as a matter of sympathy for his being lame but to vote for him considering his performance. viewers were not to heed to the appeal and the viewers' love for robin overrode his appeal. ultimately, the outstanding talent of tasmih was subdued by the emotion of the viewers. this is an inherent flaw of democracy that nothing can be done against the popular opinion. however, in this talent hunt programme, i suppose measures were taken to weigh everything carefully to search out for the best. this reminded me of the cardinal bottom line of democracy that in democracy majority must be granted and also the fact that democracy counts head equally not actually what is there in each and every head. yet, in many countries arrangement is made to elect the best of the candidates. when in the developed countries most people are capable of making sound decisions regarding competence of a candidate, the situation is not the same in poor countries where majority of the population are illiterate. in imitating the developed countries we find in most cases that we elect the wrong candidates. despite the unprecedented caution on the part of the administration in the recent local election, there was no significant change. in line with this, it can be presumed that in the parliamentary election also, after two years of preparation, no significant change shall occur. i think our emerging civic society should contemplate as to how to develop a democratic system by which we shall be able to elect the best candidate. no one should feel complacent that the american system is foolproof; it too needs periodic reform to address the time.
delta policies, economics and politics
the delta regions in the world are fertile: low flat fertile lands, plenty of water; and natural fertiliser effect due to silt layers after periodic flooding. farming and agriculture thrive; and the human fertility rate is also higher (higher density of population), providing plenty of human resources. how are we taking advantage of this natural situation?
