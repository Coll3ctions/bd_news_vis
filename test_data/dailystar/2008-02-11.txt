a nandigram near nagpur?
what do you do when you receive an official notice demanding that you surrender your land at a price, which is under one-hundredth its market value? what are your options when the land is your main source of livelihood, and is being acquired for a state-of-the-art airport and special economic zone, which won't remotely benefit you?

bangladesh and eco-tourism
as a destination for eco-tourism, bangladesh is truly hard to beat. for a small country in south asia that is only 144,470 square kilometres, there is definitely a lot to see, enjoy and do here.
our future in test cricket
over the past couple of years, bangladesh cricket team has shown a great deal of promise after the spectacular performances in both the 50 overs and 20 overs world cup in the caribbean and south africa. however, all our hopes were shattered after their dismal performance recently against the kiwis in new zealand. even though they won the t-20 match against the kiwis, they however proved their inconsistency in the other formats of the game. i think we all know that this young bangladeshi team is extremely talented, after seeing their amazing performance against great teams like australia and south africa, but they are not making the best use of this talent and the reason behind this, according to me, is their lack of confidence and self-belief. the t-20 format of the game is more suited for teams like bangladesh, as they are used to collapsing suddenly after scoring some quick runs, but this habit of them certainly won't help them in the other versions of the game and we have seen a lot of disasters occurring due to this.
bird flu
bird flu has not only created health hazards but also made a very unfavourable impact on the rural economy, where thousands of affected chickens have been culled to prevent possible transmission of the decease to humans.
graves of the martyrs
i would like to draw attention to the news item titled 'freedom fighter lt. col. qadir's grave traced after 36 years' published in the last column of page 16 in the daily star of 19 january 2008. in 1971, i was about 13 years old and lived with my parents in chittagong and had near similar experience as nadeem qadir. now i am working at the directorate general of health services, dhaka.
ctg's efforts
i commend the efforts of the ctg to put out of circulation the corrupt politicians of bangladesh through the legal process. i also commend their courage to take on the two autocratic ladies who thought they were beyond the reach of the law. when sheikh hasina says that if voted to power she would continue the current anti-corruption drive and reform process, its credibility to me is a big zero.

epr
the lawyers' uniform opinion that, "trial of a crime, which had been committed before the promulgation of the emergency power act, cannot be held under the ambit of emergency power rules", defies all common sense and appears against all moral precepts.
ru students' campaign
it is great to see that the bangladeshi youth is taking steps to promote two of the greatest natural resorts in the world. enhancing the publicity that these destinations receive is an important step towards promoting tourism in bangladesh.
advertisements
nowadays many people say that they like advertisements, rather than movies. i appreciate it. but my point of writing this letter is that after watching these advertisements, i could guess, that they cannot even remember the name of the product which has been advertised. so, i think the advertisers should concentrate on publicising the qualities of the product or on the theme they want to uphold.
dialogue
the demand of the political parties to start a dialogue without any condition sounds good but there should be a guideline and well-defined agenda for discussion. the political parties must realise that there is no scope in future to run any government driven by the whims and caprices of the party in power.
ditf anomalies

chief adviser dr. fakhruddin ahmed and army chief gen. moeen u ahmed have called upon the ngos to write off the loans or to put off the collection of payment of loan instalments from the cyclone affected people for a period of four months on humanitarian grounds.
university teachers
i myself am an educator, and once taught at the university of dhaka. i know from my experience, many of the university teachers in bangladesh waste much of their valuable time doing dysfunctional politics. i believe time has come for the government and the people of the country to clean up the mess on the campus, bring academic law and order back to the campus, and ensure that the universities can never be used as the centres of dirty politics by the politicians in the future.
smoking
many smokers argue that cigarette smoking is a gift of modern times, and it is a fashion nowadays. some of them claim that it increases the concentration to work. but their arguments are indeed baseless. medical studies have confirmed that there is a direct link between nicotine, which is present in tobacco, and high incidence of heart attack and cancer in smokers. these are dreadful diseases, and even the innocent non-smoking people around the smokers can be harmed by them. so, we have no moral right to smoke in public places.
