the pollution in our rivers
our rivers are in a bad state, have been for a long time. that is not surprising, seeing that we have been concerned about the situation for years. what now appears to give it a new twist is the result of a survey carried out on some of the rivers, 25 in total. predictably, the quality of the water in the rivers has dwindled to a precarious state. worse is the knowledge that some of these rivers may actually have reached a point where they are no longer capable of nurturing or supporting aquatic life forms in them. the pollution in the buriganga, turag and norai -- and these flow by the nation's capital -- has grown to an extent where no life forms can survive in their waters. that is the stark finding by a group of researchers after a three-year survey of the 25 rivers in question. obviously, the oxygen levels in the buriganga and in parts of the turag and norai have declined to a dangerous level. where 4 to 6 levels of oxygen are required for local fish species to survive, the oxygen level in these rivers has now declined precipitously to less than one per microgram.
pak-afghan tension

for the leaders, by the leaders, of the leaders
today, let us deliberate on "democracy," the mysterious word, being used by all sorts of "minority" people in the world to perpetuate their rule over the "majority" with … mere promises. but before getting involved in the fracas let us make some changes in the definition of democracy that was articulated by abraham lincoln. democracy is no more "for the people, of the people or by the people." today, "people" are mere pawns in chess and i am sure you will not differ with me. so, let us say: "democracy -- for the leaders, by the leaders, of the leaders."
food market: fire and farsightedness
it's now a well-established fact that most of the countries of the world are grappling with the crisis of three fs: food, fuel and farming. in fact, after decades of a modicum of calm in the international market for food, the sudden volatility and its ferocity has seemingly changed the whole course. real prices of food are still below their mid-1970s peak, but reached their highest points since then. for example, food price index calculated by fao rose nearly 40% compared to 9% the year before, and prices in the first months of 2008 again increased drastically.
transition is messy, reversible, but real
pakistan stands at a crossroad. it could either shift to wholesome democratisation, or lapse back into military-dominated half-civilian government. long-term social trends favour democratisation. but the actual outcome will depend upon how the main actors -- president pervez musharraf, pakistan people's party (ppp) co-chair asif ali zardari, and pakistan muslim league (nawaz) chief nawaz sharif -- play their cards. view the page sports
