tac freezing on its tracks?
the high court judgement declaring the formation and operation of the truth and accountability commission illegal raises a number of questions about the caretaker government's drive against corruption. when tac was formed, it was given out that because of the heavy load of cases being dealt with by the anti-corruption commission, the truth and accountability commission would be pitching in with help. and that would be by way of having people accused of graft confess to their crimes before the body, return their ill-gotten gains to the state and thus be eligible for pardon. at the time when the tac idea was floated, misgivings were expressed about both its raison d'etre and its aims. it was pointed out that the commission was far removed from the concept that had gone into the making of the truth and reconciliation commission in post-apartheid south africa because the latter involved unifying a racially and politically fractured nation. no such reality was at work in bangladesh.

the melamine test?
i was quite confident that the test of melamine in baby powdered milk outside bangladesh would never solve the problem. it is difficult to keep full confidence on outside tests. they are too vulnerable to influence to give a result which might be accurate and trustworthy. this is exactly what has happened. the court has ordered a retest in our country's three reputed organisations on whom at least i have more confidence than the organisations outside the country, especially international organisations which serve multiple interests.
never ending controversy

myanmar's stand
the news item titled “myanmar worked in that area from before?” published in your daily on 10 november has attracted my attention. if that is the case, then what did our navy/bdr do? they should have noticed it immediately at the time when myanmar initiated the survey. this is their holy duty to patrol the border areas 24 hours a day to monitor trespassing, smuggling and any other illegal activities.
regional issues
in the early nineties, with the break-up of the soviet union, three regions in georgia like chechnia in nearby russia declared independence. the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia broke away from georgia and were continuing their independence with the help of russian federation. south ossetia and abkhazia have a common border with the russian federation, whereas north ossetia is in the federation. russia is ruthlessly suppressing the chechen revolt, but on the other hand contrastingly supporting similar revolts in south ossetia and abkhazia.
food culture
according to bertrand russell 'culture is what we do' -- a universal appeal to humanity. ethnically and culturally we are bengali but as a nation bangladeshi, and we always like to go with russell's theme about culture. our main or staple food i.e. rice is now spreading all over this planet.

dealing with traffic problems
on last saturday(08.11.08) i had to travel from gulistan to jatrabari by bus, i was expecting to have less traffic jam as it was weekly holiday and i was quite happy with the thought. but as i reached sayedabad the bus suddenly came to a halt. i looked out from the window and found a large procession, at first i thought it to be a political one, but as the bus moved forward i found it to be a procession of '' safe highway movement'' with a large number of school children carrying colourful placards and banners together with their guardians and teachers and they were escorted by smartly turned out women police and cavalry of police dept. because of the large procession, movement of vehicles in the entire area became severely disrupted, causing misery to the commuters. instead of being motivated by placards and banners, the helpers and drivers of the bus started cutting jokes with each other regarding the procession.
don't expect too much
call us pessimists; we don't anticipate much change in quality governance when a new government takes over from the caretakers following elections next december. it would be the return of either of the two begums, dramatically freed of all accusations much to our dismay, honing now to make up for the 'lost time.'
look east, not west
no more economic pilgrimages to the west. look east: where more human resources are available at cheaper rates. the glitter and the glamour of the usd have drowned in its own secret misery. truth is naked and unvarnished.
consultant for padma bridge
it is a commonly held view in our country that the international development financing agencies are keepers of superior knowledge and technology. with due deference to them, i would like to express my deep concern on the river training works that have been proposed by the adb recommended consultant for the padma bridge. it is rumoured that the proposed works consist basically of dumping sand filled bags. well, this and many others innovative models have been tried and tested by international experts in the jamuna-padma river under different donor-funded projects. all these innovations have failed to stand up to the mighty river. if the rumour has any substance, the proposed river training works and the risk of its failure would put the bridge and associated facilities in danger thus jeopardizing a huge investment. with less robust river training the initial investment will no doubt be less but the whole-life cost would be high, not to mention the huge burden of recurring capital maintenance. who will fund and manage this huge undertaking year after year after the completion of the bridge?
obama and our intellectuals
it would appear that the election of barack obama has galvanised the intelligentsia of bangladesh.
27th bcs

it is so much frustrating to see that political leaders do not learn from the past. the way they are speaking is so irritating that we do not see any ray of hope. i am so surprised that they want to force the government to change some important points of rpo that are in favour of public interest. they are talking like dictators. i do not know what they mean by democracy. they have no respect for the country and the people. they have no shame to lie to the general people again and again in their speeches. view the page international
