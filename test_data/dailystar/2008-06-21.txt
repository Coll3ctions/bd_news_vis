adoption of rti ordinance - a welcome act
the caretaker government must be complimented for approving the right to information ordinance in principle. commitment shown by this government, especially the chief adviser, is highly praiseworthy. we believe the ordinance will go a long way in strengthening the foundation of 'people's right to know' and thereby lay the foundation of an accountable government. the very purpose behind the ordinance, one for which individuals and groups of citizens have struggled long and hard, is to enable people to come by the information they need in their own as well as in the national interest. we have written earlier of the good that will accrue to the country through the adoption of a right to information act. we have in these months of deliberations on the rti maintained that citizens in a democratic society hold the right of access to information. that right, we believe, can now be ensured through an expeditious and efficient implementation of the rti ordinance.

success of dialogue can ensure democracy
the necessity of a meaningful dialogue between the ctg and the political parties at this moment of the nation's history can hardly be overemphasized. with sheikh hasina's temporary release, al circle is now willing to participate in the dialogue. but the unrelenting attitude of the khaleda-led bnp to join any dialogue without begum zia's unconditional release tagged with her two sons' treatment abroad has almost stalled the dialogue process, going as far as stalling the prospect of an election through participation of all the parties.
obama's dream
consistent with his belief that one should have the audacity to hope, senator barack obama has eventually emerged as the first afro-caribbean to be the presumptive nominee of a major us political party. it has been an uphill task but he has hung on doggedly. he has soldiered down the campaign trail, with stops to explain, denounce and detach himself from some of his surrogates along the way.
let's resolve differences and hope for the better
most political observers reckon that bangladesh may have plunged into yet another period of political uncertainty. it is probably naive to expect that the present caretaker government will be able to put an end to these long periods of political deadlock very easily. however, with the departure of sheikh hasina for treatment abroad and the expected release of begum zia and her two sons, perhaps there is a glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel. some may criticise the caretaker regime for flip-flops, but an overwhelming majority may approve of "constructive engagement" with the two major parties, so that we can finally have an agreement that will make our elections conform to modern democratic practices, and their results will be accepted without the rancorous disputes we normally see in our country. bangladesh needs to move beyond the corruption scandal. but before it does, the people have to know exactly what happened, regardless of the precise legality of each case. view the page sports

rationale for a revised police act

is biodiversity conservation mere tree plantation?
biodiversity conservation projects are designed to change something, to protect biodiversity. one of the major differences between biodiversity conservation projects and other projects, however, is that some people think it is often difficult to define -- in clear, operational terms -- precisely what it is that biodiversity conservation projects are trying to achieve. in a business setting, the project goal is usually financial profit and it is usually pretty easy to evaluate how much money a company is making or losing. but for biodiversity conservation projects, what practical and meaningful measures of project impact are available to us? in many fields, the cause-and-effect relationships between specific interventions and resulting impacts are easy to see. they are not so apparent in conservation. this makes it difficult to measure the impact of a project on the biodiversity in a given area.
tropospheric ozone and air pollution
ozone is one of the highly reactive gases, which is photo chemically active. it is composed of three atoms of oxygen (o3) and its role depends on its location in the atmosphere. this gas plays a different role in the lowest two layers of the atmosphere, known as the stratosphere and troposphere. in the stratosphere, above the tropopause about 90 percent of the ozone protects life on earth from the sun's dangerous ultraviolet radiation. in contrast, the layer surrounding the earth's surface is the troposphere where the presence of ozone is harmful for the environment as well as for human health.
