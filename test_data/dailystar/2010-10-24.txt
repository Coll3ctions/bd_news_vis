children living below the poverty line
one does not need much wisdom to know how vulnerable bangladesh's children are to a host of circumstances. and that is a truth which once more has been highlighted, this time through the grim statistics provided by unicef. over three crore children in the country are condemned to live in dire poverty, which is as much as to say that they subsist below the poverty line. now, with 45 per cent of the country's population comprising children and with 46 percent of those children leading lives that are way below accepted definitions of poverty, the risks to which our children are exposed are all too manifest. add to these worries those which have patently been brought out into the open by last friday's issue of the star magazine, which informs us in no uncertain terms that the problems which children and mothers face in bangladesh are related not just to hunger. there are too such crucial issues as under-nourishment and malnutrition. how else should one explain the fact that as many as 43 percent of children in bangladesh happen to be too short or stunted for their age?
