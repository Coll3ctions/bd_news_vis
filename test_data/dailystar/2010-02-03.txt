prevent misuse of gas
it is becoming clear day-by-day that gas reserve in bangladesh will be finished within a few years. one of the main reasons of this rapid depletion of gas reserve is the misuse of gas in every sector. people as well as government are equally responsible for this terrible situation. too many people do not turn off their gas burners to save a matchstick!
global warming
global warming is now major issue. it can only be countered if people stop pollution, stop harmful gas emissions by reducing the large number of industries that emit harmful gases including sulphur dioxide, carbon mono-oxide and also many other gases that severely affect the environment. people of the world should at least take small actions to reduce the bad effects of global warming. if no one takes any action against global warming then bangladesh and the countries in the world will suffer a lot and the condition of those countries may become unmanageable.

bnp's posture
the secretary general of the bnp and his party members are talking about selling of bangladesh to india, ever since india and bangladesh signed a joint declaration following the visit of sheikh hasina. they know it very well that a country cannot be sold in a market. therefore, if the bnp takes the liberty to spread lies, they must be prepared to listen to any kind of allegation against them in response to their wild and untrue allegations against the government.
low cost hydropower
a write-up on the interesting subject was published in a local english daily on january 21st. however, the writer was not very clear on the subject matter. were these related to conventional hydro-power plants across the rivers sangu, matamuhuri and mohamaya; or these power plants were to be driven by river currents, and located on barges or on shore? it left the write-up rather difficult to understand! the exact nature of the proposed plants needed clearer definition.
indo-pak borders
reference to the border skirmishes between india and pakistan. these two prominent neighbours of south asia should revive the peace process. it is in the interest of both the countries to stop the blame game for political benefits and come to the table for talks. both the neighbours share common culture and history, which should help them to ease tension and move forward towards progress and prosperity. a vast majority of people are keen to have a peaceful relationship with each other. quest for peace will help reduce the vast budgets allocated for defence and the same can be used for other purposes like eradication of poverty and illiteracy, electricity, clean water etc.

poor cricket
i believe sewhag was absolutely right when he said the bangladesh was an ordinary side. look at the way ashraful batted in the second test. i would like to drill it into the minds of the bcb for the last time that "ashraful will never change". i am not a cricket player, but even i have enough common sense to realize that bangladesh were four early wickets down and survival was the key. how many times has he gotten himself out like this? it's no use swinging your bat around in anger and cursing. what he should have done was take off his helmet and given himself a good whack in the head! it is because of people like ashraful that sehwag stated that bangladesh is an ordinary side. ashraful does not care about his team and plays for his own performance. i also disagree with jamie siddons that there are no replacements for ashraful. what about aftab ahmad, alok kapali or the other icl players? i was also surprised to see the way shakib played a wide delivery to get himself out. this is not expected from a top international player.

my lost letter!
this is to thank the daily star for its dedicated website. four years back my first-ever letter to any newspaper was published in the daily star on its 6 october, 2006, issue. ever since that letter was published, people's outlook about me and my own outlook about life totally changed quite a lot. but unfortunately, i completely forgot the day and the month of the publication and was confused about the year, while i have been in great need of that daily star issue recently. as i forgot the day and month of the publication, i was rummaging through the old issues of the daily star but to no avail. tired, i was almost giving up the hope of retrieving the letter anymore when i luckily came across the search box and thus, to my utter happiness, found what i was looking for so long. mere words are not enough to express my rapture upon looking at my old letter.
royal bengal tiger
it is very pathetic that we don't hesitate to kill our national animal “the royal bengal tiger.” i was struck with wonder to hear that at a village in sathkhira the local people killed our pride “the royal bengal tiger”. in fact, the forest department personnel are not skilled enough, therefore when a tricky situation arises things go beyond control. moreover, the way we are cutting down trees and destroying forests, the animals will soon have no place.
