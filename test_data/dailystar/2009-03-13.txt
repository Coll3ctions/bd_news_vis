k l's move is worrisome
the malaysian government's decision to cancel visas already granted to bangladeshi workers is a serious blow not only for the workers but for the nation as a whole. at a time when bangladesh has been exploring various avenues, especially through its manpower sector, to solidify its economic base, the move by kuala lumpur can only pour cold water on our collective aspirations. we of course realise that the malaysian authorities have their own economic compulsions in view of the on-going global recession. at the same time, we fail to accept the argument that those already granted visas to travel to malaysia and work there can be dealt with in such cavalier fashion. the difficulty for us, though, is that it is a decision made by a country in its national interest, which means that bangladesh does not have much of a say here.
acute water shortage in the capital
it seems that the people living in the capital are destined to suffer from the lack of some essential basic facilities forever. coupled with the severe shortage of electricity, life has become even more unbearable with lack of adequate water supply. some specific areas of the city, particularly the old dhaka area, are suffering more than others. and the members of parliament of the affected areas rightly fear that there might be, as a manifestation of the people's resentment, a general display of public anger against the government for its failure to ameliorate their sufferings.

israel's atrocities
israel's latest offensive is gaza is not an isolated incident. they seem to be very much enthusiastic about killing the innocent palestinians, even on a lame plea. the israeli armed forces call themselves a moral force. the type of morality they have shown through their brutal actions against the lebanese and the palestinian people is far too evident. in an aggression on lebanon in 1982, they killed more than seventeen thousand people most of whom where innocent people. in the same year in a genocide, almost one thousand and seven hundred people were killed in 'slabrashatila ' refugee camp in lebanon. in kana mass killing in 1996, 106 people were killed more than half of them were children. it is worth mentioning that all those killed in the camp were under the shelter of the un. in 1997, an israeli helicopter killed some innocent palestinians in an attack on an ambulance. the israelis claimed there were hamas members in that ambulance which was a complete distortion of truth. during the latest offensive on gaza, israeli soldiers carried out an attack on the refugees taking shelter in a un school killing at least 40, not to mention the total number killed and the trail of destruction left.
sound pollution

having just watched the proceedings of the first session of the national assembly as a veteran citizen, many hopes and dreams arise, as with millions of my fellow countrymen and women, on the expected changes we were starved of during the preceding decades.
education
in view of the recent horrendous massacre at bdr headquarters, repeated attacks by jmb, excesses by jamaat et all, killing of sams kibria, ahsanullah master, grenade attack of 21st august etc, it has become absolutely necessary to impart certain education to the students. they are our future. the idea is to catch them young when they can form opinions.
unacceptable!
this is unacceptable! as if our country does not already have enough problems. and who has created these problems? the very people who are supposed to protect us and our country. how are we to trust them with guns again? if they had issues, then there are ways to handle this. killing people, looting valuables are the work of professional criminals, not border guards i always thought no matter how poor we are as a nation, we were still better off than those living in iraq, afghanistan, pakistan, somalia etc, but now i am beginning to wonder.

pm's decision
prime minister in her question hour informed the house that the government in implementing one of her election pledges will rehabilitate the illegally forced retired officers. this is a most welcome move. the pm specified that dues would be given to the deprived officers. but is that enough? as we know most of such officers winning the court cases are already eligible for such benefits. perhaps now the payments and post facto promotions will expedite. to rehabilitate and also to derive benefit from this move the government may utilize their services; they may be re-posted to sensitive positions where the government needs honest, sincere and committed officers. as we know the present bureaucracy was highly politicised by the past bnp-jamaat alliance government for which they resorted to “ethnic cleansing” forcing exit of brilliant non partisan officers.

wildlife conservation
our forests and wild landscapes face fresh and bigger threats. most of us might not have given a serious thought to wildlife conservation. this should be a serious issue, the touchable and intangible profits we receive from wildlife conservation directly concerns over 70 percent of our country's population who depend upon the traditional occupationrain-fed agriculture.
polybags
the use and production of polybags do a great deal of harm to our environment and drainage system and to air, water and soil. in our country, thousands of pieces of polythene are being used everyday. this huge amount of polythene is neither being re-used nor being decomposed in a natural way. most of the bags are just thrown out after its first use. they find their way into the drains. then the polybags block our drainage system, barricade regular flow of water, obstruct the rainwater flowing into the drains etc. as a result low-lying areas in the cities frequently go under water. flood occurs every now and then. whenever, these polybags go inside the cultivable land, it loses fertility and crops do not grow in such lands. polybags remain unchanged like a curtain through which nothing can pass.

mrp programme
a few days ago, there was a news report published in almost every major daily of the country regarding the machine readable passport programme (mrp) taken up by the bangladesh government. with vision of the modern days it is a must for countries like bangladesh which are ldcs to have mrp as it was learnt that from april 2010 most of the developed countries will not allow the present manual passport which is issued by the government for visa/travel and immigration clearance purpose. from the past experience of our different bangladeshi governments, we have seen that whatever they do, they do it at the pace of a snail and they fail to meet the target on 95% of the time and many excuses are given by the concerned authorities and departments. compared to the total population of the country, the users of bangladesh international passports are probably 8-10% at the most (it's a guess as we do not have any data available of the passport holders of bangladesh). by number this may sound small but it is very important that the present government prioritise this issue and keep our different foreign offices up to date so that bangladeshi wage earners who are living aboard and those who are planning to go before or during this transitional time do not face any difficulty with the foreign immigration departments. the project is also very crucial for our businessmen who are frequent flyers for meeting different buyers for export of readymade garments and other items. view the page international
