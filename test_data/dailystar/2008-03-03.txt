medical ethics
what could be a better occasion for the chief adviser to caretaker government to counsel the new generation of doctors about medical ethics than the 10th convocation of bangladesh college of physicians and surgeons (bcps) held in the city on saturday? keeping in mind the glorious tradition of the medical profession in these parts and seized of the erosion of that legacy through a degree of commercialisation, the physicians' somewhat tarred image needs to be positively enhanced. he talked about qualities of a good doctor like treating patients with compassion, setting examples of humane conduct, protecting dignity and privacy of patients and abiding by the principles of medical ethics.

rmg workers
we feel embarrassed when we read the news that our garment workers block the streets demanding fulfilment of their basic rights. about 7% of our total exportable income comes from the garments sector and this sector also generates about 20% employment. despite all this, no long-term policy has been formulated yet for the betterment of the workers and this industry by the entrepreneurs or the government. should we draw a comparison with other sectors, it will be clear that this sector is not well established, well organised, well salaried (at the workers level), well bonded (between workers & owners) and is based on labour exploitation.
ekushey
claude levi strauss once remarked that the french revolution represents an apocalyptic convergence of the past, the present and the future for france as a national entity. i strongly feel that ekushey february of 1952 is analogous to such an “epiphany” for bangladesh. it captures the essence of our nationality. and to make an end is to make a beginning. history will reveal a pattern that bangladesh is not an ordinary nation among the third world countries to contend with. one can even claim, without any axe to grind, that its people have already proved to be greater than its leaders, who somehow have always failed to measure up to their expectations because of hubris or tragic flaws, inevitably precipitating their downfall.
talk shows on agriculture
the tv channels are holding talk shows on agricultural production, price level and inflation. the marginal farmers who do not have any tv set or any access to information are not really reaping any benefit from this type of talk shows. those who listen to this type of talk shows are well aware. it is better to hold a seminar or a talk show at the village or thana level and deliver the message on the spot.
between the devil….
the general people of bangladesh are facing a real dilemma with regard to the question of holding the next general election. some of our intellectuals and political leaders are appealing for an early election as a solution to the current national crisis, particularly the economic one, and some of them do not want an election just for holding another election, that is, an election must be free, fair and impartial, which will produce a functional parliament, not a dysfunctional one.
the language issue
in response to the cover story "preserving purity" published in the star weekend magazine (on february 22, 2008), i decided to write this letter to convey a few words about this topic. the theme of the cover story was to save the pure bangla which is now getting mixed up with the informal one. actually, language, the way of communication, is based upon change, evolutions and development. so, through formal bangla comes the informal one just like the english not used traditionally in the day-to-day life of the english speaking people. it is not that i am disregarding my own language for which the valiant sons of bangladesh gave their lives but today's generation wants to have an easy path of conversation through which they can express their everything freely. there is a need for formal bangla along with the use of the prevalent one.
forgetting our culture?
nowadays the new generation likes fusion, rap, pop, metal, remix etc.
usaid for crop diversification
according to a recent usaid press release, the united states will undertake a programme involving more than $50 million to help the farmers in the dominican republic learn how to be competitive by growing new crops and manufacturing handicrafts for the global markets.
buriganga tragedy
it is the same old story. launches capsize all too easily and malpractices of owners, iwta, ministry of shipping, police at terminals, and various others are never brought to light, in spite of the so-called committees formed so speedily after so many tragedies in bangladesh. that has not yielded any results which could bring the culprits to book. it is no secret that the majority of the launches do not comply with the authorised specifications/drawings, they exceed their load capacity, bribe the police and are not operated as per marine laws etc. etc.
my experience with doctors
the caretaker govt's drive against revenue corruption and fraud is being pursued in full swing but another corrupt practice of a very grave nature affecting both the revenue of the govt. and the pocket of general masses is being totally ignored. i am talking about the corrupt practices of the doctors, whether for writing prescription or giving specialised services. i am sorry to see that neither the govt nor the medical council, constituted of doctors only, has looked into this social corruption involving our life and death. in the absence of any strong regulatory authority, the doctors are involved in corrupt practices and earning a huge amount of money without paying taxes to the govt. these practices, if left unchecked, will become the greatest social menace.
dhaka- kolkata train service
we welcome the initiative of general moin to sort out differences with the indian authorities. we are optimistic about improvement in indo-bangla relations after his visit.
war criminals & voting right
it seems there is confusion and mix-up on this vital issue of national importance. i am most surprised that even intellectuals and people we regard as having balanced opinion are delivering mixed views.
doctors
giving medicare service to people is a noble profession. people from all walks of life are benefited by sincere health services from the doctors and so they respect the doctors wholeheartedly. in spite of all the limitations, their sincere efforts to give better treatment to the patients are commendable. we should not forget that we live in a poverty stricken country. our govt. with limited resources cannot bring positive changes in the hospitals overnight. in bangladesh, a person can easily get treatment from a government hospital almost free of cost, but in other countries this is not possible. as per the standards of modern medicare the hospitals are not well-equipped with modern instruments, still the doctors are trying hard to give better service with what they have.
kosovo: us role
predominantly albanian muslims recently declared their independence in kosovo backed by the usa and some other european nations. germany, britain, italy, turkey and a few more countries, meanwhile, recognised kosovo as an independent and sovereign country.
hospitals and our leaders
a news item in today's (february 15, 2008) newspapers has attracted my attention. it is on the health condition of sheikh hasina, a former prime minister of bangladesh, who is now in custody suffering from ear and eye ailments and has marginal blood pressure. some physicians examining her in jail have recommended that she be shifted to the bangabandhu hospital for observation and treatment. the ig (prison) has even assured that she can be sent to any hospital of her choice in bangladesh for treatment. but she has stated that she is concerned about her security in a hospital in bangladesh and has expressed her wish to be sent to the us for treatment. zillur rahman, a leader of the awami league, in echoing sheikh hasina's wishes, has even suggested that the party (awami league) will bear all expenses of her treatment in the usa. sheikh hasina has been in the usa, during and after her premiership, for treatment of her various ailments. view the page international
