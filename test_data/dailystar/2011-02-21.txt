a reminder of our values
ekushey is a perennial reminder to us of the values we live by as a nation. and these are values we reasserted in february 1952 through our spirited defence of our language when it came under threat from quarters not too happy about according it the place on the political and social pantheon it deserved. in 1952 and before it, the bengali struggle was not so much against a foreign language as it was a movement against crude attempts to have bangla take a back seat in our national life. the sadness comes in remembering that it took the lives of bengali young men for their language to find its niche in the politico-cultural clime of the times.

amar ekushey precursor of birth of bangladesh
