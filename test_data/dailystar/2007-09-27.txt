dravid's war with himself
it is almost impossible not to compare rahul dravid with shakespeare's brutus, because as captain he seemed to be at war with himself. there was always an aspect to his captaincy where he wondered whether he was doing right by his players. this is the problem with an individual who by nature keeps his feelings to himself, and if he confides at all it would be to people who are close to him. but outside his family, who? maybe if greg chappell, the australian who coached india, had continued he might have helped the karnataka lad come out in the open. that was not to be as greg was pulled into the quagmire that indian cricket can sometimes be.
a brave new india
from no-hopers to world champions - all it took was two weeks for india to traverse the journey. a new captain, a young team, and lack of experience in this format were all touted as reasons why india could not win, but these were weaknesses only on paper; out on the field, each of these turned out to be strengths: mahendra singh dhoni was vibrant and positive in the field, backing his hunches at key moments; the young team added oodles of energy to fielding, while the lack of experience in playing this game freed them of excess baggage and allowed them to learn quickly and formulate customised strategies which they believed would work for them: a prime example was the decision to bat first, even as most experts suggested chasing was the way to go.
