this worsening crisis of electricity
the increasing frequency with which power cuts have been happening over the last few days is extremely worrying. worse is the feeling that the authorities are either unwilling or unable to explain why the situation has come to such a pass where even a month ago it was felt that the supply of electricity had rather improved. that feeling came from the declining power outages, making citizens believe that the crisis could well be on the way to a solution. but those assumptions have now been belied. with power cuts occurring no fewer than eight times a day, it is reasonable to ask the authorities how they plan to tackle the situation. it does not matter that the government keeps telling us the power situation has improved when the realities on the ground show the exact reverse. with the power cuts comes an inevitable effect on water supply. households are now faced with the prospect of not just inadequate electricity but the all too obvious possibility of insufficient water.
recruitment to the lower echelons of health sector
on the back of the furore over the health adviser's ill-conceived announcement of inducting party loyalists in the community clinics, it is a breath of fresh air: the health directorate has stopped recruitment of classes-iii and iv employees in 21 districts. this comes in response to public reaction against anomalies in recruitment procedures. detractors could say that the health directorate has caved in to public criticism; but would the government have stopped the process had it not been itself convinced of the opacity? thus in our eyes' it is a self-corrective move worthy of appreciation. but in any case the government should at all events uphold the principles of fair-play, justice and job-specific eligibilities. view the page sports

sending our army to afghanistan
"of sending men home from the dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged, cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love."
mindless hill cutting
a couple of decades ago, the main attraction of sylhet was the small hills. unfortunately, sylhet is losing its beauty. some powerful land grabbers are cutting hills for their own benefits. local people have said police is not doing anything about it. rather it is an opportunity for them to take bribe from the criminals. the ultimate result of hill cutting will be horrible. many people of chittagong died in mudslides due to hill cutting. may be in future people of sylhet will face the same fate.
eye medicines
bangladesh is a poor country with a huge population. hence many people do not get adequate food and medicine. people cannot afford costly treatment and medicines. a large number of people are suffering from various types of eye diseases. eye treatment is very costly, because most of the medicines are imported from abroad. for treatment of "glaucoma" doctors advise patients to use the medicines alphagan and lumigan for their lifetime, as this disease is generally not curable. it has been observed that the prices of the above medicines increased by about 200% by the importers, and retailers are accordingly charging high prices from the patients. this had caused great concern amongst glaucoma patients in the country. it is feared that the prices will further go up soon.
sick condition of hospitals
it is good that national human rights commission has spotlighted the sick condition of dhaka medical college hospital and the daily star also gave it due coverage. will anybody look into the private hospitals? will anybody tell us what is going on inside those luxurious buildings? any investigating journalist will find horrifying pictures inside these so-called hospitals. people are suffering from wrong treatments, and some are dying because of ignorance of the so-called consultants!
educational institutions
teaching is a very noble profession and teachers are looked upon with much reverence. we used to think that this profession does not have any hazards, but not anymore, the present situation of our country has made us change our minds. now-a-days we frequently hear about teachers being harassed by students, they are physically attacked, get confined, verbally abused and so on. the latest incident was reported in the daily star on september 28, 2010. it described the brutal attack of awami league activists on md. abu taher, principal of tabalchhari green hill college in matiranga upazila of khagrachhari district. it was disclosed that the attackers severely beat him and broke his left leg. since the awami league formed the government, unrest has erupted in many educational institutions across the country. bangladesh chhatra league is clashing among themselves and also attacking chhatra dal and chhatra shibir. we learned that on september 27, 2010 a group of bcl men stabbed an activist of jatiyatabadi chhatra dal on the campus of shahjalal university of science and technology, which left him critically injured. if this is the condition of our educational institutions, then what is the future of the country?
mps and media
your editorial "parliamentarians take a dig at media" dated september 23, 2010 seemed to indicate your surprise at the bellicosity of the ruling party mps towards the media. while i commend your optimism, the reality is that just because of someone is elected does not necessarily make that person a democrat. lest we forget our own history, the inconvenient truth of the matter is that the current ruling party was the first government in our history to ban all newspapers outright, with the exception of the four controlled by its own organs. one may say that all that happened more than thirty years ago, but keep in mind that some of the very mps who voted to ban newspapers in 1974 are sitting on the treasury benches in 2010. if they could get away with it without any scrutiny from the outside world, i am pretty sure they would do it again.
session jam
it is a matter of great regret that owing to session jam students cannot complete their education in right time in bangladesh. as most of the university students come from poor families, it becomes difficult for the families to bear their educational expenses for the extra years. it takes 7 or 8 years to complete a 4-year honours course! political clashes, unwarranted closures, irregular class schedules are some of the major causes behind this session jam. the students of chittagong veterinary and animal science university, jagannath university and rajshahi university are the worst victims of session jam.
border killings
the joint meeting between bdr and bsf, reported in your daily on september 27, seems to have allowed both sides to openly discuss the issue of border killings by bsf. the director general srivastava of bsf considers the civilians being killed at the border as "criminals" and that they are being killed inside the "indian territory". does he imply therefore that it should be of no concern to bangladesh? what kind of justification is this for killing civilian trespassers? it should be remembered that it is against international human rights law to kill an unarmed civilian, even if he/she is a smuggler or a criminal, and it holds independently of whichever territory he/she is found when being killed.
bcl and jubo league
the highly deplorable heinous activities of chhatra league, jubo league elements and some ruling party mps, are continuously shocking us. the recent incidence in pabna is an eye opener and is a classical example of criminalisation of politics. nowadays we find no difference among bcl, chhatra dal and notorious nsf. they behave in the same manner. i voted and will continue to vote for the al, and also influenced many of my friends, relatives to vote for the al in all the elections. it pains me a lot reading about all the incidences perpetrated by bcl, jubo league leaders and workers.i would like to narrate a personal sad and shameful experience of mine while in 2nd year in dhaka medical college. we got admitted in dhaka medical college in 1969. in those days the present bcl was popularly known as mujibbadi chhatra league (mcl), and the other was ' baigganik chhatra league' (bcl). one afternoon in 1972, my hindu classmate and roommate was called out from the room and was planned to be beaten up by some of my classmates belonging to mcl for reasons best known to them. i prevented the beating by asking them as to why they want to beat him up. so, naturally i incurred their wrath. the same night our room was knocked after midnight. i opened the door. on opening, i was suddenly and firmly boxed on the nose by one of our classmates. he was fully drunk and was accompanied by seven/eight of our classmates. the majority were dead drunk. two vomited on the corridor. the boxer classmate of ours brought out a pistol and jabbed the same on my abdomen. they were also verbally abusing me like anything. i was in a near death situation. our another roommate friend pacified them and saved my life. such was the conditions prevailing in dhaka medical college in those days. in the next election of dmc student union, chhatra union (motia) won almost all the seats including vp, gs etc.
america's trap
during our pm's recent visit to the usa, the special envoy to afghanistan and pakistan of the us richard holbrook gave a proposal to our foreign minister dipu moni to send some troops to afghanistan to help the coalition forces there. undoubtedly, it is an american trap and bangladesh must not enter such a trap anyway. america is the super power and can attack any country any time without considering the reaction of the world. america has committed a great sin by attacking iraq and afghanistan and killing thousands of innocent people there. we do not support the activities of the taliban in afghanistan. we strongly believe that their activities are against the spirit of islam but there is no logic for the b&b gang (bush, blair and their accomplices) to send troops there.
pabna whipped
finally the civil administration of pabna got whipped by the political hierarchy allowing the administration little chance to defend themselves. this unprecedented incident will remain as a big blot for the whole civil administration of the country for long to forget and forgive. instead of getting justice they got severe thrashing from the policymakers due to political pressure. it is really painful to read that the advisor of the pm, h.t. imam accused them of crying in front of the civil society and media. by doing this they have violated the code of conduct of the civil administration. my question is don't those people, who are being manhandled and even mercilessly beaten by the political thugs during performing their duties, even have the right to express their sentiment? if this practice keeps continuing in such a manner, people will lose their faith on civil administration, and party politics will take over the whole administration very soon.

a local english daily's 30th september issue had a front-page headline write-up by their staff reporter. it brought back memories of my rat smelling days during my college life. i prefer to share this with the readers, rather than rats involved in politics and legal matters. i will leave it to our political and legal experts to analyse and dissect. i only wonder what rat did bnp smell? was it a live or dead rat? if it was a live rat i believe that it could smell like most furry creatures in the wild, tinged with the smell of earth, to which rats burrow in to avoid other animals, and large birds of prey that might dive down, and make a meal of the rat! dead rats however naturally smell of putrefaction, depending on the interval between the rat's death and its smelling! this smell will be really obnoxious! my experience of dead rats, was related to practical dissection classes in zoology, way back in 1949-50. we had live rats, killed by waste cotton soaked in chloroform, then cleaned with laboratory spirit and mounted on a wax based dissection tray. naturally, these freshly killed rats smelt of chloroform, and nothing else. here too, my knowledge is superficial, since i disliked zoology.

the art of losing votes
let the advice go out to the government: formulating a national media policy is not a good idea. and it is not because of two important reasons. the first, of course, is the government's repeated assertions of its belief in a free press. the second follows from the first, which is that if indeed the government thinks the freedom of the media is conducive to the growth of democracy, it ought not to do anything that even remotely looks like a move to discipline the media.
