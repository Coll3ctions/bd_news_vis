one more cu student dies tragically
the tragic death of yet one more student of chittagong university (it is the third in the last couple of months) is deeply disturbing. it is so because it happened in an unnatural manner, allegedly at the hands of some villagers. it has emerged that the death of asaduzzaman was the result of a confrontational situation between students and villagers, portents for which reportedly existed. adding to the tragedy is the fact that it was a case of mistaken identity that led to asaduzzaman's death. predictably, it led to consequences we are all too familiar with. students of cu went on the rampage which in turn led to a suspension of on-going examinations. moreover, a strike has been called by the bangladesh chhatra league to protest the young man's death.

weekly currency roundup
april 11 - 15, 2010
international markets:
this week marked another topsy-turvy week for the euro. the euro fell against the dollar and the yen on thursday as higher costs to insure against a greek default highlighted persistent concerns about greece's debt problems and cut demand for risky assets. five-year greek credit default swap prices rose to 455 basis points, exceeding a record closing high of 444 basis points hit a week ago, before euro zone members agreed a standby aid package to help athens service its mounting debt. the yield spread between greek and german government bonds also widened to around 406 basis points, with investors demanding a higher premium on greek debt as they clamor for clarity about how the financial assistance would be implemented. view the page metropolitan

save power
i live in a four-room apartment. for last few years i have been using lights in my apartment very sparingly. i only put on lights in rooms which are essential and that too only one lamp and a fan when necessary. my living room lights are usually off unless i have some guests. i was wondering if we all could use electricity very prudently and when and where it is necessary. i think we could all contribute in saving power and bring down the number of power outage in a day. i get surprised when i see many apartments having scores of lights on after dusk which can be avoided.
occupied footpaths
it is very difficult to find any footpath especially of dhaka city which is not occupied by unauthorized people. we always say poor businessmen such as " hawkers" occupy footpath and make them dirty. i agree that they are responsible for making footpath dirty but only partially. but at the same time it is almost impossible to find any footpath in dhaka city which is not occupied by developers and/or where vehicles are not parked. developers not only occupy footpath but also destroy them. i have never seen any developer repair the footpath after their work is finished. moreover, the whole area remains dirty and dusty till the developers finish their work. after the finish of work of one developer another developer starts working nearby. hence, the footpath remains dirty and occupied. the government should strictly enforce the rules so that people can walk through footpaths.
climate change and economy
bangladesh's development efforts have, in recent years, been severely frustrated by the devastating impacts of natural disasters which are a result of climate change. erratic rainfall and deviation in temperature are going to bring critical changes in the country's rice farming pattern seriously affecting crop yields thus causing serious food insecurity, according to experts. a study, conducted by action aid bangladesh, says erratic rainfall in the rainy season is going to affect the food grains production. according to the meteorological office, the country experienced 32 percent less rain than normal during the june-july period the last year. prolonged summer and shorter rainy and winter seasons has only increased the trend of droughts and desertification, inflicting an adverse impact on the country's agro-based economy.
street children
the image of children scouring for metals and scraps in a garbage dump speak volumes about the woefully miserable and pitiable state of the have-nots, especially children. we, as citizens of bangladesh, should hang our heads in shame. that children of seven and eight are forced to sift through hazardous waste on a daily basis to contribute to the income of their families is shocking. it is indeed saddening to know that when they are supposed to be in school, the unfortunate children are wading through used bandages, syringes and old batteries to salvage some metal pieces and plastic containers. the government should take serious note of the inconvenient truth. child rag pickers are deprived of love and education and are at high risk of being exploited by others, especially bandits and those running junkyards. children resort to street life due to their instinct to survive in hard life conditions.
observer crisis
it is heartening to learn that on the basis of the assurance given by the information minister and the law minister, the journalists, press workers and the general employees of the bangladesh observer newspaper have deferred their scheduled fast unto death programme to press home implementation of the agreement till 19 april. it is sincerely hoped that the agreement signed between the owners and the journalists, press workers and general employees of the bangladesh observer will soon be implemented allowing observer employees to take a fresh breath in comfort after several years of suffering!
medical errors
this is one of the areas of medical profession, which keeps them under tremendous pressure, especially the specialists. many countries have this problem, there are many cases where a cancer drug was provided instead of the drug for some other ailment, instruments were left in the body, operation was performed on wrong limb/eye because of lack of co-ordination among the medical staff. in saudi arabia we have people from different countries working together in a single place. hence it is important that the communication should be clear. the employees should undergo regular refresher courses on understanding various factors leading to medical errors. a good labelling system should be in place. a proper integrated approach will definitely help in reducing the number of medical errors.

bangla movies
we have been observing a new trend in our movies for the last couple of years. some brilliant drama directors have turned into film directors which is the main reason behind that improvement. movies like “monpura”, “jago”, “third person singular number” and so on are really attracting our young generation toward bangladeshi movies.
nuclear weapons
with intervention in afghanistan and iraq the united states of america has been able to create a serious threat of instability in the middle east and southeast asia region with chaotic conditions in iraq, afghanistan and pakistan while india and bangladesh are already suffering from its fallout. to some extent, the afghan intervention is understandable but the seizure of iraq defies all logical interpretations. it is almost unpardonable that a power like the usa with extremely sophisticated electronic spying devices and superbly trained manpower for espionage and counter espionage activities would commit the mistake of wrongly assessing the military capability of baghdad as gravely as it did. but, might is right, who would question the mightiest on the earth?
teasers
it is unthinkable in this era of enlightenment that a young man can go so far as to kill a girl for refusing to marry him. our government is up and doing in bringing the crimes committed in 1971 to justice but very much blind to crimes perpetrated by their own men. we know how the youths let loose their libido on the girls of dhaka university, ananda mohon college and jahangirnagar university recently. we do not know how many girls are in the pipeline to be teased, humiliated and ultimately killed. my sister-in-law will never visit my college because she will definite find those golden boys throwing remarks at her. a few days ago the hecklers killed a government college teacher in sylhet for the latter's opposition to a love affair. actually, those hecklers in most cases are the ruling party cadres who are disturbing teachers, students and snatching tender documents all over the country.
deployment of police
after the suicide of another schoolgirl in her madhya nandipara residence on april 3 last, the dhaka metropolitan police (dmp) has deployed plainclothes in front of the city's female educational institutions to stop eve teasing and harassment of girls by delinquents. the home ministry, however, instructed all the law enforcers to take strict measures after the suicide of umme kulsum elora, a 14-year-old schoolgirl, who, repeatedly harassed by some delinquents led by 20-year-old rezaul karim, committed suicide by swallowing pesticide.
ridiculous indeed!
from the star sports on 7th april, 2010 we came to know the turmoil prevailing in the marital functionality of the two stars namely shoaib malik of pakistan and sania mirza of india in detail. sania has always been a controversial figure owing to her sartorial minimization. it's actually a matter of personal belief and practice of any individual but yet both the stars have very murky lifestyles indeed. shoaib was earlier married to an indian muslim girl named ayesha which he tried to deny at first, while sania was betrothed to her boyhood friend, a young man of the same township, which she ignored latter.

save bangladesh
over the last one year, climate change scientists have been sending alarming news that a significant part of bangladesh will be submerged in the next twenty or so years due to the effects of climate change and resulting sea level rise. the bangladesh government is naturally concerned and has been highlighting this perilous problem in national and global forums in an effort to look for solutions. but will this be enough? there is an urgent need to inform the young generation about the implications of the impending crisis since they will be most affected if the gloomy prediction comes true. they will need to play an active role in finding ways to mitigate the adverse impact on our people and society.
nascent democracies
in the nascent democracies military coups are a constant danger. it derails the development of the political institutions which helps to consolidate democracy. it also stalls continuation of the democratically elected governments and erodes international confidence in the nation. the military coup of 1975 was an unexpected development in bangladesh but the political situation gave a few military personnel to embark on this misadventure.
night without end
