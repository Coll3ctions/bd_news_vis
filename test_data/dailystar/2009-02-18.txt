president zillur rahman's move towards easing road traffic during vvip movements is admirable. given the horrendous proportions that traffic congestion in the capital has acquired in recent weeks and months, the presidential action, especially considering the plight of ssc students, should make a difference in the way vvip movements are organised. the presidential entourage in its movements will now keep the interests of citizens uppermost in mind. even as we appreciate the presidential gesture, we would like all concerned authorities to take a cue from this and try and conduct movements of high dignitaries in a way, albeit with full attention paid to security detail, that public mobility can be eased on such occasions.

oppressed rmg workers
a caption with photo published in the back page of the daily star of february 8 has appalled me. i came to know from the story of the report that the female garments workers of a factory at banani in dhaka are not allowed to use sandals during their lunch break so that they cannot go far away. it is very tough and tormenting to walk barefoot on the rough pavements. the factory authorities argue that if the workers are not allowed sandals, they will return to their work in time! such type of treatment is very barbaric and inhuman. we all condemn this strongly. this behaviour reminds us of the infernal days of slavery. we know that the garments workers contribute a lot to national economy. they toil to keep the economy stable. but unfortunately they are treated very badly. they do not get their dues. their salary is very poor and even they do not get their salary in time. sometimes they need to take to the streets to realize their wages. the working conditions are not conducive at all. actually, they work in sweat shops. the owners as well as the government do not address their problems sincerely. they are always neglected. actually, the owners need to ensure their rights to enhance their productivity that will be a win-win situation for the workers and the owners of the factories. the ngos and human rights groups should come forward in this regard.

those bangladeshi-americans
i'm writing in support of what was written in the daily star recently about the ex-u.s. president george w. bush with a little caveat. it is true that bush left the office not only with the lowest approval rating, but also with a lasting damage done to the united states and the world community, in general. particularly, he has done more damage to the islamic countries including bangladesh than any other us president, except, probably, richard nixon opposing our liberation war in 1971. ironically, it is the us muslim community that brought bush an arrogant, unintelligent and ignorant individual - to the white house. it is still debated among the american muslim community that had 537 florida muslims including bangladeshi-americans, not voted for this mediocre texan, the us supreme court could not have made him the president. after a series of flawed recounts, 537 votes separated bush from gore, but we may never know the actual number. although the democratic party contender al gore won the popular vote in spite of the muslim rejection, he lost the presidency due to a controversial loss in the electoral college votes resulting from a number of unfavourable and unfortunate events including the 20,000 or so discarded butterfly ballots, the irregularities in counting the votes through entire florida and, ultimately, the refusal of the five supreme court justices to recount the controversial florida county votes. in the aftermath of the election, the first independent recount was conducted by the miami herald and usa today. they found that if all votes where the intent of the voter was clear were counted properly, gore would have won, using any consistent standard for 'clear intent of the voter'. that's a different story. view the page international
