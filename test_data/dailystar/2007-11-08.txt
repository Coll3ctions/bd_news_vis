musharraf should put the nation before himself

the ten-year itch
general pervez musharraf has surprised even his biggest ally and staunchest backer by carrying out yet another coup, this time against himself, and this time with his feet firmly planted on the ground, or at least that is what he would have us believe. as coas he has suspended the constitution of 1973, which, as the president of pakistan, he had taken an oath to defend. in doing so he, like other military dictators who preceded him, has sought to perpetuate his regime. democracy, in whatever form that existed in pakistan, has once again been subverted.
back from the future
on monday nov 5, rumours about a military coup swept through the country like wildfire, they were false. paraphrasing mark twain, "the rumours about musharraf's exit were greatly exaggerated." military men (and not necessarily generals) in third world countries see themselves as potential saviours of the nation, very few get the opportunity (or have the courage) to translate their dreams into reality.
the state of the media in bangladesh
three decades after my professional involvement with bangladesh media began, the situation still remains difficult and complex. as a journalism teacher at dhaka university, i saw a bangladesh, which was just recovering from massive political turmoil; one party rule, military coups and ban on all newspapers barring state owned ones. censorship, license, and advice on what could be written and what could not, were rampant. since then, the media and the state have grown, but the lack of cohesion among the different social forces that can make a successful state is still a matter of concern. it's not about being pessimistic, but the reality of unrealised dreams hurts us all. view the page sports
