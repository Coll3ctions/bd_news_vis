hosni mubarak goes, finally
after tunisia, it is now egypt that has accomplished the seemingly impossible task of removing a long-serving autocrat from power. the fall of hosni mubarak eighteen days after egyptians began to come together on january 25 to bring his regime down is remarkable not just for the people of egypt but also for the region as a whole. rare has been the instance of people rising in revolt against entrenched regimes. with both tunisians and egyptians now having proved the determination with which they can do away with governments that do not fulfill their expectations, it is clear that a new era of popular participation in the politics of the middle east is at hand.

weekly currency roundup
feb 6-10, 2011
international markets:
the dollar rose broadly on thursday, boosted by better-than-expected u.s. employment data, while the euro slumped as investors worried about europe's lack of progress in tackling a sovereign debt crisis. sterling fell against the dollar after the bank of england left interest rates at a record low despite chatter about a possible hike, and traders said a recent spike in u.s. yields set the dollar up for further near-term gains. u.s. growth picked up in late 2010 and expectations of even brisker expansion this year have driven up bond yields to about nine-month highs, though the u.s. federal reserve has failed to signal plans to cut short a $600 billion bond-buying program. adding to the optimism, u.s. claims for first-time jobless benefits fell in the latest week far below forecasts, data showed. the euro, which hit a 12-week high above $1.38 earlier this month, struggled as investors drove portuguese bond yields to their highest level since the currency was introduced in 1999. portugal is considered at risk of becoming the next euro zone country to need a bailout, and investors are anxious about a lack of progress by policymakers in addressing a euro zone debt crisis. european leaders are to meet next month to discuss bolstering a 440-billion euro bailout fund for troubled countries view the page metropolitan

knowledge corner
conquering space
the roots of space exploration lie deep in the history of the world. ancient astronomers observed points of light that appeared to move among the stars. they called them planets. even the first rockets owe their origin to the invention of gunpowder in china (10th century ad). wernher von braun was one of the leading figures in the development of rocket technology. von braun was the leader of the “rocket team” which developed the v2 ballistic missile for the nazis during world war ii. in 1960 von braun by then in the us, received the mandate to build the giant saturn 5 rockets. so he became the chief architect of the saturn 5 launch vehicle, the super booster that would propel americans to the moon. wernher von braun is generally regarded as the father of the united states space program.

sec ought to be stringent
thanks to our finance minister for his timely intervention to quell the capital market which has been going through a rough-and-tumbled weather due to massive slides in the prices of almost all shares. the minister came up with proposals on how to bring reforms and revitalise the market and safeguard the interest and confidence of the investors. we earnestly hope that his concrete and meaningful suggestions will help to alleviate the hitherto dwindling market and bring stability and confidence, especially amongst the retail investors. his package of reforms is indeed laudable provided those are implemented immediately and monitored correctly on a regular basis. his scraping of book building systems for the time being is also a good step which has been until now manipulated by a few companies.

dirty culture of false cases
internationally famous person dr. yunus is facing false cases one after another. if a person like him is the victim of false cases, imagine the condition of the common people. i have seen criminals are using court to punish the innocent people and i think everybody of the society share my experience. if people working in our judiciary want to improve its image they should come up with agenda aiming to stop false cases. responsibility of judiciary is to help the helpless people, but unfortunately, helpless people of our country are the victims of our judiciary. for example, thousands of farmers of our country lost their lands to the land-grabbers and developers and our government, politicians and intellectuals have been watching this crime for decades. poor farmers cannot raise their voice because land grabbers and developers can easily put them in jail by filing false cases. rape victims and acid victims hardly get justice in this country because criminals are usually rich (financially) and can hire famous and efficient lawyers.

beware of short-cuts!

the way of all dictators
