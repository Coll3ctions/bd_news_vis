ten days of dialogue between the palestinian movements ended without any real and substantial results. all the parties came with the will to succeed in the dialogue but there were too many obstacles that prevented such success. the main obstacles that prevented any progress in the talks were: view the page star books review
savagery unparalleled in human history
letters from the war zone have always been heartbreaking. despite all the old yarn about wars being adventures in courage and vanquishing the enemy being a proud tale of heroism, there is the sheer loneliness that comes through in the missives of those who write back home. so it was in 1971, as this rich collection of poignant letters makes obvious. but what does shine through all along is that sure grasp of hope that these letter writers demonstrate in their communication with their families and friends. that their belief in freedom is unalloyed, that bangladesh will soon be a free nation, is the common principle which binds all of them together.
notes of nostalgia
it is indeed a phenomenal success for a person who, having crossed fifty, can look back at his childhood and youth and then present an honest portrayal of his success and failures during those days in engrossingly simplified language. he deserves to be called an accomplished individual. that is exactly what my impression is about my author-friend, junaidul haque. well, there is nothing surprising as far as my personal understanding of junaidul haque is concerned. the english department of dhaka university, during our days, could be reasonably proud of having students like junaid. junaid, a tall man always wearing power glasses, gave us all an impression that he was flawless a character, cut out for serving a higher purpose. his literary insight and deeper contemplation of the metaphysical aspects of life made him a serious man. in the first story of this book, he wonders why people become old, why they suffer painful diseases, why there is unbearable helplessness in old age. he asks, “couldn't god make us all ever young?” he also has seen some of his close relatives dying before him, leaving a score of questions in his mind which eventually made him a melancholic man. in the book, as he unfolds his own life, he admits that he has been so preoccupied with the unresolved puzzles of life that he has been unable to avail the share of joy he is entitled to.
