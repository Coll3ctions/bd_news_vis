not by visa alone
nawaz sharif, former prime minister of pakistan, is touching upon subjects which leaders in his country and india intentionally avoid. his suggestion to pakistan to unilaterally lift restrictions on travels by indians is bold and timely. tension between the two countries is far less than before and there is a pronounced desire to come closer to each other. the muslim league which nawaz sharif heads is a concomitant with fanatic elements. some have strong anti-india views. for him to ignore their bias is courageous. yet, the hardheaded politician as he is, his ears are plugged to the ground. he is convinced that an average pakistani wants to befriend india. he has tested this sentiment when, a few years ago, he swept the polls against the late benazir bhutto on the plank that the vote for him was a vote for friendship with india. she had then taken an opposite stand. nawaz sharif has said that asif ali zardari, co-chairman of the ruling pakistan people's party (ppp), also supports his proposal. zardari or any ppp minister should come out with some statement to confirm their support. it is, however, strange that prime minister yousuf raza gilani has made no statement to express his views on how to improve relations with india. prime minister manmohan singh, whose visit to pakistan is awaited anxiously by islamabad, said a few weeks ago that he was ready to travel to the other side provided there was something important to sign. the abolition of visa can be worth a visit. view the page sports

of values that used to be, of culture that yet remains
old values are what syed moqsud ali speaks of in this narrative of what has been a fruitful life. in a work that encompasses an entirety of a family tale, the writer in essence brings forth all the traditions, as it were, that once were an underpinning of life in this country. these are the writer's memoirs and yet they could be interpreted as expressions of the sentiments that have bound bengali families and clans together for ages. all history begins with the personal before broadening out to a wider swath of experience. and that is the point which ali makes at the beginning of his narrative. he goes out in search of his roots and comes away from the density of tradition enriched in terms of his discovery. it is discovery that most, if not all, of us can relate to. there is that identification not just with class but with the accompaniments of aspirations which come with it as well.
rereading an account of a long-ago war
retired indian lt. gen. j.f.r. jacob is a tactful guest. invited by coas gen. moeen u ahmed for the 26 march celebrations, a nice gesture, jacob at a press conference complimented bangladeshis by saying that “freedom fighters' gallantry… liberated bangladesh from pakistan occupation.”
a puzzle swathed in enigma
“for everything that exists there are three instruments by which the knowledge of it is necessarily imparted: fourth, there is the knowledge itself, and, as fifth, we must count the thing itself which is known and truly exists. the first is the name, the second the definition, the third the image...” -- plato, epistle vii
a story of perpetual discrimination
the title of the book is most meaningful as it relates the stories and events that actually took place to deprive the minority community of its rights and titles of property ownership. a research based book, it is outstanding in nature as it provides an account, with facts and figures, of how the protective security of the minority has been ignored for years together and how the minority community has been unable to enjoy the property handed down to it from one generation to another.
