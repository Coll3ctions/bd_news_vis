essence of lailatul baraat
muslims will be observing lailatul baraat tonight with due religious fervour and solemnity. it will be time once again for the community as a whole to remember the almighty and remember too the core of the message coming out of islam. the message is one of leading a life of purity, away from all worldly temptations and in all the consciousness that life on earth is but a preparation for life in the hereafter. and yet it is on how men and women conduct themselves in the temporal world that their spirituality or awareness of faith in its widest meaning depends.
the insufferable traffic jams

adapting new methods for learning science
traditionally, learning science has been perceived to be difficult. there are two reasons for this difficulty. first, common-sense intuition, based on our day to day experience with the world around us, frequently leads to wrong conclusions when one tries to explain scientific phenomena through them. scientific intuition, necessary for explaining science, has to be developed through careful and systematic study. second, preconceived notion (frequently based on common-sense intuition) is difficult to change. medical imaging studies have shown that as people learn, permanent changes take place in the neuron pathways of the brain, i.e. in the way in which neurons fire to transmit messages. certain pathways become more robust as a result of learning. later attempts at changing these pathways frequently fail. thus, developing correct scientific intuition must be done early, preferably at the grade school level.

commercialization of bengali literature: mercenary writers and publishers
although there rage furious debates as to when precisely the golden age of bengali literature was, one thing is sure: contemporary bengali literature is at its farthest point from it. we don't really know how we may symbolize this stage of our literature! with our printing media coming under the powerful influence of its electronic cousin, pieces of classic bengali literature are surviving on the whims of electronic media and thereby fall prey to indiscriminate dissection at the hands of second- and third-rate serial soap opera makers. while it may be saving them from sinking into oblivion, it is at the cost of distortion. increasing public interest in audio-visual media has given rise to serious misunderstandings about the consequence on our poor literature. the existence of bibhutibhushan's pather panchali or tagore's ghare baire owes more to the celluloid versions of satyajit ray than the old printed texts which are only gathering dust on the library shelves. these classic books are reportedly reaching wider audience by turning into films.
kali o kolom srabon 1415--july 2008
this issue of kali o kolom continues to demonstrate the literary journal's inherent vitality and variety. a most interesting piece is the essay titled purbobongo progoti lekhak o shilpi shangha penned by mohammed nazrul islam. it takes the reader on an emphatic tour of radical politics and cultural activities that formed the locus of oppositional politics in the then east pakistan against the west pakistani regimes during the 1940s and '50s. the cast of characters is vivid, ranging from dhirendranath dutta (the man who first raised the issue of language and linguistic rights in the pakistan parliament) to khan shamsur rahman (an ex-csp bureaucrat who wore a red tie to a leftist meeting in swadarghat near the baptist mission church in old dhaka) to hasan hafizur rahman (the poet-activist who brought out the famous ekushey collection of poems, and was later posted to the bangladesh mission in moscow), with the settings ranging from kolkata to chittagong to dhaka, and the language both spirited and nostalgic, evoking a period of our history about which we remain sadly under-informed today. the art section is specially strong in this issue, with, among other pieces, borhanuddin khan jahangir and mansur ali writing on the veteran artist shafiuddin ahmed, poet robiul hosain explicating on artist and cartoonist sisir bhattacharya's much-discussed recent art show, and coverage of the exhibition of the works of new artists at the shilpakala academy (18 may to 6 june) by zahid mustafa. an article on simone de beauvoir however is ordinary and descriptive, as is the somewhat strained writing on fictionalized history by sagar chowdhury, a subject given traction by the overhyped 'hitler diaries.' there is an interview of amitav ghosh which does not reveal anything new to readers of his english books, though that may not hold true of readers of bengali prose. there are three short stories ('reporter' by shaymol mojumdar and 'thaida' by dilara hashim are notable) while for the first time there's also been published a micro-fiction, i.e., a very short, short story. two articles on a couple of bangladeshi writers make for particularly good reading: the lead piece by sarkar abdul mannan on the recently deceased shahidul zahir, and a discussion on hasan azizul haq's collection of short stories bidhobadayr kotha o onannanyo golpo , which apparently was written some time back and has only recently been published. there is a very good review by shamsuzzaman khan of papri rahman's striking novel on jamdani weavers boyan, where the reviewer expertly discusses the dhaka regional dialect in which the novel has been written (pointing out the very unfamiliar words that readers would not know, for example, the word 'tolok' which means tobacco leaf when it is too strong--in fact, anything too overtly spicy, temperamental or powerful is referred to as 'tolok’ ).

scramble for continental shelf rights in the arctic and snail's pace of bangladesh
global climate change and high fuel prices have created a totally different geopolitical realignment and are compelling countries to devise new policies to safeguard the future of their economies. with oil prices hovering around $125 a barrel, oil-exporting countries in one hand are trying to justify the newfound bounty and on the other hand have set a chain reaction of spiralling prices and global uncertainty. such scenarios have already compelled the coastal nations to explore energy resources in the continental shelf (cs) of the arctic region. it is widely believed based on various scientific surveys that about 30 per cent of the world's undiscovered oil and gas lie beneath the arctic region.
transit and the geopolitical realities
bangladesh has once again deflected the indian request for transit at the just concluded foreign secretary level talks. the transit to the seven northeast indian provinces (assam, nagaland, tripura, meghalaya, manipur, mizoram and arunachal pradesh) known as the seven sisters (ss) from the rest of india through bangladesh, to which request to use of the chittagong port for these provinces was added later, has been unresolved since the bangladesh-india trade agreement of 1972 called for use of railways, waterways and road in each other's country for trade.

understanding the soul in an artist...
in recent times, a few books have been published on the leading artists of bangladesh, an initiative which now appears to be a full-pledged trend, deserving appreciation and praise. artists need to be introduced to the art world both through their works and informed discourse about their creative process. comprehensive books on the works of artists thus become their biographies tracing the evolution of their works and the internal and extraneous forces that were brought to bear on them. both the text, the art works, and the contexts, the traditional and contemporary practices within which the artists work, become important. the object, the art works, attains its full meaning through circumstantial explication, the contextual analysis.

frayed sensibilities, angry explosions
the book continues to be a top best seller in italy, and has been in that position in other european countries. this book broke the writer's ten years' silence, until 9/11.the central theme revolves round what is described as islamic terrorism and the incompatibility between the western world and islam. it is to be noted that the comparison is on uneven ground between secularism in the west and religious order in third world countries.
