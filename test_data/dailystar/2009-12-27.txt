drive to free buriganga of sludge is welcome
the authorities will be launching a drive in the first week of january to flush out sludge from the bed of the buriganga. for those who have in recent months been engaged in a movement to free our rivers of all impediments to navigability, it is certainly cheering news. indeed, the very active role played in the drive for a recovery of rivers from encroachment and similar such conditions by the judiciary and the administration is praiseworthy and we believe will be crucial in restoring our rivers to the pristine nature they used to be in until about twenty or so years ago. just how threatened these rivers have become is to be seen not only in the way grabbers have pounced on them but also by the amount of sludge -- polythene, effluents and other elements -- pushed into them by industries situated on the banks of these rivers.
an observation in bad taste
sadly have we observed ruling party leaders of high position occasionally indulging in spewing out comments and innuendoes against their political opponents absolutely unmindful of the insidious effect these can have on the public mind. we are astounded by the horrific remarks of deputy leader of parliament and member, al presidium begum sajeda chowdhury on opposition leader and former prime minister begum khaleda zia for her working beyond 9pm at her party's gulshan office and returning home at 3am, as reported in a prominent bangla daily. this, according to sajeda chowdhury, in a twisted perception, raises a question as to what she does during those hours! such personalised finger-pointing is not only invasive of privacy but also extremely slanderous and in bad taste. a mischievous innuendo, it's absolutely detestable and repugnant to civility and normal sensibilities. this is patently beneath the dignity of her position as deputy leader of parliament and presidium member of al as well as mindlessly uncalibrated as far as the position of the person that the vitriol was targetted at goes -- she happens to be the supreme leader of the opposition. in fact, the al leader's resort to such imputation could only be self-demeaning.
bridging the rural-urban education gap
of the children who took part in the primary school terminal examinations, the three topmost scorers are from the rural areas. in the secondary school certificate (ssc) and higher secondary certificate (hsc) examinations, on the other hand, the students from urban background fare better than their rural counterparts. the reasons for their better performance are obvious. the guardians and teachers of the students lay much importance on this certificate giving public examination. which is why the exams and the top scorers get the highest publicity in the media and attention among the public.
pakistan conundrum
acquisition and use of ethical competence in national and international affairs are being insisted upon now by global actors as the definition of national sovereignty underwent sea changes in the latter part of the 20th century. it is now recognised that political actors must have ethical skill -- i.e. skill necessary to protect freedom and diversity in the modern world -- in dealing with nationals of their own countries, and be accountable to the people.

december 20- 24, 2009
international markets
the dollar surged to a three-month high against a currency basket this week, buoyed by an upbeat tone from the federal reserve, while the euro tumbled on fresh concerns about greece's waning fiscal health. in thin pre-holiday liquidity, the euro slid to its lowest against the dollar since early september. the dollar index, a gauge of its performance against six major currencies, rose to 78.258, its highest since early september. concerns about fiscal troubles in peripheral euro zone countries gathered pace as greece suffered the third downgrade of its credit rating in a week on wednesday. the euro suffering is partly a result of problems and debt issues relating to periphery euro zone countries which could pose a significant strain for the region. view the page metropolitan

environment issues
the water we drink, the air we breathe and the food we eat affect our bodies every day. therefore it is important that these most essential environmental influences do not contain hazardous quantities of substances that may increase the risk of health problems.
ship breaking
the ship breaking industry has grown big at sitakundu coast of sandwip channel. i am connected with the seafarers' union of bangladesh affiliated with the itf, (london) wherefrom i do occasionally get booklets and various publicity materials where sitakundu yard is treated as one of the big ones but shamefully it is declared as the worst and most dangerous one. the shipping & labour welfare ministries have been neglecting the issue. some action was taken by the i.l.o. in the past but that has been stopped for reasons not known to us.
birth of jesus christ
in the sixth month, god sent angel gabriel to nazareth, a town in galilee, to a virgin, the virgin's name was mary. the angel appeared to her and said, "greetings, you who are highly favoured! the lord is with you." mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be. but the angel said to her, "do not be afraid, mary, you have found favour with god. you will be with a child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name jesus. he will be great and will be called the son of the most high. the lord god will give him the throne of his father and he will reign over the house of jacob forever; his kingdom will never end." how will this be," mary asked the angel, "since i am a virgin?" the angel answered, "the holy spirit will come upon you, and the power of the most high will overshadow you. so the holy one to be born and will be called the son of god. "i am the lord's servant," mary answered. "may it be to me as you have said?" then the angel left her. mary said: "my soul glorifies the lord and my spirit rejoices in god my saviour, mary stayed with elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.
women`s fair
women are going ahead with the advance of civilization and the old notion about womenfolk is now fizzling out. in the bygone days, women were considered to do the household works and men used to do all the work outside their homes. but now things are changing, and with the blessing of education people come to realize that a nation cannot go forward keeping half the population backward. now womenfolk are doing all types of works along with men.
ranking of universities
i am writing about the grading system of universities. the real point is that the students of the universities (public and private) are always enthusiastic to know about the present grade of the institutions in which they are studying. others also want to confirm the institutions in which they seek to get admitted. the ugc published a ranking of the private varsities in 2005. but now 2009 is going to end. there are some organisations which are publishing their rankings. but the credibility of these organisations is questionable.
facts andpropaganda!
while the hon. shipping minister, recognising forest plundering as a fact, warns against this criminal activity through harsh punishment, in stark contrast the local mp calls it a "figment of the imagination"! who is right and who is wrong, given your correspondent's news report of 20 december and the vivid photograph published alongside, is anybody's guess!
stop child marriage
the practice of girls marrying at a young age is very common in bangladesh. child marriage can have serious harmful consequences for children. parents choose to marry off their daughters early for a number of reasons. poor families may regard a young girl as an economic burden and her marriage as a necessary survival strategy for her family. in addition, child marriages must be viewed within the context of force and coercion, involving pressure and emotional blackmail, and children that lack the choice or capacity to give their full consent.
internet
internet is the means of communication through computers. it is the largest system of many connected computers around the world. people use internet to communicate with each other. besides, modern business and commerce etc are done though it.
name game
there are some unhealthy competitions practiced among our political parties. the shameless name game is one of those. we saw this culture during the regime of different political parties. this government came to power with the 'slogan' of change. but we do not get any indication of change of their narrow mind. the al-led grand alliance is also not an exception in case of coming out from this 'name game culture'. most probably, this culture is in our blood.
sri lankan women
recent news regarding exploitation of women in sri lankan camps is worrisome. it is regrettably the fallout of the war and the creation of a stream of refugees. the refugees, who are helpless due to lack of basic amenities and support become easy prey to such kinds of exploitation. in such a situation it is the responsibility of the world bodies involved in safeguarding the conditions of the refugees to address the issue.
teachers
more than 50 private universities have been established in our country and some universities have area branches in rajshahi, chittagong, sylhet, khulna and all over the country. it is regrettable that most of the private universities appoint their teachers from public universities. i'm a student of a public university. most of the teachers, not only of our department but also other departments, are working with private universities. some teachers do not take classes regularly.
comments
on 14.12.09, i read in your daily a column on open and distance learning written by dr manzurul islam. that was good writing. i also think that this method of learning should be accepted by the govt and people. i have visited several websites of universities teaching with this method. i think this service responsibility should be distributed to the private organisations. one more public open university and at least one private open university should be allowed to introduce this system as early as possible.
killers of bangabandhu
i don't support only five killers of bangabandhu to be executed. recently the jury gave a verdict in favour of the execution of 12 killers of bangabandhu but only five out of twelve are in custody now.
christmas
christmas is celebrated on december 25 with full enthusiasm by the people around the whole world. basically, christmas or christmas day is a yearly christian holiday commemorating the birth of jesus christ. on top of that, “we wish you a merry christmas" is a sixteenth-century english carol from the west country of england . the derivation of this christmas carol lies in the english ritual where well-to-do people of the society provided christmas treats to the carollers on christmas eve for instance 'figgy puddings' that were incredibly like current day christmas puddings. it is one of the few conventional holiday carols. the song is frequently parodied.
how is that?
two news items published in the daily prothom alo dated 14-12-09 have drawn my attention. one news item is that the shipping minister, one mp of chittagong and chairman of chittagong port authority have gone to india for a visit in connection with discussion/ negotiation with a private agency of india for establishment of specialized hospital in joint venture with chittagong port authority in chittagong port area. the expenditure of the visit will be met from training budget of the port authority for which an amount of taka nine lakh has been withdrawn. for this expenditure the shipping ministry has given approval . in this connection, earlier an eleven- member team of the shipping ministry visited india and discussed the matter with mr. devi sheti, a renowned cardiologist and in exchange only a two-member team from india made a visit to bangladesh.

capital market and small investors
the size of capital market is growing big. the investors are reposing trust in investing in the capital market. more enlistment of public limited companies will help expand the size. but the small investors are still feeling uneasy to invest in the market. hundreds of broker houses are coming forward. many of the broker houses do not offer all the services. the small buyers of shares feel insecure to keep their shares in bo account. because some of the new broker houses have already closed their business without settling everything.
