looking forward to higher cost of living
all indications point to another spiral in the cost of living. such pessimism comes from the fact that one of our largest benefactors, the world bank has suggested the introduction of royalty on natural gas. from what has recently been published in the press of late is that the bangladesh energy regulatory commission (berc) along with petrobangla need to come up with a retail-based pricing mechanism that is built on the basis of costs -- production, transmission and distribution. if we are to go by the report submitted by the international development agency which states "it is proposed that during the following years, the average gas price will be increased every year, by a fixed amount of $0.86 per gj. by 2016, the average price of gas will reach $6.00 gj." all these indicators point to a steady raising of primary fuel prices in both bulk and retail categories over the course of the next few years. needless to say, such price adjustment is unavoidable given ground realities and government energy bodies are busy working out the new pricing regime.

championing the human rights champions
the reaction of the government to the human right watch (hrw) report on the bdr trials is unfortunate. when governments are uncomfortable about their human rights record, the easy way out is to challenge the integrity of the research ("this is a conspiracy to damage the country"), and when that fails, to rubbish the information ("it's all imaginary"). as the former secretary general of amnesty international (ai) i am no stranger to such responses, whether in bangladesh or elsewhere, but in taking that path, governments do more harm than good to their own reputation.

universe in age crisis!
how old is the universe? how long ago did the big bang take place? it may seem like a daunting task to date the birth of something as vast and all-encompassing as the universe. but according to edwin hubble, the indisputable father of modern astronomy, it is not.
what is the higgs boson?
in 1964, the british physicist peter higgs wrote a landmark paper hypothesizing why elementary particles have mass. he predicted the existence of a three-dimensional "field" that permeates space and drags on everything that trudges through it. some particles have more trouble traversing the field than others, and this corresponds to them being heavier. if the field later dubbed the higgs field really exists, then higgs said it must have a particle associated with it: the higgs boson.
usher of modern physics

linking magma to quakes
active volcanoes shake, rattle and roll; scientists can't always be sure whether such activity indicates that molten rock is rising. now, volcanologists have linked earthquake swarms at mount st. helens in washington state with fresh magma pulses. a team led by kate saunders of the university of bristol in england studied more than 300 rock crystals formed during the 1980-1986 eruption of mount st. helens.
cosmic censorship hypothesis
what is cosmic censorship? it is a hypothesis, developed in 1969 by british physicist roger penrose. it states that the universe contains no singularities that are visible to the faraway observer, especially from the vicinity of a black hole. all the familiar singularities are located at the center of a black hole, which are hidden behind the event horizon that makes it invisible. since what goes on in the region of singularity (a point in space-time at which the space-time curvature becomes infinite) is completely hidden from observation, we cannot see the comic events that take place inside that region. and this cosmic “unseeing” is referred to as cosmic censorship hypothesis and the singularities are called naked singularities.

who coined the term big bang?
english astronomer and mathematician sir fred hoyle frs (24 june 1915 20 august 2001) and noted primarily for his contribution to the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis was a strong critic of the big bang. he is responsible for coining the term "big bang" on bbc radio's third programme broadcast at 1830 gmt on 28 march 1949. it is popularly reported that hoyle intended this to be pejorative, but the script from which he read aloud shows that he intended the expression to help his listeners.
