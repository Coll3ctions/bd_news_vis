nawaz sharif returns to be deported
much drama has gone on in pakistan's politics since march this year, when president pervez musharraf attempted to sack the country's chief justice. that move, as we now know, clearly backfired. chief justice iftikhar muhammad chaudhry came roaring back once he was restored to his position by his peers in the supreme court. he then did not waste much time letting pakistanis know how he intended to handle the military ruler who had tried to send him packing. he proved instrumental in accepting a petition from exiled former prime minister nawaz sharif that he be permitted to return home.

china and russia
i am writing with reference to the letter: "sino-russian military exercise," by dr. abdul ruff colachal (august 29).
stranded pakistanis
the question of whether to grant the stranded pakistanis legal rights as citizens of bangladesh should not be viewed from a legal standpoint, but rather on humanitarian grounds. i am glad that the administration is looking into the matter and i am hopeful that they will have some iota of compassion to influence their decision making process.
the divide
i had the opportunity to witness the first ever martial law in pakistan imposed by general ayub khan in october 1958.
patriotism vs. vandalism
i agree with the letter writers on the above mentioned topic( the daily star, august 24).i, too, feel that if there was any real patriotism(not just in words) in us as a nation, we could never condone such rampant violence and destruction of public and private property that took place throughout the country, whatever the provocation might be. admittedly, the incident involving the students and the army personnel at du was regrettable, however that does not justify going on the rampage and burning vehicles and causing damage.
office hours during ramadan
i note that the government of bangladesh has announced that office hours for government and semi-government institutions during the month of ramadan will be from 9:30 am to 3:30 pm with a 15 minute break at 1:00pm for zohr prayers. clearly, this arrangement is meant for muslims, especially those choosing to fast. since there are some 20 million non- muslims in the country, many of whom are employed in government and semi-government offices on equal footing with muslims, one wonders how would they abide by the new hours. the new hours are surely unfair to them. the 15 minute break for zohr prayers is obviously not meant for them and is not long enough as a lunch break. it is not only reasonable that there should be a separate set of rules for these employees, it is also required under the constitutional obligations of the government to treat all citizens equally.
income disparity
the recent survey of world bank has found the east-west income disparity in bangladesh but could not find out the reason for it. in my opinion there are many but following are the few important ones: view the page international

malay bala's oriental expression
delicate visual beauty that builds on smooth wash of colours and subtle lines is the speciality of oriental art. this may be considered a limitation by many, but it has been a staple for a lot of art exponents. artist malay bala is fully into this watercolour-based mode of art. his works are certainly in conformity with this distinct oriental characteristic. portraying human figures is his forte. following academic oriental style of rendering figures, mostly female, malay has composed many canvases. speciality of mala's works remains in his power of imagination, use of vibrant colours and use of new mediums. usually oriental artists use watercolour in wash mediums, however, malay has created a few washes in acrylic. another aspect of his composition is dealing with sub-continental classics.
