pressure on waterway transport
every year the eid-eve rush is a regular occurrence on the river routes. but this time the rundown highways, refusal of the drivers to ply on damaged roads and bus journey taking longer than usual to reach destinations have further increased the pressure on the riverine service. general paucity of buses is another reason for mounting stress on the waterway transports. around 10 to 12 lakh people leave dhaka in the seven days before eid, but this year the number is likely to shoot up increasing the chance of overloading and accidents.

the all-embracing poet
kazi nazrul islam, known as the 'rebel poet', is probably the most uncompromising dissident in bengali literature. many writers and intellectuals, who started with commendable patriotic zeal and revolutionary ideals, often got burned out along the way, either becoming reactionary fanatics or living on the paychecks handed out by governments and financial institutions. but as an individual and also as a public figure, nazrul remained acutely sensitive to suffering of the masses. he gave public speeches and addressed multitudes, edited newspapers, was a performing artiste, and went to jail for the relentlessness with which he protested dictatorships and colonialism. all these make it hard to give an overview of the great poet in a few words.
a bud yet to bloom: ragas created by nazrul
kazi nazrul islam enriched almost all the genres of bangla songs. his compositions are based on the solid foundation of indian classical music.
special programmes on nazrul death anniversary
to mark the 35th death anniversary of kazi nazrul islam, television channels will air special programme throughout the day. highlights:
ascertaining the cultural identity of bengali muslims
nazrul, the national poet of bangladesh, was a harbinger of secularism, liberalism, and interfaith harmony at a time when the sub-continent was mired in religious discord. but that's not all, there was more to nazrul. his spirituality generated what's considered some of the most magnificent musical and lyrical odes to divinity -- both in islamic and hindu traditions. view the page op-ed
imperative of updated police legislation
the time may not be favourable to speak of anything organisationally pertinent to positive police performance. police deficiencies and malfeasances were in the spotlight recently, the public were concerned and the media justifiably angry at multiple indiscretions amounting to criminality of erring lawmen.

spiritualism in tagore's poetry
rabindranath tagore's spiritual outlook and humanism were derived from man, nature and brahma or god. he held the view that the route to spiritual development was from 'body to society, from society to totality and from totality to the spiritual domain'. in this way, the melody of the soul was intertwined with the universal power. but what was required for this inter-mingling was connecting the world of nature with that of human beings. to tagore, the whole human body appeared to be reverberating with the touch of light, air, affection, love, bliss, joy and electricity, as if embedded in a supernatural flute. although he might have been influenced by the romantic movements of the time, the brahma samaj, the bauls, sufism or the vedanta philosophy of upanishads, those views were in some respects tagore's very own. we can very well comprehend how his spirit was liberated by connecting with the universe, the nature and the environment which surrounded him, by looking at the following lines:
the bose connection . . .
sugata bose, author of the recently published his majesty's opponent--- subhas chandra bose and india's struggle against empire, is a professor of history at harvard university. he is also the grand-nephew of netaji subhas chandra bose.
weather talk . . .
i am not a meteorologist by profession, but i pay much attention to what they have to say, be it on radio, television, newspaper, or, now, the internet. however, anyone who has lived in the new england area of the usa (consisting of six states, massachusetts, connecticut, rhode island, maine, vermont and new hampshire) will understand my frustrations with meteorologists because it is hard to understand in relation to weather. they speak in their own language, their forecasts are often wrong, and they frequently land us in trouble! however, i can never be mad at themrather i am fascinated by their craft.

china launches a communications satellite for pakistan
the year 2011 marks 60 years of diplomatic relationship between china and pakistan. this all-weather relationship has largely withstood 'the test of time'. both states recognize the relevance of their cooperation in areas like security, trade and culture. all these years china has mostly followed the 'friend of pakistan policy'. from the indian perspective the focus of their cooperation, which has mostly revolved around security issues, has been a source of anxiety. apart from the question of direct military aid, india must also take note of china's assistance to pakistan in the field of science and technology as well since it has long-term strategic implications. china launched pakistan's first communications satellite (paksat-1r) on august 12, 2011 on a long march-3b carrier rocket. this event demonstrates the deepening in technological cooperation between these two states. for china this was also an event to display the capabilities of its rapidly growing commercial satellite industry.

mixing hindu tea and muslim tea, half and half
subhas chandra bose died of grievous injuries, a consequence of the crash of the small plane he was travelling in, in taipei on 18 august 1945. that was a full two years before the india he loved almost to distraction would achieve freedom from british rule, albeit in bloodied fashion. to this day the question remains: would bose, had his life not been cut short and had he succeeded in returning to india at the head of a triumphant indian national army, have made a difference? would india remain a single entity and would the congress and the muslim league agree to a federal structure guaranteeing equality for all its religious communities? the briefest of responses to these queries would be to suggest that history does not deal with 'ifs' and 'buts'. and yet there is cause for reflection here. judging by the record, by the tumultuous nature of his politics, all encapsulated in his brief life (he died aged forty-eight), bose was without question a secular being absolutely driven by a zeal to bring all indians into a single struggle against colonial domination. as this biography, one as full of substance as it is of pathos, shows, bose was till the end a follower and admirer of deshbandhu chitta ranjan das. when das died at the rather young age of fifty-one in 1925, bose mourned in the loneliness of prison. in an essay written in gaol, bose honoured deshbandhu thus:
