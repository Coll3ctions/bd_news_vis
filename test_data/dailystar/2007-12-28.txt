economy at watershed
the bangladesh bank annual report for fiscal 2006-07 pinpoints stabilising the inflation rate as a major challenge for the policy makers drawing upon the experience of the last year and the outlook for the new year. the increases in wage rates in manufacturing, agriculture, fishery and construction sectors which are slender compared with those of fy06 kept below the rates of consumer price inflation of 7.2 percent in fy07. in other words, real income fell as purchasing power eroded.
ayub quadri's dignified move
the resignation of education and culture adviser ayub quadri in the face of an outcry over the theft of two archaeological artefacts from zia is surely a welcome response to public sentiment. by acknowledging his overall responsibility, as the man at the top of the culture ministry, for the scandal and deciding to send in his resignation to the president, quadri has done a commendable deed. in a country where voluntary resignation from high office is a rare occurrence, indeed where individuals in positions of power and privilege are generally all too ready to pass the buck on to someone else, quadri's decision to quit reinforces our belief in the ability and moral courage of some, if not all, of our influential men to act in the larger interest of the nation without any thought to their own short term welfare. there was dignity in his action.
treading water
some years are transitional and some are transforma-tional. i would like to argue that while 2007 falls into the former category that 2008 will fall into the latter one. but what does it mean to be a transitional year -- especially a year in which so much has transpired in bangladesh. especially for those who have suffered losses during the course of the year -- and there is no shortage of such unfortunates -- nothing is transitional, everything is transformational.
the tube of babel
thanks to television, we can see where the sight doesn't reach. we can see people and places, and then, of course, put faces to names while listening to what they say. and this is how it works. the transmitter broadcasts signals over airwaves. these signals are electrical in nature and are transformed into radio waves, which are then picked up by receivers and processed back to audio and video electric signals that are played on the television set. but somewhere there is a loss of quality in this transformation, because what is released on the screen may not accurately reflect what is captured at the scene. view the page sports

we still have a dream ...
this year's victory day proved to be one of the most significant events of our history. it's so inspiring to see that people from all corners are getting united to realise the demand "trial of war criminals". we made mistakes in the past and do not have to make the same mistakes over again. the very issue has been used for political mileage many times. the usual professional intellectuals are already on the road again. we need to protect our greater interest. let's not forget the " spirit of the liberation war " while we are chasing war criminals. the widow of birsreshtho flt. lt. matiur rahman the other day appealed to implement the “spirit of the liberation war.” do we really understand what is it ?

attestation of mobile form
if an applicant for mobile phone is allowed to get his/her application form attested by a mobile phone owner/subscriber of the same service provider, it will no doubt ease the difficult situation arising in case of re-registration of mobile phones purchased before february, 2006. there are now over 20 million mobile phone owners/subscribers in the country. therefore it would be easier for an applicant to get his/her application form attested by an active mobile phone subscriber who may be a friend or a relation. the government agencies concerned and mobile phone service providers may consider this proposal as another option for the applicants.
rangs bhaban incident
the incident that is hammering my mind for last few days is perhaps bothering many others as well. a number of hard working workers' lives were lost for no fault of theirs. the only reason they were there was for earning from honest labour. they died ignominiously. this death was not for them. yes, i am feeling angry and humiliated as a human being who had to witness such deaths in the capital city of a sovereign country, which was too earned through a bloodbath in the same month of december a few decades ago.
wasting public funds
everyone wishes to greet relatives and friends on special occasions during the year. ideally, one would like to meet the person to greet him. since this is not always possible, we take the help of greeting cards. to meet the demands, greeting cards are manufactured and sold. when you send a card to greet a friend or a relative, you expect it to be reciprocated.
collaborators
the nation is really confused. how are the collaborators of 1971 openly challenging the big parties? it seems some foreign powers are behind them. otherwise, the party, which cannot master more than 2% votes and at the moment there is a strong national demand for trial of the leaders of that party as war criminals, could not take such a defiant stand.

south korean scene
december 19 was not only election day for south korea but it was also the 66th birthday and 37th wedding anniversary of the leading contender--lee myung-bak. although mr. lee has enjoyed top position in the opinion polls (with over 20 points ahead of his main rivals), his campaign seemed to lack the fire and enthusiasm which were usually present in previous south korean presidential elections. but then again he was the favourite to win because his two main rivals --lee hoi-chang and chung dong-young-- failed to grab the public's attention and support. in other words his rivals failed to provide any sort of competition.
ict revolution
thank you very much for your interview-based article on the "high internet tariff" in today's (17/dec/07) star business page. this is a long-standing issue which needs mass awareness and campaign to make internet a commodity for the public and businesses in bangladesh. internet is a global phenomenon in this highly interconnected world. it is in fact a boon to ldcs like us, which can catalyse our developments and exports growth. as the basis president aptly put high internet pricing is seriously holding back our ict exports growth in bangladesh.
war criminals deserve no mercy
it has been exactly 36 years since bangladesh, a small south asian nation of approximately 55,000 square miles of land successfully separated itself from the nation of pakistan - a geopolitical absurdity until 1971. in the process, the people of bangladesh known as bengalees paid a heavy price for liberating their country and becoming a sovereign nation. husbands were killed, wives and daughters were raped and tortured, children were thrown into raging fires, and houses were burned down to ashes by the members of pakistani armed forces. people who were fortunate enough fled to the countryside and ran from one village to another just to stay ahead of pakistani occupation forces. it was their sheer luck and the topographical features of our land that saved many lives, not the mercy of pakistani soldiers. another chunk of bengalees, almost 10 million, took refuge in the neighbouring indian states of west bengal and assam. view the page international

edutainment in “shomoyer kotha”: a welcome change in btv

bangladesh in global warming scenario
today one of the most hotly deliberated topics on earth is the issue of global warming or climate change. increased populations, extreme demand for energy and limited resources have put the global environment under threat. as a result we are getting increasingly aware about the stake of environment we reside in. nowadays the terms greenhouse effect, industrial pollution, air pollution, sustainable development, and biodiversity etc. have become frequently used words.
primates disappearing from tropical forests
primates are considered closest living relatives of mankind. these living relatives -- apes, monkeys, lemurs and other primates -- are becoming rarer from the tropical forest. “reasons for the decline are no mystery: they all relate directly or indirectly to human actions" says a worldwatch institute report. a survey, worked out by 60 experts from 21 countries, cautions that failure to respond to the mounting threats has now been worsened by climate change. on the whole, 114 of the world's 394 primate species are categorised as threatened with disappearance on the international union for conservation of nature (iucn) red list. illegal wildlife trade and commercial plant-meat poaching have been largely blamed for their disappearance.
