it appears that the bangladesh government is going about it the wrong way. india and myanmar are being blamed for submitting their maritime boundary limitations to the un which detract from bangladesh's fair share of the resources. did india or myanmar consult bangladesh and have bangladesh's agreement to delimit such boundary and send it to the un? obviously not. so why is bangladesh so eager to submit its boundary limitations after india and myanmar agree to it?
poor handling
a proverb goes ---- even a mad man can choose the things which are better for him. it seems we are worse than lunatics. yes, i am talking about our maritime boundary in the bay of bengal. we know that we have a vast area in this adjoining sea as per international rules. but our two neighbouring countries india and myanmar want to have a more than fair share of the bay. they have already filed their claims to the un. but we are still doing nothing. some months back, myanmar tried to install some heavy machinery in our territorial waters to extract oil, gas etc. india often sends their naval vessels into our territory.
baby-taxi
it is estimated that two million people in metropolitan dhaka belong to the so called middle-income group. they are facing trouble while commuting in the city. private car is out of their reach. taxi-cab service is inadequate and also too costly for them. when a family likes to join in a marriage ceremony, it needs a low cost vehicle to go to a community centre. when a patient is to be shifted to a hospital, an affordable baby taxi is needed. if a family wants to go to shopping to celebrate a festival, a baby-taxi is required. to appear in a public examination hall, a student needs transport service of a baby-taxi. it is the reality.
admission tests
results of the hsc exams have recently been published. we are happy to see the lovely faces of our next generation who have done so well. but the smiling faces will become gloomy very soon, we easily understand, when the dates of admission tests will be announced in different higher educational institutions. they have to run from post to pillar in a very restless manner during this period. the guardians and applicants take it as normal as they know the reality of our country. but the problem arises when the authorities declare that the admission tests will be held on the same day in different universities.

traffic and rajuk/dcc
the dmp commissioner was right to blame dcc and rajuk for the nagging traffic congestion in the city. if you look around gulistan which is abutted by dcc and rajuk offices, you'll find almost all the markets owned by dcc without any space for even a single car. the building designs must have parking spaces with a specified calculation. but unfortunately all the dcc markets- parking spaces have been converted into underground shops forcing the cars to be parked outside. dcc is realizing the rents from these illegal underground shops and the officials concerned undoubtedly got 'something' into their pockets. we don't have any other watchdogs to oversee this abject violation of laws by the people who are entrusted with the responsibilities to enforce it! the other areas notorious for traffic also have the same problem - markets and buildings without parking spaces. i request the js bodies concerned, as they are the peoples' representatives, to open an enquiry and take appropriate steps, and stern punitive actions against those who are responsible for violating building codes, who do not shoulder the responsibilities to oversee it and who pocketed handsome amounts by allowing these underground shops to operate. view the page international

agonies of indigenous people
indigenous communities, popularly known as adivasi or jumma, are the majority population in the chittagong hill tracts (chts). there are about 49 different indigenous communities living in the plains and hill areas. although they constituted about 98% of the total population in this region in 1941, however, the increase in non-ethnic jumma people in cht had reduced their strength to 51% in 2003. the governments' policies played an important role in the decline. as a consequence, cht suffers from continuous violence among different groups.
