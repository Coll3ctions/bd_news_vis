importance of public participation : japanese experience
for an effective environmental impact assessment (eia) public participation or public consultation is very important. in our country most of the people are still not fully aware of the consequences of bad environment. so their voice remains mute when any project begins in their locality. they only think that it would help them in developing the area and to create employment opportunity. this kind of unawareness makes it easy for the proponent to start a project in the area without considering the environmental issues. on the other hand if in some cases public participation (pp) is involved it does not fully serve the purpose because proper participants (significantly affected) are not properly identified and included, only the positive impacts are discussed and briefing on the project and environmental impacts are hard to understand.

some thoughts on jinnah
a hot political story currently making the headlines in indian newspapers is the expulsion of veteran bjp leader jaswant singh (who had been minister for foreign affairs, finance and defence at various times when the bjp was in power) from the party for his book on jinnah. the rashtriya swayamasevak sangh (rss), the militant hindu fundamentalist organization and the bjp's ideological gatekeeper, is reportedly furious over singh's assertions in the book that jinnah has been 'demonised' in official indian historiography as the sole architect of the partition, and that nehru should be held accountable for the tragedy as well. additional anger was reserved for singh's denigration of sardar patel, the political strongman of bombay during the pre- and post independence era and a congressman whom the rss has appropriated into its iconic line-up. jinnah is turning out to be the nemesis of rightwing politicians of india - bjp's 'jinnah jinx' they're calling it. in 2005, l k advani faced a similar situation, when on a visit to pakistan he let loose a hornet's nest around his head by saying that jinnah was a “great man” and a “secular person.” though that also had not been music to the rss's saffron ears, advani's remarks had not invited the kind of harsh retribution it did on jaswant - advani, after all, had worked hand in glove with the rss for a long time and had led the rath jatra that down the line led to destruction of the babri masjid. therefore, three days after handing in his resignation from the bjp president's post, advani was allowed to limp back into the fold.
