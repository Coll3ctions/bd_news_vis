the devastating blaze
the thursday night's fire in old dhaka with its horizontal and vertical swipes wreaked such havoc on human lives and property that it sent instant shock waves throughout the country and well beyond. as we find ourselves in a national mourning mode and pray for salvation of the departed souls and early recovery and rehabilitation of the victims, our intense anguish must steel us into a resolve to avert recurrence of any such disaster. and, we believe that it is within our means to accomplish the task whatever may be the enormity of the problems. these are basically structural giving rise to built-in vulnerabilities which induced as they are by manmade factors can be redressed through human intervention.

window to the soul
incorporeal or earthbound, integral to conscience or an autonomous existence -- metaphysical arguments over the soul continues. as people are deprived and depraved, do souls get used, abused and exploited? gmb akash, whose photographic vision has been internationally recognised, doesn't go anywhere near these arguments, rather his latest exhibition explores souls in likely and unlikely places -- in flames of a pyre; in a muted, congested, yet lonely home for the elderly and the poorly lit room of a prostitute.

israel has challenged the world
it all depends on how you interpret the "right to live." the israelis believe that they can live only if their state, israel, is not challenged by any power or people in the middle east. others, particularly the palestinians, who were once strongly opposed to the existence of israel, believe that they, however weak militarily, too have the right to live.
acts of self-destruction
first, shutting down the telephone companies, next came closing the tv channel, then came blocking facebook, and now cancellation of the declaration of a newspaper; one after another, the government actions do not testify well for a democratically elected government committed to upholding the right of its citizens, ensuring free flow of information, building digital bangladesh and safeguarding freedom of press.

potato is square
although it looks like either round or oval in shape, but regarding its quality it is square. well, potatoes are good as long as you prepare them in a healthy manner. boiled and baked potatoes are good; but french fries and potato chips are two worst foods of this century. boiled potatoes are a good source of vitamins, minerals and fiber, especially if you eat the skin. in fact, 60 per cent of the potassium contained in the potato lies so close to the skin that it cannot be saved if the potato is peeled.

the cheonan crisis
since the end of the world war ii, the korean peninsula has been known to the world as one of the flash points in the map of international conflicts. the situation in the korean peninsula is again turning into a genuine strategic predicament in the whole region. the recent crisis is centered on the sinking of the cheonan, a south korean naval vessel, on 26 march 2010 causing the deaths of 46 sailors. the sinking of cheonan as such did not generate much heat in the peninsula at the initial stage, because immediately after the incident the south korean government formed an international investigation team officially known as the joint civilian-military investigation group (jig) consisting of experts from the us, the uk, australia, sweden and south korea. it clearly shows the south korean government has taken the appropriate step to identify the real cause behind the incident. the report of the investigators was finally published on 20 may 2010. the report reveals that a north korean submarine's torpedo sank the cheonan on 26 march 2010. as it states, “the evidence points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that the torpedo was fired by a north korean submarine. there is no other plausible explanation.”

return to the age of innocence
childhood for many of us was much more than a coming by experience. it was all too often a long journey into the lands of the imagination. and those lands were peopled by elves, sprites, fairies, ghosts, gnomes and spirits. and we came to know of these supernatural beings from our mothers by and large, from our fathers to a certain extent. there were all the gripping tales of good, innocent men waylaid by ghosts and demons in the shape of wild beasts even as storms lashed the woodlands on the edge of the village. branches were ripped off the huge trees and unnatural laughter was heard as the leaves scattered in the rainstorm. the weary traveller, having lost his way in the storm, was now at the mercy of the ghostly beings now dancing all around him in eerie manner. he stumbled, he slipped; and he found, to his consternation, that his natural ability to scream out in fear had suddenly and inexplicably left him. and so it went on till dawn, when the evil spirits fled; and the exhausted traveller, by then unconscious and prostrate beside a clear village pond, was rescued by peasants on their way to the fields.
broken dreams, shattered illusions
derelict is a poignant tale of a bygone age, of a group of people veritably vanished from bangladesh, told by a person who, one can safely assume upon perusing his biographical note, is familiar with much of the period in bangladesh's history that he sets as the backdrop for his modest-sized novel. derelict, though, is a bit more than modest in its putative appeal to the average reader. the era that is now a much-debated period of south asian history is that of the twilight years of the british raj, and the incipient years of what was properly then east bengal; the dying breed in bangladesh is the anglo-indian community, a misnomer if ever there was one. yet the story revolves a male protagonist, sudhir sebastian rosario, a bengali/native christian, a group that continues to exist, if not exactly flourish, to this day in this country.
an aunt, a niece. . . and the written word
william dalrymple has perhaps rightly commented that if there is anyone born to write the bhutto family's story, it is fatima bhutto. songs of blood and sword, published by penguin and viking, is a sad but unputdownable. fatima is the granddaughter of zulfikar ali bhutto, pakistan's first democratically elected prime minister - ousted by general zia to be imprisoned and finally hanged in 1979. she is also niece to the first female prime minister in the muslim world, benazir bhutto, assassinated in 2007. the writer lost both her uncle and her father in 1985 and 1996 respectively. as i was poring over the pages, i couldn't help remembering yet another book, benazir bhutto's daughter of the east. some of the episodes from the books were like looking at the same picture from different angles.
