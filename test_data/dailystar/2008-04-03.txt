dual citizenship
i wholeheartedly welcome the judicious decision of the chief adviser of the caretaker government of bangladesh to amend the existing legal framework on dual citizenship of bangladeshi britons, so that they no longer have to forfeit bangladeshi citizenship as soon as they become british citizens, unless they want to relinquish it voluntarily. not having to reapply for retaining the bangladeshi citizenship will, doubtless, be a privilege for the first generation bangladeshi britons to avert a bureaucratic quagmire replete with requirements, that oftentimes discourage them from venturing beyond a “no visa-required” (nvr) seal duly stamped on their host country passport before visiting the sending country as veritable outsiders looking in. it may, very well, generate a sense of entitlement among the post-immigrant generation in the bangladeshi diaspora and facilitate them to develop a “transnational social field” incorporating their country of origin. i will plead that this privilege be extended to the bangladeshi-americans as well. view the page international
