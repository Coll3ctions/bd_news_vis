bangladesh's women ahead of others
the good news about bangladesh's women is that in terms of status and gender equality they are quite ahead of women in such south asian nations as india (except for kerala) and pakistan. the bad news is that when it comes to a question of access to reproductive health services, employment and decision-making, they yet have a pretty long way to go. perhaps these are truths we have known for quite a while. what a report of the world bank has now done is inform us officially of the conditions in which bangladesh's women find themselves today. implicitly, the report is also a broad hint of what must be done further to have the other half of our society take full and absolute part in any and all development related activities in the country.

an alternative to foreign loans
the country still depends on foreign loans given by the world bank, adb and also other countries of the world for financing its annual development plans and other infrastructural projects. every year shortages of internal revenue arise while implementing the annual development plans in the national budget and to meet the shortages the country has to resort to foreign loans or loans from internal banking system. apparently the foreign loans appear to be cheap with interest rates ranging from 2 percent to 6 percent per annum, but at the end of the day total costs rise from 20 percent to 30 percent per annum . how it happens is described below: view the page sports

it flourishes in freedom
two to three hundred years back it was often suggested that the sum of human knowledge would double every half a century. these days people may argue whether the doubling time of knowledge is eight or ten years. presently we are witnessing an overwhelming predominance of things that are new over those that are old. we are witnessing colossal changes, cognitive, technical and practical ones in our day-to-day lives. the enormity and rapidity of these changes mean that we suffer from a kind of desiccation. presently, we find it extremely difficult to keep in mind what happened in the past and unite all our fond memories with our present commitments. because of these problems of adjustment we have to endure the imbalance and uncertainties that prevail in society nowadays, king canute was wrongly counseled by his advisers and sycophants. the roaring sea did not tarry a while. but no matter how painful and insistent the problem of adjustment is we must not only endure the imbalance, we must vow that in the end we shall overcome it.

governance for the poor
good governance is not just about government, it is also about political parties, parliament, the judiciary, the media and civil society. it is about how citizens, leaders and public institutions relate each other in order to make change happen. election and democracy are an important part of the equation, but equally important is the way government goes about the business of governing. good governance requires three things: (i) state capability, (ii) responsiveness, and (iii) accountability. this means citizens, civil society and government need to work together to build effective state and provide better governance to reduce poverty.
class routine must not be an impediment
teaching quality improvement in secondary education project (tqi-sep) under the auspices of ministry of education is the biggest project so far taken for the development of secondary education in bangladesh. the goal of the project is to increase the quality of education of the said level by improving the quality of teaching. one of the steps the project has taken to achieve the objectives is to introduce participatory mode of teaching instead of traditional teacher-centred approach. in the traditional teacher-dominating approach, teachers are quite totalitarian. learners are usually inactive and sometimes they are bullied to remain passive. as a result, classrooms, become joyless, tedious, monotonous, boring for both the sides, especially for learners. with a view to minimising this sort of limitations and making the classrooms joyful, interactive, and democratic, learner-friendly, learner-centred, tqi-sep is going to initiate participatory approaches at the secondary level. view the page environment
climate change and development risk: local perspective
climate change is already happening. glaciers are melting, sea levels have risen, and cyclones, tornados, floods and droughts are becoming more frequent as well as intense. with rising carbon emission levels, climate change is likely to get worse before it gets better. the anticipated climate change impacts in bangladesh would be manifested in two ways in two contrasting regions such as (i) the southern part towards the sea will experience drainage congestion due to higher water and river bed levels, salinization of soil and water resources due to lower river flows, sea level rise and more intense disasters including cyclone and storm surges with higher risks because of higher water and (ii) the other part of the country in the north-western region will be subject to scarcity of water leading to drought condition and aridity with lesser rainfall and higher temperature.. tropical cyclones, tornado and nor'western which strike the country periodically and annually and create untold misery and loss of life, property and ecosystems, are likely to increase in frequency and intensity under climate change. against this adverse climate change scenario the people would be striving for their livelihood which has already fallen into serious vulnerable category.

an internet scam
a news item on hoax e-mails prompted me to write this piece. the daily star on 10 october 2007 reported that the british high commission was warning people against being duped by internet scams which claim to offer large financial sums. the need of such a warning was now apparent since many people had started receiving such unsolicited e-mails, purportedly from uk companies. but who warns when those come from companies of other countries! moreover, the fact is such e-mails are the product of the computer age, and have been in practice for quite some time. this story is about one such email scam.

a saarc poetry festival
bharathi devi's mail smelt of a complaint. i hadn't written, hadn't called, and hadn't done anything since i got back from bhubaneswar. bharathi, the nightingale from karnataka, was a schoolteacher and a poet who believed in revisions. her poem 'taimur' had gone through at least ten rounds of revision while most would be attempting to write the next poem and paint the next page. she also had a voice that demanded the attention of even the most vocal bunch of sixty-four poets, thirty-four of whom were from orissa. bharathi was indeed a bridge. and with her help, i ended up without having to suffer the severe bouts of fibromyalgia - painful muscle-tightening of the back - that long distance travel otherwise triggers off in me. what cures it is simple rest. that has been difficult all my life except this one time i'm writing about now, where no discomfort was experienced despite daily bus travels for over five hours to distant places, eating out of “kolapata” platters, drinking tea in plastic cups, and having to use public toilets. it also speaks volumes about the therapeutic powers of poetry!

collective security and the use of force
the iraq war has put the usefulness of the un in a very difficult spot since its inception in 1945. after the iraq war was launched by the us-led forces in march 2003, many questioned the need for a new institutional framework and vision that could marry prudent anticipatory self-defence against immediate (not perceived) threat to states.
a free and fair election for nothing
since its inception 37 years back, bangladesh has a very good track record of conducting free and fair election for the most part. all of these elections were under microscopic watch of the european community, other international election monitoring agencies and human rights organizations. and it is they who ratify whether elections conducted were free and fair or not. the losing party might have stated some negative remarks but that did not resonate further from any other reckonable corner. now the question is, what we practically achieved from all those well conducted free and fair elections? could the people of this country fulfill their long-cherished aspirations? could we institutionalize our political or ethical values? some might say it is the opposite. they will point at the institutionalization of corruption at all levels under the cover of democratic practice.

people called the fort at mandalay in burma, the glass palace … a city in itself…' the story of the last days of independence of the country that became a part of the british empire in 1885.
for women, the long road to equality
the tragic fact of life is that women, in most parts of the world, are second-class citizens and they still face inequality in all spheres of life. they are discriminated against at birth, subordinated and exploited throughout their life despite their valuable and noteworthy contributions to society and national development process, and end their life as being dependent on their sons. this fact has been eloquently noted by the author when she writes that 'the index ranking of 151 countries on gender inequality in addressing poverty, education, basic health, employment, violence, political participation' contained in various human development reports prepared by the united nations development programme between 1995 and 2003. these reports show that no country treats its women population as equally as it does its men.
lives in turbulence
it's not often that a work of literary fiction successfully crosses the divide into the popular mainstream, but with the publication of his second novel, a thousand splendid suns, author khaled hosseini has achieved precisely that for the second time running. following the spectacular success of his debut the kite runner in 2003 -- interestingly, the first novel published in english by an afghan author -- a thousand splendid suns is a heart-wrenching tale of endurance, betrayal and an indestructible friendship set in the backdrop of over four decades of the social and political landscape of afghanistan. deriving its title from a poem about kabul by a seventeenth-century persian, the story chronicles the lives of two women whose destinies become inseparably entwined through a series of personal and, subsequently, common misfortunes.
