crippling power cuts
it seems that we will not be able to get out the problem of power shortage in the short-term. in some parts of the capital last friday, the residents had to suffer power outages as many as four times lasting several hours, without the people being told what was to befall them, in advance. we have never had enough of electricity, and, in spite of the fact that the problem is recurring year in and year out, the government seems not to take timely measures to offset the impact.
international women's day
we observe today international women's day. the observance is not a run of the mill affair, indeed cannot be, for there are the very critical issues that have in recent years arisen about the position and status of women across the globe. given the particular context in which women pursue life here in bangladesh, it can be said with a fair degree of assurance that if women have taken forward strides they have also come across impediments that need to be done away with. in other words, women's progress here has been remarkable; but at the same time there are some glaring gaps that need to be filled. take, for instance, the fact that as many as 59 per cent of bangladesh's women are employed in various ways in the agricultural sector. but that is no suggestion that their contributions are recognised for what they are. that is when the matter of discrimination comes in.
from mutiny to madness
george patton, an american general who fought in both world wars, explained that the object of war was not to die for one's country but to make the enemy die for his. the soldiers who died and the soldiers who killed in the mutiny of 25th february at pilkhana weren't mutual enemies. for god's sake, neither did they come from two different countries. yet one side so fiercely slaughtered the other, its depravity has left us gasping in pain.
a general, a friend

lawachhara forests
this has reference to a news report published in your daily of 23rd. feb, 2009(page 16, column 1). the report tells us that seismic survey conducted for gas exploration did not adversely affect the biodiversity of lawachhara forests. this should be heartening for us all. however, the iucn survey on biodiversity is based mainly on hoolock gibbons. nothing specific has been said about the “other species”. what are these “other species” and how was it determined that they have not fled from the disturbed area? any student of biodiversity will tell you that surveys based on one or a few species is not reliable. there are a few reports on avifauna of this forest, but iucn survey apparently did not take these into account. it is the smaller animals like squirrels, wild cats, mongoose etc. that are more likely to have been affected. besides the lawachhara forest is home to a number of rare species of butterflies and odonates(dragonflies and damselflies). i wonder why an organisation like iucn did not include these in their survey. on the whole iucn report may pacify general public but is certainly not acceptable.
soil issue
at present, the standard om content of bangladesh soils is less than 1%, ranging between 0.05 and 0.9% in most cases. the land area is gradually declining because of population growth, industrialisation and other infrastructure development. however, agriculture plays a key role in over all financial growth of the country, more than 70% of the population depend on agriculture. in order to feed the huge population a green revolution was designed in the 1960s and priority was given to producing more food in terms of grain through strengthening of land usage. it has created a tremendous pressure on limited land resources. new crop variety was introduced as well as chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and irrigation in the name of modernization. as a result instant objectives of more grain production have been achieved. for a shorter period bangladesh achieved near self sufficiency in food.
education or discrimination?
much has been written on the topic of the three-tier education system of our country . broadly speaking, there are three types of education systems :the mainstream bangla medium education for the middle class people, the madrassa education for the poor and the english medium schooling for the privileged people. it is said that this division in education adds to the rich- poor gap and sustains social inequality.
we mourn
we are perplexed, we are shocked. brutal killing that has occurred in the bdr headquarters is inhuman. we are speechless. due to the updated transmission of the electronic media about what was happening at the bdr headquarters, we have seen a sad drama which is unbearable. it is a black chapter in the history of bangladesh. many have said that it was a mutiny; many other pointed it as a deep conspiracy. whatever the cause is, it is true that we have lost so many talented and skilled defence officials. we have to think about it deeply. it cannot be a mutiny, it was a pre-planned killing. there should be a valid reason for a mutiny. but i don't think that killing of over 75 high ranking talented army officers, without even giving them the chance to know what their fault was, is an indication of mutiny. more or less, many bangladeshi families have their relatives in the army. we feel proud when we say that we have our relatives who are army officers. but now we are finding the dead bodies of those talented high ranking defence officers in sewage drains! it is not a normal incident. we are finding their dead bodies from mass graves! it is not a normal incident. the freedom of this country is once again questioned by this incident. we cannot tolerate such a massacre within an independent country. it seems that it was a pre-planned conspiracy to destroy our army and the bdr together.

drug addiction is a great menace. it is more than a national problem.
massacre at pilkhana
how can we call ourselves a civilized nation when 100 people are herded together, shot and their bodies burned.
home minister
the pm gambled in the selection of her cabinet colleagues. she lost the first game in pilkhana massacre. the carnage not only put the capability of the government in question, rather it has shaken its stability after such robust mandate in the polls.
rohingyas
my attention is drawn to a report entitled “rohingyas to be taken back if they claim to be bengalis,” a report based on the announcement by myanmar authorities at the recently held asean summit (the daily star, 01 march 2009).
irreparable loss
the mutiny is over, having a great span of time, 33-hours. the cruelty and atrocity of the mutiny is beyond description. how human beings, how civilized people living in this civilized world could be so cruel, so inhuman, so brutal, so beastly and so barbaric?
an opportunity for us
cricket is getting momentum in bangladesh. may be we had been in progress though we have no major win in test cricket over the big names. we had a close finish on several occasions. in odi, two major wins over new zealand and sri lanka earned international reputation and our players sakib and mortuza were included in the top ten. sakib made history.
pogrom, not mutiny
initially we had believed that bdr jawans were grossly discriminated against and out of pent-up frustrations they staged a mutiny. but with days passing and mass graves being dug out, it is now crystal clear that a conspiracy was hatched to destroy the whole chain of command not only in the bdr, but also in other disciplined forces. only officers and their families have been victims in this barbarous pogrom perpetuated by a few dozens of bdr soldiers.
reorganise bdr
the heinous crime of killing, looting, burning , torture and rape perpetrated by some human faced devils at pilkhana, dhaka on 25 and 26 of february 2009 has put not only the name of bdr to shame but also the whole nation.
cricket and terrorism
one of the most popular games in the world, especially in this subcontinent, is now the target of terrorists in pakistan. we do not know when it is going to end. however, it is very logical to think that the ensuing world cup matches in the subcontinent are going to be affected. we want to see an early end to the crisis and want that the terrorists are wiped out. the sports arena must be kept safe and free from the fundamentalists and terrorist forces.
save our language
bengali is one of the most used languages in the world. bengali is the only language for which people sacrificed their lives. for this language, we have today the "international mother language day".
national unity
a general in a talk show stated that our security forces can be infiltrated easily and such infiltrators are untraceable. in the recent mutiny of the bdr outside infiltrators surely were there, according to him. he also said they could not be identified, as if they simply vanished into thin air. now, it is a fearsome claim implying that our security forces lack security themselves and we have no remedy for that. he has not answered how he decided that there were invisible infiltrators since he could not find any. how does he know if the story was not concocted? in these talk shows, we see bashing of one group by another and vice versa. this is not the time for division, confrontation and reaping political benefits. we should stand united as a nation now more than ever. mir mahboob ali fiction writer and freelanceconsultant former senior executive the bangladesh observer
