relativity and aging
for decades it's been known in the scientific communities that time passes faster at higher elevations. and this inquisitive aspect of dr. albert einstein's theories of relativity (which by-the-way, single handedly altered the notion that time runs at the same rate for everyone, everywhere in the universe) has been previously proven by comparing clocks on the earth's surface and a high-flying rocket back in 1976, by the smithsonian astrophysical observatory. and again, physicists from the national institute of standards and technology (nist) of usa have measured this very effect at a more down-to-earth scale of 33 centimeters or about 1 foot very recently! and the result of the experiment was obvious, the further away is a person from the surface of earth, the faster the time passes for her/him on a human scale. to put it more simply, a person ages faster even when she/he stands a couple of steps higher from our planetary surface! published in the sept.24th issue of science, scientists from nist, however, explain that the difference (given that distance) is much too small for humans to perceive directly. and the research have found out that a height of that particular difference (one foot or 33 centimeters) actually resulted in a time variance of roughly a billionth of a second per year. another aspect of the relativity that was observed by the nist researchers was time also passes more slowly when one moves faster.

saturn in infrared light
the familiar ringed planet resembles a round glowing ember in this infrared-light image. infrared light is a low-energy form of light invisible to the unaided eye. it is often the only light that cool objects (such as planets) emit themselves, rather than simply reflecting off the sun. thus the "glowing" appearance of saturn's orb in the image, which shows the giant gaseous planet in three "bands," or energy levels, of infrared. the photo is posted on nasa's astronomy picture of the day website for sept. 27.
