visit by neighbouring indian cms
a special feature of the indian prime minister manmohan singh's just-concluded visit to bangladesh was the presence of chief ministers from four northeastern states of india in dhaka. it is for the first time that such a good number of influential indian politicians at the state level travelled to bangladesh. indeed, as far as we can recall, visits by politicians from india's north-east have been conspicuous by their non-happening. that only doubles our appreciation of the goodwill gesture the four chief ministers made to us. view the page sports
