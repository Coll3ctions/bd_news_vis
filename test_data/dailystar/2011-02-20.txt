tigers go down fighting
the euphoria about the world cup opener is gone, and all that bangladesh are left with is the disappointment of an 87-run loss against the might of india. one aspect of yesterday's game that will haunt the home team and its supporters for some time to come is the lapse in judgement in sending india in to bat after winning the toss. except some flashes with the bat, nothing went right for shakib al hasan's men in the highly anticipated opening match of the icc cricket world cup against favourites india at the sher-e-bangla national stadium in mirpur.

demand for bangla got louder after the killing
following the shootings of february 21, 1952, it became clear that the whole of east bengal and indeed the entirety of pakistan were numbed by the tragedy. but the most important lesson emerging from the incidents of the day was that the movement for bangla as the language of the state had assumed a much bigger dimension than could earlier be conceived of by politicians in the corridors of power. after february 21, events moved with remarkable speed. on april 26, 1952, as abul maal abdul muhith reports in his state language movement in east bengal 1947-1956, a non-communal organisation going by the name of east pakistan students' union was established. alongside the emergence of the organisation came the fact of leading progressive bangali thinkers getting together sometime in the middle of the year to form the pakistan shahitya parishad.

rising tide of popular demands

the expected has happened
we would like to dwell a little on country bangladesh and team bangladesh to make our first point. the country bangladesh came through with éclat and flying colours for the magnificent opening of the world cup. then followed the preparations for the opening encounter between india and bangladesh which impeccably marked the beginning of the world cup cricket, 2011. on the match day, traffic and entry into the stadium were managed well with due diligence as inside of the stadium wore a colourful, impressive look. view the page sports
calling right, deciding wrong
there are many theories about the toss but cricket teams usually have two sets of plans to counter its aura. the captain of the weaker side would ideally like to attack with his strength and use that momentum to bring home the win. through cricket history, the enigma of the toss has on very few occasions been redundant. some captains even want to lose the damn thing just to avoid the responsibility.
sehwag the plunderer
virender sehwag's bat laughed off the big occasion, expectations, threat of an upset and history. the right-hander's 140-ball 175 was testament to his fondness to prove everyone wrong and play according to his own formbook. he made sure he took his revenge on the tigers after the port-of-spain defeat haunted him for the last four years.

times (of india) out of tune
the opening ceremonies that precede major sporting events, by their very nature, are usually quite drab affairs. sport is an arena for thrill underpinned by suspense, the ebb and flow of emotions you are no longer in control of. au contraire, these lavish opening ceremonies only provide an opportunity for some pomp and pageantry, at best a coming-out party, at worst unnecessary.

g20 can't control commodities, but rates would
nicolas sarkozy thinks he has radical ideas for the g20 to address volatile commodity prices, stopping just short of guillotining traders. a world burdened by inflation in oil, other commodities and food may share his frustration. the president hopes the french and other europeans will, too. but dividing the world's commodity trades between the “commercial” and the “speculative” ones isn't easy. this means g20 finance ministers may realise little in their discussion on the matter -- even though sarkozy is right that speculation in commodities is part of the price problem.

knowledge corner
birth of a test playing nation: bangladesh
a new era began for bangladesh cricket on 10 november 2000 when the national team played their first test match against india at bangabandhu national stadium, dhaka. bangladesh became the 10th member of the elite family of test playing nations in the world. being a test playing nation was not as easy as it was thought to be. bangladesh's cricketers had to face many obstacles on their way to achieving test status. bangladesh's first official foray into international cricket came at the 1979 icc trophy in england, leaving the tournament with 2 wins and 2 defeats. seven years later, on 31 march 1986, bangladesh played in its first odi match against pakistan in the 1986 asia cup. although football was the most popular game here for a long time, cricket gained momentum and soon surpassed football, especially after bangladesh won the icc trophy in malaysia in 1997. the year 1999 was a historic year for bangladesh as it played its first world cup in england. bangladesh created an enormous upset by beating pakistan by 62 runs during the 1999 cricket world cup in the group match at northampton. bangladesh managed 223/9 from 50 overs; in reply pakistan could only manage 161 due to a few run-outs by wicketkeeper khaled mashud and some tight bowling by khaled mahmud, who took 3/31 from 10 overs. he was later judged man of the match. bangladesh also beat scotland in that tournament, although they did not qualify for the super six round due to defeats in three of their five matches. however, the win over pakistan, who went on to become eventual runners-up to australia in that world cup, gave bangladesh a head start in their quest to become a test playing country.

ship breaking sector's future
as reported in your front page on 30th. january, hon. state minister for environment & forest has logically stated that steel importers will be most benefited by harming the ship breaking sector. interested parties are therefore inciting the environment groups to get after this sector which supplies most of the raw materials for steel rolling industry and steel melting. ship breaking also employs a sizable number of people, providing them a livelihood.

a brilliant suggestion!
the suggestion of readers of your newspaper in recognising people like sir frank peters for his noble and worthwhile contribution to bangladesh and bestowing upon him and other foreigners the honorary title of 'goodwill ambassador' and 'friend of bangladesh' is brilliant! in almost 40 years of successive governments, we have not said 'thanks' to anyone for their good deeds or kind contributions. hopefully, this will break the cycle, but i doubt it. if we cannot honour and demonstrate our gratitude to the likes of musa ibrahim who risked his life and limb scaling mount everest and escalated bangladesh into world news in the most positive way imaginable, i would not be holding my breath awaiting any form of thanks if i were a foreigner.
honouring our language
every year 21st february is celebrated in bangladesh remembering the supreme sacrifices of the language heroes of this country. today our state language is bangla. but could we establish bangla as a mode of communication in all spheres of life? why can't we use bangla in all govt. ministries? bangla is spoken by around 30 million people in the globe. 21st february has been recognised as the international mother language day. but as bangalee, we don't show due respect to our mother language.
we are in trouble
awami league has come to power with a landslide victory but so far it could do very little according to its election pledges. prices of essentials are sky rocketing day by day. unemployment is a big issue. electricity and gas crises have become acute. our government should solve electricity crisis immediately for industrial and agricultural development. breaking the syndicate is essential to halt the spiralling prices of the essentials.
violence against women
harassing girls or women has become a common matter nowadays which can be regarded as one of the worst social diseases of the country. this leads many girls to take a very hard decision of not going outside their home and ultimately force them to drop out from schools and colleges and sometimes to migrate to other places along with their families. another big concern is that the girls harassed outside even tend to kill themselves. though many educational and non-governmental organisations stood by those victim families expressing their concern, protested by forming human chains to make some differences, but these do not seem to be enough to wipe out this social disease.
hena's death
living abroad we dearly love our country and people. but i feel that people back there have lost their hearts. hena, the 14-year-old girl, who according to the news report was raped by her cousin and was punished to death next day for being raped!! i am sure the fatwabaj definitely had some interest in the matter, as they also lessened the punishment of the rapist who should only be punished for the heinous act. i do not know what is happening in my country. i am frustrated and saddened.
our mps
our parliament sessions are short and the debates far shorter. our elected representatives are not passionate men and women, driven to politics by a determination to leave their mark on the world, or at least on those who oppose them.
the usual channels
i wonder if, on her recent visit to the uk, the honourable prime minister enquired about an odd expression, used in the mother of parliaments. as a student of constitutional history, it used to puzzle me - 'the usual channels'. the explanation was given to me eventually, and, coming across it recently, i was struck by its continuing relevance.
let's get it right!
with the onset of the cricket world cup season 2011, the sports channels are all abuzz with talk shows and flashbacks to encapsulate the spirit of the occasion. so, yesterday i was watching the semi-final of icc world cup 2003 between australia and sri lanka on neo cricket. australia was batting first. adam gilchrist and matthew hayden were hitting all over the park until a ball went up and was caught in the slips. the bowler went up with a “howzzat” and so did the other fielders. however, the umpire remained unfazed and signalled a 'not out' for gilchrist. and then to the utter amazement of the commentators, the opposition team, his own teammates and the whole audience present in the stadium, adam gilchrist walked out of the crease and started his way back to the pavilion. the case was such that even technology could not have detected that gilchrist was out and he would have easily got a 'benefit of doubt.” but gilchrist showed the courage to stick to what is right in the face of all kinds of temptations. we all might as well take a note of this on the backdrop of the nation striding through rampant corruption prevailing literally everywhere possible. view the page international
