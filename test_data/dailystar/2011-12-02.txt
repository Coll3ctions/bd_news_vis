creating more city corporations
we think that the issue in question should be judged from a number of points of view such as:
tipaimukh issue
we have 57 international rivers of which 53 flow through india and bangladesh. countries having international rivers need to follow the international laws on sharing the river water.
low birth weight and autism
a study conducted by the us researchers reveals that babies born weighing less than 1.8kg could be more prone to developing autism than children born with normal weight. it is a very bad news for us because the number of underweight children in bangladesh is very high. i have learnt from a report published in this paper that bangladesh's progress in reducing prevalence of underweight children has become static at about 40 percent since 2000. doctors say that low birth weight brings many complications to the babies. we know that maternal malnutrition is the main cause of low birth weight of the baby and that malnutrition develops due to lack of diversified and animal protein-riched food intake.
two dictators!
as the world watches the unfolding of arab spring in the middle east and west africa, i cannot stop thinking what would happen if bangladesh's youth occupy shapla chattor and demand the end of the misrule by the two parties. none of the two major political parties goes through leadership change; probably it is also true for the marginal parties.
solution looking for a problem!
i have long thought that one would consider recruitment only if there aren't enough qualified personnel to discharge the duties in one's company. but recently, i've noticed that the government appoints first and then decides on what functions the new ministers may discharge. i think that the appointment was a priority, and their function secondary in consideration.
manufacturing wars
president is authorised to use military force against those who perpetrated the 9/11 attack and those countries that harboured those individuals. well, more than a decade later, there was an article in the washington post where the us officials were anonymously saying that al qaeda, the group that perpetrated the 9/11 attack, according to the government, was now dead.
why support pakistan team?
i went to watch the bangladesh-pakistan t-20 match at mirpur stadium on 29th november. as usual, the spectators were inspiring the bd team from the gallery by waving flags, showing posters of shakib and tamim, displaying placards with inspiring words and cheering when the pakistan wickets were falling down. but i noticed that a few bangladeshis were supporting the pakistan team! they were waving pakistani flags, drawing pakistani flags on their cheeks and cheering at their success.
we need a change
the political scenario of our country is very pathetic. after 40 years of our so-called independence, we still have to worry about our education sector. when will our people become literate? our fate or future is beholden to the two political families. the people are bound to cast their votes for the two parties. this situation must change.
congratulations to the ncc mayor
in 2007 i visited the office of narayanganj municipality regarding lged-ugiip implementation. i saw in the face of selina hayat ivy, glowing with strong commitment and determination. i hope, as the first city mayor, she would seize the opportunity in a better way in order to bring back the old glories of narayanganj. the local citizens should not also miss the opportunity to extend their cooperation to get the best out of her.
give logical vision to dcc split
the government has been insisting on how the dcc split is aimed at catering to the needs of rapidly expanding dhaka city. the city corporations just have to scale up their operations and efficiency to handle the growing population everywhere in bangladesh. global experiences suggest that mushrooming of regulatory/administrative units lead to only higher corruption, not efficiency. the government really needs to communicate a logical strategic vision for the split.

bangladesh in cpi 2011: is improvement sustainable?
the corruption perceptions index (cpi) 2011 was released by transparency international yesterday. in a scale of 0-10, bangladesh scored 2.7, which is 0.3 higher than in 2010, and occupied 120th place among 183 countries compared to 134th among 178 countries in 2010. in terms of ranking from below bangladesh is placed at number 13, one step higher than last year. in the same position as bangladesh are equador, ethiopia, guatemala, iran, kazakhstan, mongolia, mozambique and solomon islands.
what's in a name, if the voice is fresh?
at the outset, i am tempted to recall a swami vivekananda anecdote as follows: a brick was seen on a road and as walkers passed it by, none cared to even look at it, let alone remove it for pedestrian convenience. but when a man stumbled over it hurting himself, people took notice of the incident bending over him in sympathy. the obstacle was removed by a collective decision underlining the virtue of organisation in human affairs. that is the essence of the story; in detail though, i may stand corrected.
power of cities and division of dhaka
in 1800, only 3% of the world's inhabitants lived in urban areas. in 2008, the world's population was evenly split between urban and rural areas. it is argued that the 21st century will not be ruled by superpower america or emerging power like china, but by the city. this, according to parag khanna, a geo-political expert, is largely due to time, technology and population growth that have accelerated the advent of this urbanised era.

freedom fighter zinnat ali could never have thought of such a tragic end to his life. he was a senior school teacher and a modest person according to the people who knew him at barisal. most notably, he was a freedom fighter who fought bravely for the liberation of the country. but that reputation did not help him from not being murdered. what was his fault? he stood against and protested the stalking of his teenage daughter. but stalker rupam dey anik and his friends did not like this act of bravery and stabbed him to death. he even phoned zinnat ali's daughter to be sure whether her father had died or not after the incident.
