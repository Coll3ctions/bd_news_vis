tib impeding war crimes trial?
it is both surprising and deeply disturbing to note that of late the government has not been taking criticism in the spirit it should. besides, even when significant public opinion surveys point to the many things which are going wrong in the country, the authorities have quickly adopted a posture that is truly disappointing for the nation. last week, the government in general and the police administration in particular came down heavily on transparency international bangladesh over its findings that the police in the country conveyed an extremely corrupt image before the public. where introspection and careful analysis of the tib report was called for, the government simply went for a knee-jerk response and questioned the modalities upon which the report had been prepared. it left broad sections of society wondering why the government was displaying such thin skin when it came to a revelation of some harsh truths.

weekly currency roundup
dec 19- 23, 2010
international markets:
this week marked another volatile week for currencies. after having hit all time lows against the swiss franc, the euro recovered on wednesday, boosted by a news report that china was ready to buy significant amounts of portuguese sovereign debt. the jornal de negocios daily reported china is looking to buy between 4 billion euros ($5.26 billion) and 5 billion euros of portuguese sovereign debt to help the country ward off pressure in debt markets, though it gave no details of its sources. china's central bank declined to comment on the report which said the deal reached between the two governments will lead to china buying portuguese debt in auctions or in the secondary markets during the first quarter of 2011. despite the bounce, investors are nervous about the single currency's prospects given the euro zone's debt problems. latest blows this week to the 16-member club's struggling, heavily-indebted economies have came from moody's, which warned it might cut portugal's rating, and fitch, which said the same about greece. view the page metropolitan

tagore classics, european notes
rabindranath tagore and alain daniélou met in 1932 at shantiniketan and formed a deep mutual understanding and cultural affinity. daniélou was a french artist and scholar, with an intense interest in everything indian. he learned the languages, as well as indian art, literature and most of all, the hindustani classical music tradition. daniélou found in tagore an inspiration. and in him, the nobel laureate poet found a perceptive interpreter.

chhayanaut’s grand classical music fest wraps up
tabla player swarup hossain cannot fail to stun. it is not only a matter of the astonishing agility of his fingers. nor only is it his ability to conceive an orchestral range of sonorities when striking what seems to be nothing more than a stretched skin. there is grandeur in the architecture of his sound creations, and an intense spirituality to a performance that concentrates attention and refreshes the soul.

playing snakes and ladders with india
indian prime minister dr. manmohan singh is expected to visit bangladesh early next year. our foreign office (and curiously our prime minister's office) is working out the dates and other details with the south block in delhi. there is anticipation in dhaka that this visit could be seminal and put our bilateral relationship on a new trajectory. many think that the last visit of our hon'ble prime minister sheikh hasina to delhi had broken new ground. in that context, the visit to dhaka by the indian prime minister will allow the growing relationship to now take hold.
the radialogue wound
new words are an annual media byproduct without a balance sheet. the profit is not immediately visible, and loss not worth the count. the new york times has produced a thirty-plus list that seems more obligatory than essential. most words show the strains of artifice. fortunately, terms like "sofalize" (socialising from home, through the net) will die a natural death after their fifteen seconds of fame. the hideous "mansplainer" just might get fifteen minutes of life, since it denotes a compulsive male opinion-giver and is therefore perfectly suited for tv pundits, but it is really too weak to survive.
planning for development
in their well circulated book, politics, economics and welfare (1953), robert dahl and charls lindblom have argued that the critical question is not how to plan but (a) who shall plan (b) for what purpose (c) in what condition and (d) with what devices? many other economists of the world have endorsed this argument.
not missing unmin
the united nations mission to nepal, unmin, is to be thanked profusely for its efforts with the peace process and graciously shown the door when its term expires on january 15. in the meantime, nepali political actors, including the maoists, must concentrate on making successful a unique process that was designed by nepali stakeholders, starting with the 12-point understanding of 2005.
hiv positive people and stigma
world aids day 2010 was recently observed. to create awareness, our government also observed the day in collaboration with the ngos. but do we think really about the situation of the hiv positive persons in our country? they are often discriminated against and stigmatised in different ways. an hiv positive person is considered polygamous, even if he/she is not, in bangladesh where polygamy is treated negatively by the society. he/she faces hatred, and is often shunned by his/her own friends and family.
