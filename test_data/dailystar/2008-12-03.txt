parties yet to reveal manifestoes
it is intriguing that with barely four weeks to go before the country goes to the general elections, the political parties are yet to make public their manifestoes on the basis of which they mean to gain support at the ballot box. in fact, by now the manifestoes outlining the positions of the parties on the pressing issues ought to have been in place and a good degree of public debate should have been generated on them. while we understand that the parties are working on them, we still feel that voters should have been given an opportunity to make their informed choices on the issues reflected in the manifestoes a little earlier than now.
obama's new team
the hallmark of a good leader is his ability to choose the right person for the right job. in the case of the us president- elect the rationale behind his choice of secretaries and heads of important national institutions seems unassailable. the fact that he has chosen his rival hillary clinton in the democratic primaries to head the state department and his decision to retain robert gates as secretary of defense go only to demonstrate the inclusive nature in the choice of his political team.

going after iran?
the news report published by you on 24 november is the warning siren announcing the impending attack on iran by israel. the trigger finger of israeli armed forces is itching to go after iran, their lust for muslim blood is still not satisfied!
crucial sectors
nothing remarkable has yet taken place in our country as far as the expansion of the industrial sector is concerned. financial constraints and lack of technological support are said to have been the main reasons behind this situation. however, in no way can we ignore the base of our main economic developmentagriculture sector. nor can the expansion of the former sector be overlooked, for it is of great importance in developing a country rapidly.
traffic congestions
refer to the letter dated d.s 01.11.08 by aminul islam with the above heading where he emphasized the movement of trains. i do agree with him but what i think aminul islam missed out is or got confused with the american study of 130 cities is the commuters who travel in trains do not live in the city and are mostly residing minimum 60 miles not kilometres outside those cities. they come to work in and around the city by train. this is also a regular practice for many in europe as the cost of living outside the city is much lower than the main city.

our politics
according to "dialectic process", there are "thesis", "antithesis" and finally "synthesis". if we try to analyse our politics, we may term the rule of the al right after the independence the "thesis".
mumbai attacks
it is not a question of religion. it is purely political. whenever a problem occurs surrounding political issues involving a muslim nation or any adverse situation with a group which has muslim members, the term 'islamic terrorism' is loosely used. india has been facing terrorist attacks from all corners including kashmir, assam and the south. with muslim extremism, maoism, hindu fanaticism and other forms of hooliganism - india is now faced with the challenge of safeguarding the largest democracy in the world. a fierce suppressive response from the government may further jeopardise india's democracy. diplomacy is required with the cooperation from neighbours.
admission test
i would like to draw your kind attention to the admission tests of sher-e-bangla agricultural university and government dental colleges on the same date and time to be held on 5 december 2008 at 10.00am. this coincidence has created great frustration among the candidates seeking admission in the first year courses of agricultural and dental education, because they have purchased admission forms from both of these educational establishments.
nomination business
what i saw on television, the way mp candidates gave job interviews, looked like a private company hiring an employee. the way the parties distribute the parliamentary seats among themselves reminds me of the story of the monkey distributing the cake (banorer pitha vagh). where is democracy? where are people's voices? the base of democracy is debate and election. from my constituency the candidate should be chosen by local party members, not from dhaka. he or she must be a local party member for at least three years, also requires three years as a tax-paying local resident. if there's more than one candidate, then locals arrange a debate and by the secret voting system, where only a member who has at least three years of membership can elect the candidate from the constituency. only the central executive committee can approve the nomination. if there are any serious allegations against the candidate, the committee can ask locals for a second choice. this culture must begin from the grassroots level to electing the party chief. at least every three years there must be party counselling for a leadership race. our party leaders are afraid to go to any debate or party leadership contest because they don't have any vision or leadership quality, so they are selected on the basis of family backgrounds. but it is not a family business.
parenting magazine
recent research from the new fields of epigenetic and social neuro-science has found out that everything we think, say, do and experience has a profound impact on everything and everyone around us - especially our innocent children! so, modern parents ought to create a congenial atmosphere in order to educate, nurture and raise children. and for this reason, every conscious parent really needs to know about vaccinations, autism, adhd, sensory integration issues, education, learning challenges and styles, emotional intelligence, food, chemicals, nutrition and health, how children think, learn and develop, which are the most nurturing and supportive parenting approaches.
men and women
in our holy book, it is mentioned that women and men are equal. but men claim that women have been created to cater to their wishes (whims and fantasies), give birth to children to perpetuate the family line, manage the home and be responsible for the smooth running of it, together with all issues related to family. men, on the other hand, they claim, are ordered to earn their daily bread, a very difficult and arduous task, and return to the family fold to be pampered by their women. this is the role of man.
ban smoking
we know smoking is a bad habit. but in spite of most of the smokers knowing the consequences of smoking, they have not given up this habit. in fact, people earn money for a better living and should spend on things that are not harmful. our new generation smokes as a fashion or style without knowing its bad effects. view the page international
