it all started with the oil prices going through the roof having a massive impact on economies around the world. countries found themselves grappling with it. then came the inevitable- global warming, affecting every aspect of life and becoming more and more menacing. erratic and fierce storms and hurricanes wrecking towns and cities struck with unbelievable ferocity, never seen before. forest fires ravaged and destroyed wide swathe of forests and natural habitats. as we were taking stock of the situation came the breaking news of global food crisis, the price hike, food shortage world over, not even the usa was spared, empty godowns, food riots, famine, starvation and malnutrition. we also learned about crops cultivated for bio-fuel as an alternative to oil and used to run cars and machines aggravating the food crisis. global warming caused unprecedented floods, storms and natural disasters. the frightening situation was absorbed slowly as we came across more earth shaking news.

save our natural gas
once upon a time it was heard that bangladesh was floating on natural gas. if we didn't sell our gas to other countries, our country might have exploded! but it is a matter of great regret that our natural gas will be finished by 2011. i think there are many reasons behind this. the most important reason is the pipeline gas. because of pipeline system people keep wasting the valuable natural gas.
telephone and visa
telephone: we can talk to 35 or more countries at a reasonably economical rate i.e. @ tk 7.50 per minute--- to the usa, canada and so on. but we can't talk to our neighbouring country india, which is also a member of saarc. we have more friends, relatives and business partners in india than new zealand, canada or finland. even we have thousands of bangladeshis in middle eastern countries who are the largest foreign exchange remitting people but they do not fall in the category of eisd. nearly 10% of the population of bangladesh has somebody in india whom they need to talk to very often for various purposes. but the economy rate of telephone conversation is not applicable for india. will the respected special adviser to the ca kindly look into the matter?
