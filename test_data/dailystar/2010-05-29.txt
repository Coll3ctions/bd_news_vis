a most tragic death
we are deeply saddened by the tragic death of khandaker khanjahan samrat on thursday. the heart-rending manner of the buet student's death is a reminder once more of the menace which roads and bad drivers have become. we have repeatedly spoken of what must be done to ensure security of life on our roads. with a rapidly increasing density of population in the urban areas, it is only natural that the number of vehicles on the roads will also go up. unfortunately, such factors have not been complemented by measures towards improved road safety. conservative estimates alone place the annual number of deaths from road accidents in the country at more than four thousand. the figure could certainly be a lot higher. one can of course argue that accidents can and do happen everywhere. but what makes matters rather different in bangladesh is the quality of drivers behind the wheels here, especially on public transport.

penalties of fame
this was, in truth, a poor world cup. it's a saying among dutch football fans that poor quality tournaments are always won by the germans and, while dutch-german enmity ought to be borne in mind, this tournament most definitely added weight to the notion.west germany, soon to become plain old germany after reunification, hit the ground running in the group stages with a 4-1 thrashing of yugoslavia and a 5-1 thumping of the united arab emirates. lothar matthäus had been released from his marking role of 1986 and was leading the attacking charge. he grabbed three goals in those first two games, setting out his stall for a finals of immense personal achievement.

this wasn't really an upset. zimbabwe were the stronger side of the two, which showed in the assured manner of a tall chase, set up by fliers from brendan taylor and hamilton masakadza and finished off with 10 balls to spare by a cool-on-debut charles ervine. the return of high-profile cricket to zimbabwe put smiles on the faces of a spirited crowd, built mostly of school children, as they meticulously beat india for the first time in eight years. a weakened india side's only creditable spell came when rohit sharma scored 69 off the last 36 balls he faced to score his maiden odi century and give india a fighting total on a flat track.

can't afford to fail again
the difference between a statesman and a politician is that the first looks at the future while the second remains stuck in the present. prime minister manmohan singh shows such a streak at times and jettisons the deadening hand of politics. his statement at his maiden press conference to have "good ties with pakistan" indicates his determination to come to terms with the sub-continental realities. a hostile neighbour is an irritant, which you can ignore only at your peril.

biodiversity for development and poverty alleviation
development processes and biodiversity are somehow interlinked (mcneely, 2002). ecosystem services can shape the development paths of a country, region, or locality e.g. whether it chooses to pursue agriculture, timber production, fishing, tourism or any combination of these or other productive sectors. the world economy and national and sub-national economies are largely dependent on biodiversity. many developing countries rely on the export of natural resources such as agricultural commodities, raw materials and ecotourism services. in developing countries biodiversity, the natural capital, is estimated to be a quarter of total wealth as compared to 13% in middle income countries and 2% in high income oecd countries.

“i belong to the world . . .”
such goes the strapping spirit and confidence of a poet: a poet of the bengalis, bangladesh, and the world as well, a poet who was a patriot, composer and a myriad minded writer. nazrul once said, “even though i was born in this country (bengal), in this society, i don't belong to just this locale. i belong to the world”. he was by nature and conviction a people's poet. his work, full of vivacity, brought a new note of robustness in bengali literature. he was crowned the 'rebel poet' in 1972 as the national poet of bangladesh.

childhood hypertension, a growing concern
blood pressure is no longer an adult entity. one may suffer from high blood pressure or hypertension at any age. one may account such illness due to the complications of certain diseases, whereas another group may acquire hypertension just for their changing lifestyle. the consequence of such flunky habit is obesity. sedentary lifestyle including remote control electronics, escalator, sports car, junk foods — all may be the blessings of modern era but at the same time denounced the young frantic generation with unhealthy state. obesity and heart disease just go side by side.

awami league in power
lost priorities and opportunities
did the two year intervention by the military that backed fakruddin ahmed's caretaker government teach any political lessons to the political parties in bangladesh? the answer is unfortunately no. the culture of confrontation and ideological contestation are very much parts of bangladesh's political culture where the two political parties refuse to cooperate. the awami league (al) won a landslide victory in december 2008, which generated the hope of democratization and a change in the confrontational politics that has plagued the nation. people sincerely believed that the two years of military intervention has certainly taught the parties a lesson. expressing such sentiment the bangladesh nationalist party (bnp) general secretary said “we should replace the existing political culture with a fair one. i won't see your face just because you hold different political ideals or there's a difference of opinion…this attitude can never be helpful for democracy." view the page star books review
does civil society matter?
a proof of widespread charlatanism in bangladesh is how we go by shallow and superficial ideas about important issues. one may easily place the example of our handling of the concept of a civil society. civil society is what we nowadays mention off and on. very recently one typically important person here came to call it 'evil' even. it is difficult to pinpoint when this phrase came to acquire wide currency in our country, but once it settled in, nobody looked back before using it to mean this, that and what not.
perspectives of a bhutto
fatima bhutto has taken great pains in writing this book. she conducted a series of interviews both in and outside pakistan of the persons who were either related to the bhutto family in different ways or in the knowledge of affairs as media people. the writing indicates that the author is in quest of searching the glory and merit of her late lamented father murtaza bhutto, the first son of za bhutto, former prime minister of pakistan who was hanged by his protege general ziaul haque through the so-called trial held by the army influenced civil court. throughout the book i have found the agony of electra for securing justice for her father. the book opens with the chapter where she has narrated the painful incident of the shooting of her father. when she first hears the sound of shots of firearms, she frantically tries to contact her aunt benazir bhutto then prime minister of pakistan. but, according to her, benazir's oleaginous husband asif ali zardari (presently president of pakistan) refuses to give in. finally it is he who confirms that mortuza has been shot. can it be thought that the brother of the prime minister can be so openly shot and killed without the blessing of the state? but, of course, this is the legacy of pakistan.
stirrings in the heart
poetry elevates the soul. it sharpens the senses. best of all, it explores the entirety of being. that happens to be at the core of this work. do not be surprised by the bilingual nature of it. there are the poems in the original, by zahida meherunnissa. and then there are the english versions of them, crafted into meticulous form by feiroj adams. you might argue that there is a straying of the rules here in that the poems come in a package, that is, in a single volume. obviously, though, adams was too moved by meherunnissa's poetry to consider coming forth with them separately. and thus you have the pleasure of a work, coming to you per courtesy of meherunnissa, enhanced through the constructive engagement, as it were, of feiroj adams.
of poetry and science
the book under review, although a small publication, yet contains some important observations on our national poet, kazi nazrul islam, who is popularly known as the rebel poet. we know that nazrul islam was a genius with versatile talents. till now much research on the literary aspects of the poet's outstanding works has been conducted and a lot of unknown findings have also been released. but as far as this reviewer's knowledge goes, no research has so far been undertaken to explore the scientific aspects of nazrul's wonderful poetic creations. the author of the work mohabiggani kobi nazrul undertook research work to explore the scientific messages hidden in the poetic verses of the great poet. as revealed by the author, it was poet nazrul who hinted at the arrival of the mobile phone (or mutho phone) in his famous poem sangkalpo :
