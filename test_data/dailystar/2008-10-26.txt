it is disconcerting that sixty percent of the recommendations so far put forward by the regulatory reforms commission (rrc) could not be implemented because of the prevailing attitude of non-cooperation from different government organisations. in plain and simple language it is known as "redtapism" - an affliction of being averse to change. though it has been formed to suggest ways to generate dynamism in governance, the bottlenecks are frustrating the commission's efforts. the names of such important government bodies as the ministry of environment, board of investment (boi) and registrar of joint stock companies and firms have come up in a recent exclusive interview with the rrc chief akbar ali khan. he has been candid enough to point out that the delay in implementation stems not only from bureaucratic levels but also from those beyond.

old dhaka
the old town area was the main part of dhaka 50 years back. but now its condition is terrible. the roads are so narrow that two cars cannot pass at a time. the shops and hotels occupy the roads. in many footpaths there are holes and the drains are open and many are in such deplorable condition that it become hard to walk through even. the markets here in old town contain no parking spaces. as a result, most of the time the roads face traffic jam. the roads are broken. the manholes are open which is very dangerous and everyday accidents are occurring. the dustbins are on the road and are so smelly that one cannot walk straight. even the buildings are made without any plan and design.
pertinent points
what is the difference between this present caretaker government and our previous so called democratically elected governments? answer: no difference. they are all the same. this government is simply making blunders when it comes to making crucial decisions.
industrial pollutants
rapid industrialisation creates high demand for energy & water. waste generation and thermal pollution are general features of industrial development. pollution is the main cause of environmental degradation. environmental threats to health in the industrialized nations are also a matter of great concern.
jamaat and constitution
let's hit at the crux of the issues.
poisoned milk
the current milk scandal in china is not only a dangerous problem for that country, as thousands of children are suffering and three of them have already died, but for other countries also. this is a problem for us in bangladesh. the trouble started when the manufacturers began to use the banned chemical, normally used in plastics, to make it appear richer in protein.
price of gas
the government is going to take a decision to raise the price of gas. it goes without saying that we are suffering due to the persistent price hike. if the price of gas is increased, the prices of necessary goods & foods will also increase.
metro rail
we hail the government's decision of undertaking the feasibility study and subsequent construction of metro rail dhaka and thank the communications adviser, bangladesh railways and all concerned for the long overdue decision.
climate change
today one of the hotly deliberated topics is the issue of climate change. the climate of the world is changing fast. the scorching heat from the sun comes directly. the temperature will increase day by day due to the greenhouse effect. the main contributor to the greenhouse effect is carbon-di-oxide produced by the burning of fossil fuel. thus, they trap heat in the troposphere and stop it from escaping to the space. the net result of the heating of the earth's surface by this type of phenomenon is the greenhouse effect. because of greenhouse gas emission, the world is warming up, glaciers are melting, the sea level is rising, and the world climate is changing - all at a faster rate than ever before.
curse of dowry
these days the curse of dowry is claiming many lives. in our country this appears to be a major problem, though campaign against this social malady is going on.
weekly holiday
we all know that we are a poor third world country which is dependent on foreign aid and donations for its survival. however, when we look into the government calendar of holidays, it gives us a different picture of our socio-economic condition. it seems that we are an affluent nation!
icl issue
players have gone to icl. it is an administrative failure as well as players' inability to handle the matter in a proper way.
judges' wigs
a centuries old tradition of wearing a white horse-hair wig in court in the united kingdom (uk) has ended for many judges starting from 01 october 2008. subsequently, a simpler new dress code came into force.
greed and need
unfettered free market capitalism is motivated and recklessly driven by greed. possibly it was dale carnegie, who wrote "the more you get, the more you want".
should we be embarrassed ?
i have just found out that the judge felt embarrassed to quash the proceedings against khaleda zia in barapukuria coal mine corruption case petition!
automobile menace
hats off to ms farzana afrin of mirpur for her above letter printed in ds of 10 oct 08. she has in short, logical and factual sentences portrayed an accurate and realistic picture of the traffic gridlocks that have brought dhaka to its knees. she has described the evils of free parking on public roads as a major cause of tailbacks, even when there are laws against it.
solar power
although the world has reached the age of modernization, but still bangladesh cannot afford 24 hours of complete electricity everywhere. the villages are still in darkness and only a few have received electricity. even the dhaka city suffers from load shedding and so many factories and industrial units are facing the same problem.
ethics
ethics means moral values. it is an important virtue to be gained. it helps a man to decide what to do. view the page international
