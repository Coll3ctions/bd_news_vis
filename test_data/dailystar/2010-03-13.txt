the amendments suggested by the cabinet committee on the proposed law for the anti-corruption commission (acc) will lead to a hamstrung, dwarfed and dependent body which will not be able to serve the purpose that the nation needs it for-to fight corruption in an effective and all encompassing manner. the committee, which was a collections of bureaucrats, did what such groups do best, proposed that special permission be sought before acc could proceed against fellow bureaucrats. if the cabinet approves the proposals, which it is likely to consider on the 15th, it will be making a mistake of historic proportions. let us explain why.

in ibsen land. . . some stories
in oslo in august 2006, a group of individuals that included me was shown around the ibsen museum which was at one time henrik ibsen's home. the bangladesh delegation to the grand closing of the year-long ibsen centenary program in oslo included md. quazi manzur-i-mowla, kamaluddin nilu, professor sonia nishat amin, professor ahsanuzzaman, ashish khondakar and the writer. foreign participants' visit to the museum was an important part of the closing of the programme. on 23 may 2006, the norwegian queen opened the new ibsen museum and a comprehensive exhibit featuring ibsen´s life and work. on that date exactly 100 years ago, ibsen passed away at his home in arbins gate 1. for the last 11 years of his life he lived in an apartment at arbins gate 1, oslo. we were told that the apartment-turned-museum has the playwright's own furniture as well as the original fixtures, décor and colors. the visit thus took us backstage and introduced us to his private life, private belongings. the museum tells a personal story about the private life of an aging ibsen. one gets an authentic impression of the playwright's home. the restoration of floors, walls, ceilings and surfaces was done according to on-site archeological findings supplemented by historic research.
lal shak . . .
the sun glares overhead and our shoes squish in the occasional puddles of mud until we enter the courtyard. a sudden gust of wind precedes us, blowing the covering off her hair as she crouches over the clay stove, stirring something with a bronze spatula. inevitably, she is wearing an unstarched cream sari which had aged just like her, gracefully. my sister and i enter the grounds noiselessly, creep up behind her as she concentrates on the quality of her lal shak , red spinach, and erupt with a sudden yell. she pretends to be frightened, prompting us into fits of giggles. after a tight hug or two, depending on how long ago she had last seen us, she goes back to her cooking, making sure the lal shak is the right shade with the smell of the burnt red chilies stinging our nostrils. nanu is preparing the feast for her little sparrows.

obedience
anything that is attracted by your self
be advised to give it up.
your have gained life from god,
and so to him your self resign.
he who obeys the word from conscience
great persons call him obedience.
he who wittingly disobeys injunctions divine,
slowly shall engender his own ruin.
he who all the time disobeys
receives from god all disgrace.
obedience is the beautiful edifice of service
its exterior is devotion, its entrance patience.

significance of hasina's prc visit
prime minister sheikh hasina's official visit to china is scheduled to start from march 17th. during her last term, she had undertaken an official visit to china within two months of taking office which was also her first official overseas visit. whether this delay reflects any displeasure the chinese have with bangladesh can only be a subject of speculation. nevertheless, under the bnp's last term of office and in the one year and a little more of the al tenure, the chinese have not seen much from the bangladesh side to warm their hearts or to reflect their strategic value to bangladesh.
security détente before political détente
in spite of media hype and outside pressures, the recent indo-pak dialogue has once again been inconclusive. in fact, it ended without even a commitment for a future meeting. only promises to stay in-touch have been made. the main thrust has been on a blame-game usually prompted by the respective security establishments, amply demonstrating the huge trust deficit. all meetings end only with photo ops and the real issues remain unresolved. during the last decade these two countries came close to sorting out issues like the siachin glacier and sir creek but the general mistrust did not allow for clinching these.

the making of a superman
the period between the beginning of december and the end of march, these four months, symbolize for the bangalee ethos several aspects --- joy, loss, pride, dedication, patience and courage. these few weeks encapsulate many historical events that are sign posts, that are inter-related and fuse together to create for us the very foundation of our nation.
words behind the making of history
oratory has since the beginning of civilised existence kept people in thrall. shakespeare provided a clue to the riveting nature of speeches in his plays. you think here of brutus and mark antony in julius caesar, of the many ways in which they played with words to convince the audience of the justness of the causes they held dear. but that was literature. in life lived from day to day, through the vagaries of politics, oratory has often been raised to the level of art. in bangladesh's case, the speeches of sheikh mujibur rahman were ammunition, over the years, in the defence of liberty. gandhi was not a rousing speaker, but the calm religiosity he brought into his words drove the point home. and then there was syed badrudduja, whose command of bengali, urdu and english was demonstrated to huge effect in his speeches, particularly in pre-partition india.
