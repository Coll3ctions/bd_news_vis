most of the public universities are affected by student politics. student politics is a cacophonous word. when a student enrols into university and stays in hall, he/she is compelled to engage in politics and political activities. most of the time of a student is spent in processions, meetings and other political activities. so he/she gets very little time to study.

father marino
star insight's cover story on father marino rigon, in its january 3rd. issue by rafi hossain, is indeed a moving portrait of the life of a noble man who came to bangladesh way back in 1953, to serve the people of a remote locality in mongla. unfortunately, he has not been recognised by the country which he dearly loves and served selflessly; and where he wants to live and die and be buried! he is indeed a true bangladeshi, in thought, word and deeds! how many such persons can we find today?

freedom fighters
since centuries freedom fighters have always fought the occupiers and invaders for their homeland. the occupiers have always termed the freedom fighters terrorists, that is what israel is terming the freedom fighters of palestine. israel didn't exist before 1948, it was illegally settled on the palestinian land with the help of western forces. if the westerners were true friends of the jews they would have provided or gifted a part of their own land to the zionists. grabbed or looted things cannot be a good gift!
israel's brutal assault
as the assault of israel on gaza strip that started on the christmas eve lingered on, the death toll continued to climb. it reached a staggering figure of 850 in 16 days. in other words, gaza has become a valley of death. civilians --men, women and children-- were being killed by the brute force of the state of the art war machine of a menacing israel. it is clear that the people of palestine are helpless and at the mercy of the marauding force that has been unleashed on them.
