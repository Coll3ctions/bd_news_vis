bar on private coaching
the government has at last put a bar on private coaching by teachers outside the class hours. the stricture should have come long ago. private tuition had become a roaring business, and had reached an obnoxious level with the mushrooming of a huge number of coaching centers, mostly in the last decade, and many run by serving school teachers; and this at the expense of classroom teaching, which, naturally, was bound to suffer. instead of doing justice to the time allotted to conducting classes at the school students were told indirectly by some teachers that those who wanted to secure good marks should seek the help of the teacher outside the school hours preferably at his or her house or the coaching centre which the teacher ran. view the page sports

m&m tie down kiwis
when he lost the toss, kumar sangakkara said a team that couldn't win chasing under the low dambulla floodlights, which is a tall order, was not a good team. big words, all right, but one way of backing those words is to bowl sides out for low totals. on a helpful pitch, lasith malinga was too good, angelo mathews canny, and new zealand were dismissed for 192. bj watling's half-century on debut, and nathan mcculum's fighting 36 with the tail, might have just given new zealand a fighting total, though, considering the amount of seam movement on offer.

“brother sun, sister moon”: a cinematic paean to nature
it's easy to be cynical. easy to bisect and trisect a movie till the film experience is completely lost. there's bound to a lot of flak reserved for a film like “brother sun, sister moon”. for one, director franco zeffirelli, (known for his beautifully crafted “romeo and juliet”) gives simplistic treatment to an otherwise complex subject. for another, the storyline seems more a hagiography than an objective picture of the early life of preacher st francis of assisi.

cops and human rights in perspective
newspaper reports have it that the dhaka metropolitan police and the national human rights commission have sharply differing views on many crucial issues, in particular on the vexed subject of violation of human rights. there are complaints in the report that our cops are trying in vain to justify human rights violation.
hiding shame of emergency
it is a coincidence, but not insignificant, that a plucky journalist has reported on the eve of august 15 that the congress has "destroyed" all papers relating to our second independence in january 1977. if history could, indeed, be so easily rewritten, hitler would have blotted out from the world's memory all the atrocities and excesses he and his nazi party had committed.

riparian vegetation: a corridor for environmental stability
the word "riparian" is derived from the latin word 'ripa' (river bank).vegetations bordering water bodies are technically known as riparian vegetations. these vegetations are also called riverine or gallery vegetations as they are grown adjacent to or near rivers. plant habitats and communities along the river margins and banks are called riparian vegetation, characterized by hydrophilic plants. riparian vegetations form the transition between the aquatic and the terrestrial ecosystem. a riparian zone or riparian area is the interface between land and water body. riparian is also the proper nomenclature for one of the fifteen terrestrial biomes of the earth. they occur in many forms including grassland, woodland, wetland or even non-vegetative.
save flood vulnerable eastern fringe of dhaka
united nations warned that a quarter of bangladesh coastline could be inundated and about 17% of its land mass would go under water, if the sea rises 3 feet in the next 50 years. approximately 30 million people will be displaced from their homes, making them 'climate refugees'. a recent world bank report lists bangladesh as one of the 12 countries most at risk for climate-related problems. though bangladesh's contribution to global green house gas emissions is one of the lowest in the world, its low topography, disadvantageous geographic location, high density of population etc make it more vulnerable to climate change. view the page literature
bangladeshis writing in english
english is no more the patrimony of the anglo saxons. it is now a universal public property. by the british colonial train, it travelled almost the entire world, came in touch with myriad people and their languages, and enriched itself as the world's number one language. not only as a comfortable means of communication between the peoples of the opposite poles and hemispheres, but also as a medium of creative writing has english been deliberately taken up by writers of the formerly colonized countries. the number is multiplying with the rise of postcolonial / diaspora consciousness. the situation is as if the colonizer prospero (the tempest) is being written back by the colonized caliban in the same language the latter was taught by the former. the process of colonization has proved a double edged weapon whose other edge has now been sharper than the one used earlier by the colonizers.

foods for healthy fasting
millions of muslims are now shaping up their lives specially the diet to coincide with the changing schedule of the holy month of ramadan. through fasting, we learn to manage healthy eating habits, improve self-control, discipline and improve overall health. however, the fasts of ramadan can worsen a person's health if the healthy diet is not followed. here are some guidelines on diet explored for readers to keep heal and hearty in this ramadan and afterwards:
do not suffer for hernia in silence
a hernia is a protrusion of an organ through an abnormal opening or weak wall in the body. most hernias occur when a piece of intestine slips through a weakness in the abdominal wall, creating a bulge you can see and feel. hernias can develop around the naval, in the groin, or any place where you may have had a surgical incision. some hernias are present at birth. others develop slowly over a period of months or years. hernias also can come on quite suddenly.
lifting heavy weights not necessary for muscle
current gym dogma holds that to build muscle size you need to lift heavy weights. however, a new study conducted at mcmaster university has shown that a similar degree of muscle building can be achieved by using lighter weights. the secret is to pump iron until you reach muscle fatigue.
guide for healthy ramadan
get rid of constipation
constipation is one of the most common problems encountered during the month of ramadan. constipation for long days can cause piles (haemorrhoids), fissures (painful cracks in the anal canal) and indigestion with a bloated feeling. eating too many refined carbohydrates, drinking too little water and not eating enough fibre are the causes behind this. be active, eat more fibre and complex carbohydrates, drink more water, use bran for baking, and use brown flour when making bread will help to keep your bowel motions regular. include lots of fruit and vegetables in your diet and increase the fiber content of your food. taking isabgol is effective but has a delayed effect. if the problem persists, a short course of laxatives may help.
when recreational drug use turns into addiction?
recreational drug use is a practice that dates to prehistoric times. many people consume drugs to have fun, to bring a variation in life. the practice is potentially dangerous. because the majority of recreational drug users find their habit becomes an obsession. they begin to abuse the drugs that once brought them so much pleasure and find that they rely on them just to get though the day. eventually, they lose control over their actions and become drug addicts who will do whatever it takes to get their next high.
blood test and insulin do not invalidate fasting
if you are a diabetic and need to take insulin 3 times a day, do not worry about fasting. you can also check your blood sugar during fasting and get insulin. there are no barriers regarding it. muslim scholars recommended that blood tests for glucose monitoring and taking insulin do not invalidate the fasting of ramadan. medical matters that do not invalidate fasting include inhaler, eye,ear and nasal drops, enemas, tooth extraction and treatment of injuries. insertion of anything into the vagina such as pessaries, or a speculum, or the doctor's fingers for the purpose of medical examination, insertion of medical instruments or iud into the womb, anything that enters the urinary tract of a male or female, such as a catheter tube, or medical scopes, or opaque dyes inserted for the purpose of x-rays, or medicine, or a solution to wash the bladder do not invalidate fast. oxygen or anaesthetic gases, local anaesthesia and any injection except those used for parenteral nutrition can be used for treatment purpose. view the page strategic issues
enlargement of nato: offering stability or threat?
north atlantic treaty organization (nato) is the predominant military alliance of the world. after the second world war, major countries of western europe seeking a general line of defence against the so-called soviet aggression and the expansion of communisms formed the us-led military alliance in 1949 for ensuring their collective security. starting from only 12 member countries, the alliance is now enjoying the membership of 28 states. one of the fundamental principles of the north atlantic treaty (under which the alliance formed) is: "an armed attack against one or more of them (member countries) in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all" (article 5). critics of the alliance often argue that with the demise of the soviet union and the end of the cold war era, the relevance of nato has far gone; yet its existence and even the continual expansion only serves the united states' hegemonic role in europe and elsewhere on earth. although, it is normally hypothesized that nato's self-designation as an institution for upholding peace and security in europe and its proven willingness to use force for conflict management and conflict prevention in areas outside nato member states have played a major role in bringing about the currently existing benign security environment in europe.
a new fillip to bangladesh-india relations
there seems to be mixed feelings about the indian finance minister's recent visit to bangladesh, a lot of it of course coming down party lines. last time, when he was here, he by-passed a request from the leader of the opposition for a meeting and instead found time to meet the controversial general moyeen who during his stranglehold on power under the caretaker government had openly boasted that he would resolve all outstanding problems with india on the eve of a visit he undertook to new delhi at that time. although bangladeshis are easily susceptible to conspiracy theories and the opposition bnp not inclined too see anything good in india, pranab mukherjee on his part has given some genuine encouragement to the conspiracy prone bangladeshis and the bnp. this time too there was no meeting with khaleda zia but he reportedly found time during his 4 hours' stay in dhaka for another controversial meeting with three top al leaders who did not find cabinet berths on issue of loyalty to the party leader.

the dark world of political murder
assassins have regularly been part of humanity's darker side. and assassinations have throughout history been an insidious part of politics, or a mutation of it into a calling of the lowest of categories in human behaviour. for those of us who inhabit south asia, assassinations have done a good deal to undermine our perspectives on politics and on life in general. in bangladesh, the assassinations of sheikh mujibur rahman and his political associates at the hands of soldiers in 1975 were to leave an entire nation in a tailspin only three years after it had gained freedom from pakistan in a bloody war of liberation. in pakistan itself, the judicial murder of zulfikar ali bhutto in 1979 and then the killing of his daughter benazir bhutto in 2007 only demonstrated the degree to which assassinations could go in damaging a country. but, of course, pakistan first went through assassination in october 1951, when its first prime minister liaquat ali khan was murdered in rawalpindi.
of fairy tales, of lives really lived
bollywood is a strange, quixotic place. first, you wonder why that term 'bollywood' has come to be attached to the world's largest movie industry. couldn't someone have devised a better term rather than aping hollywood? that aping has led to such puerility as lollywood (to describe the pakistani movie industry in lahore) and dhaliwood, here in bangladesh. then comes the fairy tale aspect of the indian film industry. it still tends to operate in a world of unreal songs, fantasy dances and love stories that always end up with the man and the woman ready to live happily ever after. realism is something you are yet to get out of bollywood.
weightism survivors and seasonal employees
it is these days quite fashionable to consider oneself politically correct. look around you. you don't have red indians any more, only native americans. though you might consider barack obama as america's first black president, you must be extra careful in avoiding using the old, denigrating 'negro' while describing him or any of his kind. it is african-americans that you have today. on a lighter level, do you realise that there are no housewives any more today? there are only homemakers, whatever that means. it tends to remind you of a rather pernicious term, home-wreckers, one that you associate with men and women who have nothing better to do than making a mess of other people's lives by falling in love, or lust, with other people's spouses. and then there is the way you describe a child whose intelligence is obviously of a poor quality. but, no, you cannot suggest by any means that he is unintelligent. he is merely one who has an attention deficit disorder.
secrets behind a system
the us supreme court is deemed as the conscience of the state and the highest body in the dispensation of the rule of law and justice. the legal and other democratic institutions of the country and elsewhere follow the path the sc shows. but in the book, the nine: inside the secret world of the supreme court, the writer reveals the untold and hushed up stories of the jurists, political parties and other state apparatus involved in various shady deals usually beyond the imagination of a layman.
