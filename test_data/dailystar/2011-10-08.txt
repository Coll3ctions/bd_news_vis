the pains that come with reading
in this enormous collection of his writings, asafuddowlah emerges as a think-tank all by himself. nothing escapes his discerning eyes, reflective mind and a highly analytical faculty of brain that the one reading perceives while going through the myriads of topics covered. the entries contain not only information that constitute knowledge but also carry some definite messages that are most thought-provoking, however brief some of those may be. the overriding message throughout the book is expressed in a normative style in his deliberations that manifest the author's heartfelt concern for all kinds of deviations one witnesses more and more with the passage of time since those veer away from a desirable standard and quality that is to be followed in human life. asafuddowlah is genuinely in pain seeing all this as an eye-witness in various dealings encountered in his life. one may as well infer that in case such occurrences keep on going unabated, these are bound to cause panic and therein lies the other major concern of this book. the writer's voice throughout the book is loud and clear; his rhetoric is unequivocal, logical; expressions are bold and often tense. assuredly this has been possible because most of these articles were published in the bangladesh today he himself once edited. however, through his utterances, asafuddowlah emerges first and foremost as a moralist, albeit in a pedantic manner.
