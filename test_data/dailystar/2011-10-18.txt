we couldn't wait until halloween to share this spooky thermal image of bats in flight. provided by the texas parks and wildlife department, this image was taken by boston university researchers trying to better understand how bats navigate the air in response to weather, bug activity and climate change .
new sun-bound probe
a nasa spacecraft set to launch in 2015 will come eight times closer to the sun than any previous probe, operating within the star's scorching outer atmosphere, or corona. the $750 million solar probe will study the birthplace of the solar wind. during its expected seven-year lifetime, solar probe will make seven gravity slingshots around venus, each time getting closer to the sun. at its closest approach, it will orbit the sun from within the outer part of the corona, at a distance of between 8 and 10 solar radii from the centre of the sun. that is much closer than the previous record holder, the helios spacecraft, which came within 67 solar radii of the star in the 1970s.scientists hope the probe will help solve two enduring solar mysteries: why is the sun's outer atmosphere, or corona, so much hotter than its visible surface, which lies beneath it? and what accelerates the solar wind, a stream of charged particles from the sun, to supersonic speeds? heat shield: the idea of studying the sun at close range was first proposed by the us national academy of science in 1958. but scientists have only recently been able to design heat shields for such a spacecraft within nasa's tight budgetary guidelines. the mini-bus sized solar probe will be protected from the sun's fierce radiation by a disc-shaped, carbon-composite heat shield that will be 2.
secret of stripes
many living things have stripes, but the developmental processes that create these and other patterns are complex and difficult to untangle.
who built very first motor car?
jesuit priest ferdinand verbiest, who worked in china from 1659 until his death in 1688, left a description of a five-wheel steam car he had built as a toy for the young chinese emperor enkh amgalan khaan in 1672. that is the earliest record of an auto-mobile car thus verbiest's vehicle possibly holds the very first land speed record. the vehicle was not meant for human transport and was only 2 ft (65cm) long. there is, however, no other record of the vehicle and it is not known if it was actually built. the graphic here is from an 18th century print.
