kali o kolom: magh 1415 - january 2009
this beginning-of-the-new-year issue of kali o kolom is justly an invigorating one, a sentiment that is echoed by ashrifa k nova of tejgaon, dhaka, writing in her letter to the editor that readers expecting to encounter something new in the pages of kali o kolom are seldom disappointed. the two opening articles, in a sort of contrast of two quite different authorial temperament and style, are on syed waliullah and buddhadev bose, with the former focusing on the writer's short stories while the latter one discusses bose's modernism. harishankar jaldash contributes an engrossing piece on ghanashyam choudhury's book obogahon in the context of the humanism that began to be apparent in bengali literature from the activities of the circle of writers and thinkers that included derozio-ram mohan roy-vidyasagar-madhushudhan-bankimchandra-rabindranath, with their natural sympathy for the underdogs and untouchables in a deeply caste-ridden society. the novel's action centers around the naxalite movement in the year 1977, and ghanashyam was awarded the 2001 ramananda chattapadhya memorial award for it.
two poems by ruby rahman
a patched-up poem
trees
a prose poem
surely you've noticed how, as soon as you get out of the city, the sight of trees and greenery lifts up the spirits, even to the point of elation. the reason for this, i'm certain, has to do with evolutionary psychology. our mind is essentially the same as that of our earliest ancestors on the african savanna, where foliage meant food to pluck or trap or hunt. plants and trees and grassland, so to speak, meant both nature and nurture. view the page star health

the gaza misadventure and its aftermath
the seismic impact of the recent 22-day gaza war, while exposing the vulnerability of the middle eastern order, has created a new strategic reality, accentuating the urgency of the arab-israeli peace process. the purpose of the well planned, barbaric but fruitless israeli onslaught was to extirpate hamas, the islamic resistance movement, from gaza. below is a brief analysis of the political maneuvering during the conflict, the brunt of which was borne by the battered civilian palestinians, and its aftereffect which is perceived to be more threatening than the war itself.
the geostrategic scenario of bangladesh-part ii
india is bangladesh's closest neighbour. india shares its longest border (2,840 km) with bangladesh. although the border is demarcated, there are a few unresolved issues such as enclaves and adverse possessed lands - legacy from the colonial past. the issue of water sharing of common rivers, especially of the ganges and the barrage built across it in farakka, west bengal had been the greatest irritant. some issues remain unresolved mainly due to bureaucratic dillydallying and political backsliding. more recently, the maritime boundary issues have come up. the position of the two countries on this issue is not too divergent and given the political will, the issue could be resolved to the satisfaction of both the parties. arms and drugs smuggling, human trafficking, movement of criminals and extremist elements across the border are of common concern to both the countries. thankfully, these issues are receiving due attention of both the governments.
let the victor surrender to the people
the good side of the political changeover is that an elected government has taken over from the overstaying caretakers; the bad side of it however is that the opposition has been virtually wiped out. as a result, along with the nation, awami league was also stunned by the result and refused to celebrate. democracy's indispensable institution -- the opposition - the check or brake, is missing. the emerging democratic order has virtually wiped out the 'government in waiting'. the grand alliance is a vote-catching billboard, every inch of it depends on the acumen of the ruling awami league leadership and how they are going to steer through without an effective opposition. without the culture of collective leadership, the very fundamental of parliamentary democracy, everything depends on sheik hasina. she is the all-powerful prime minister, president of the awami league, leader of the alliance and the leader of the house. overwhelming concentration of power in one hand usually produces arrogant leadership and goes against the spirit of parliamentary democracy. view the page star books review
a state in ferment, a newsman in reflection, a principle under assault. . .
nurul islam was not content to be on the stands while the history of bangladesh was being forged bit by significant bit. he was a participant. and that participation dates back to the early 1960s when, as part of a team of young bengali economists in pakistan, he played his due role in the development of what would later become known as the 'two economies' or two distinct systems theory as advocated for east and west pakistan. sure, the powers that were (and their symbol was general ayub khan) could not be receptive to the idea. implicit in the idea of two economic systems for the two wings of pakistan, or so reasoned ayub and the entrenched class of west pakistani rulers, was the eventual secession of the bengali east from the more prosperous west. but that did not preclude president ayub from summoning islam and his friends to a meeting, to ascertain the nature of their observations. the young bengalis put the argument before the military ruler as best they could. ayub listened, after which no more was heard from him.
