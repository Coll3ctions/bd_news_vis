lost in the gutter
every morning while going to school i see children of my age collecting garbage from the big garbage cans. while my morning starts with a healthy breakfast, their morning starts with collecting garbage. this crude reality makes me very sad when i imagine their lives in poverty. people are totally indifferent to child labour although the government has enacted certain laws regarding child labour. i also found out that the child labours are paid a meagre amount of money for their work only because they are children! what are the authorities doing? in the daily star and many other dailies i read how the doe fines factories for pollution and grabbing and how bsti penalizes eateries for unhygienic food etc but i have never heard or read that any balloon factory or brick factory has been penalized for letting children work there.

we are on the same side
the recent criticism by the government high ups against prof. yunus's nobel achievement reminds me of the hindi serials. the stories are mainly based on quarrel among family members. actually, this is the true reflection of our people's mentality. if we look back to our history, we will see that the people always created obstacle in the way of our great achievements. the british knew it very well that if they could break our unity, they could easily establish their rule in this subcontinent. creating dispute centring personal interests was a technique of the british to divide our nation. the british left our country many years ago. but still we can not come out of this mentality. there are some achievements that the country will remember forever. prof. yunus' winning the nobel peace prize is one of those. we the bangladeshis should not say anything against him because we are on the same side. we should remember that one can not hide obe's failures by criticising others.

the high court has stepped into the matter of humayun ahmed's new work of fiction. it has suggested that the writer take steps to correct some of the information that appears in deyal . you can, therefore, be reasonably sure that until the judiciary sees its directives taken into cognisance by the writer, deyal will remain out of the hands of readers, for quite a while.
toxic politics and detoxification
before the december 2008 election that brought sheikh hasina to power with an overwhelming parliamentary majority, the economist's report ("the nice side of democracy," november 6, 2008) had said: "what bangladeshis still do not know is whether the army's intervention has shocked the country's squabbling, petty politicians into a new approach. the world's seventh-most populous country needs a government devoted not to a perennial political vendetta, but to tackling poverty, climate change and terrorism."
an unsung hero
there have been many drivers of change in the remarkable transformation of bangladesh from a famine-stricken country always on the edge to a country now aspiring to become a middle income country. we, however, have not been so kind in celebrating all of our drivers of change. the contribution of quamrul islam siddique, the visionary founder of lged, in ushering in the first connectivity revolution via all-weather rural roads is one of the lesser-told stories of bangladesh's transformation.
trojan horse on greek shores
greece had been living beyond its means, by borrowing, even before it joined the eurozone in 2002. it gave fake statistics to the european union about its economy, hiding the huge loans it had taken. by 2009, it was revealed that greece was about to default on repaying its debtors. the debt has bloated and now stands at €355 billion, which is 165% of its gdp (2011).
our political circus
since 1991, the awami league and the bangladesh nationalist party have been coming to power alternately. just before the 1991 elections, sheikh hasina predicted that the bnp would get only 10 seats, but she herself experienced a humiliating defeat with only a little more than half the seats her rival achieved. the failure of the bnp brought the al to power in 1996. still people's perception about the two political parties did not swing too far during those elections, and so the gap in the number of parliamentary seats the two main parties got was not so big. but after having twice seen the two major parties alternately, people began to become more and more disappointed and the signs of this were reflected in election results. the national parliamentary election results in 2001 and 2008 gave landslide victory once to the bnp and then to the awami league.
