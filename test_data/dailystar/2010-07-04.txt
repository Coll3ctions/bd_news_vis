death in law enforcers' hands
reports of three deaths of people in police custody only within a span of 5 days are simply unacceptable. if police are the public face of the government then it is a very scary face indeed that the citizens are watching recently. the latest incident of death of a man mujubar by name under inexplicable circumstances has allegedly happened at the hands of the darussalam police in the city last thursday. the man was picked up from the savar area the same day in the afternoon by a group of policemen and by night his body was found floating in the turag river bearing torture marks on his lifeless body. according to the brother of the deceased, the policemen had allegedly demanded money from him for his release but when he failed to give it he was beaten to death. this stands corroborated by iqbal, the deceased person's son who described in a prominent bangla daily how the police treated his father: "they handcuffed him, gave him blows, kicked him, choked him in water by the river side, asked him for money, which his father said he didn't have, before hauling him up on to a boat." the police, however, denied all allegations of beating the person to death and rather branded him as a drug peddler.

helpless patients
it is a matter of great regret that even after many news reports in several dailies and telecasting in various satellite channels regarding the ordeals and sufferings of helpless patients in hospitals, especially in city areas, impoverished people are still facing the same misconducts of a group of hospital employees and the influence of brokers hanging and lurking around the hospitals. most of the government hospitals in city areas have been under the control of a good number of brokers, who are one of the major reasons behind the plight of patients. for instance--a few weeks back a watchman from our building went to a hospital in the city for treatment since he was suffering from tb, lever disease and bronchitis. he went to see some doctors hoping to be treated well in that hospital, but his all hopes had been shattered when he experienced the horrible ordeal on that day. after he had arrived at the hospital when he tried to communicate with the hospital authorities concerned, he was intercepted all the way by a group of brokers and told to wait. he started waiting and found those people who told him to wait were whispering with each other. a few hours later one man came to him and heard about the diseases from the watchman. afterwards he (victim) was given the promise by that broker to make the provision to help him get proper treatment. then it was nothing but just waiting as the poor helpless watchman was under the process of being swindled. at the eleventh hour he had been briefed as to how he (broker) was going to get the treatment done through undergoing a cheap surgery by the very next week on the rooftop under the open sky of that hospital, when the doctor would be available. listening to the broker exhausted feeble poor watchman came back home with a distraught face at the end of the day. he was sobbing during telling this awful tale of swindlers some days before his death. however, i would earnestly request the authorities concerned to intervene and make things better.
football craze
the world cup which is regarded as the biggest soccer event in the world started its month long journey last month.
women's rights?
will this massive craze of torturing women in our society ever come to an end? why is it that when women's rights are discussed we always find ways to back out by simply saying, “we're working on it” or “i think women have been given much more respect and rights than before through our initiatives or campaigns”? where do we, women, actually stand in a country like bangladesh, where a single woman is left all alone to fight her battles while some elite people in our society are too busy running their so called social campaigns? a survey conducted by bangladesh health and injury brought to light that over 2200 children commit suicide every year--which is almost six per day, of which four happen to be females. even in a country like bangladesh with a moderate economic growth and the increasing awareness among people, we still turn a deaf ear to the cries of the women not only in the most primitive of areas but in the city as well.
poor performance
as a cricket loving man, unless otherwise busy, i do not miss any international fixture in which bangladesh is featured. i did not miss the last four games, two tests in england and two odis of asia cup in sri lanka. i am writing this letter not because bangladesh lost all last four games, i am writing this letter just to say something to the bangladesh cricket officials about performance of our players. as a commoner fan, without having much technical knowledge, i noticed the bangladesh players are as talented as others, but i found in them some serious psychological problems.
redesigning the rickshaw
i am gratified that at last i have got a response and from a lady foreigner at that, to the 69 letters i have written on the subject over the last 2 years and 9 months. my grateful thanks to angela robinson for backing me up and for the many entertaining and informative letters from her that have appeared in ds in the recent past!
ccc elections
many political pundits will explain chittagong election results from different angles. the al has accepted the defeat gracefully. but do they learn anything from this debacle? will they take little pains to organise the party rank and file? will they choose cleaner, better and approachable candidates for dhaka city and other forthcoming elections? mps and ministers should come down to earth to meet the people.
buet
bangladesh university of engineering and technology (buet), the technological study leader of bangladesh, is enervating its reputation through some of the undermining activities during the past few years. the pioneer university was once again shut down over an amateurish behaviour of its students! the reason behind the scene is too ridiculous to explain and one may be surprised but the truth is truth. it is a pity that buet was closed several times over such untoward and unwanted incidents.
threat to officials
recently, one issue made all sensible citizens of the country worried. it is issuance of a direct threat to the government officials by a top political leader belonging to the opposition. any such direct or indirect threat will not bring any good result for the country and will harm it in the long run.
holy miraj
we are going to observe the holy miraj on july 09.
eve teasing
irene khan's write up on june 19 should serve as a stark reminder of the apparent failure to stand against the menace which has so far claimed many innocent lives. empowerment of the powerful women ( prime minister, home minister, leader of the opposition etc) is indeed meaningless if the dangerous harassment to members of their gender still continues.
bsf atrocities
it is unfortunate for the whole nation that the bsf members most frequently assault our people. very recently two bangladeshis were injured at bisnakandi stone quarry on the gowainghat border in sylhet. the injured were nasir uddin, 30, a resident of bisnakandi, and lilu miah, 28, a resident of bagaiya at gowainghat in the district.
physiotherapy college

active volcano!
withdrawing scripts from the national university, gazipur, i reached chandura to catch a lalpur bound bus. the bulky bag limited my movement and peace of mind. anxiety to have a bus and concern for the safety of the bag and inexperience led me to fall into the trap of the ticket middleman. they took from me the money in full but i found myself in the lowest class of bus. the crammed bus was always uncouthly noisy with constant haggling of the conductors over the fairs. a passenger was also beaten in the counter but the weak labourers could not protest it. the years of hard labour, low payment and humiliation has made them expendable. the rough appearance of the labourers speak volumes of their abject condition. lack of education, consciousness has prevented them from making the best use of their minimum means. the bus we were travelling on presented us the worst kind of travelling experience. it halted frequently to board and onboard the passengers. passengers swore and shouted at the conductors and the driver but to no avail. the reality is the money they get from the passengers is very little. while good buses charge 300 taka for travelling from dhaka to rajshahi, this dilapidated buses take only 100, 80 or even only 50 taka from a passenger.
hajj policy
the fitra system for hajjis means the hajj agent will collect hajjis at a rate much lower than the rate declared by the government. they generally allure the intending hajjis telling that their accommodation at mecca will be very close to holy haram, and the hajjis fall in their trap and what actually they do is take them to mecca and keep them in a house near to holy haram and after three or five days the hajjis are taken to medina sharif and from there they are escorted to mina just on the 8th day of zilhaj and after five days of hajj rituals at mina, then to arafa, arafa to mujdalifa and then again to mina. thus all the formalities are closed and the hajis are kept in a house near to mina at azizia or shirsha from where the distance of holy haram is not less than nine to ten kilometers. then the hajjis of this fitra system face a great problemthe problem is to cross the big way to come to the holy haram and engage themselves in ibadat.
a good proposal
the parliamentary standing committee on communications has recently proposed to the government to create a new ministry for railways (ds:23.06.10). i praise this proposition as it was overdue and a long felt necessity. the railway has huge manpower, huge land property and resources and enormous prospects. but as has always happened in all pristine departments in our country; lot of unnecessary, worthless and political elements in the name of workers and experts intruded into the organisations. the same has quintessentially happened in the railways. umpteen times the railway tried to sell out its property, especially precious lands to the private parties and sometimes they succeeded. though the railway is a losing concern of the government, yet the luxurious lifestyle and benefits taken from the government and the organisation by the officials and some union leaders will tell the real story of its dilemma. view the page international
