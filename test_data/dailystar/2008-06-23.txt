a new bangladesh
in 1971, a new country was created and in the past 36 years its people have struggled to build a prosperous society.
violence against women
the constitution of the people's republic of bangladesh ensures equal rights for all citizens, irrespective of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. thus women enjoy the fundamental rights of freedom of speech and expression, association and assembly which form the basis of political activity in a civil society. but in practice women are neglected and oppressed.
cricket over-publicised
the way bangladesh cricket is advancing is alarming. as we have seen, bangladesh cricket is not attracting spectators these days (the tri-nation tournament is an example). the main reason is poor performance. as a cricket fan of the tigers, i believe and agree with the rest of my fellow cricket fans that our performance is nose-diving. but there are many reasons behind it too. i would blame poor team selection & excessive publicity among many reasons for the nose dive.
air pollution
it is a matter of great concern that the quality of the air of the big cities of our country is deteriorating at an alarming pace. fumes from the industries, vehicular emissions, smoke from the brickfields--all contribute to the degradation of the quality of air. according to a study the amount of lead in dhaka's air is 463 nanograms per cubic meter---the highest in the world. the very smell of the city's air is sickening--to say the least.
august 21 grenade attack
in the latest development, the cid has submitted report to dhaka metropolitan court implicating 22 persons in the gruesome attack. we have known through different media about how fake stories were made public regarding the nefarious attack under the previous political government.
transport issue
mahbubun nabi's article on the subject published in your pages on 14 june is an interesting and pragmatic way to solve dhaka's transport gridlock. more so it is not so capital intensive, can be done phase wise spread over a few years, without a large one time solution. it is indeed a very reasonable approach, which should be a lesson for our city planners and the people at the top. they should read, understand and implement the ideas put forward in the article.
us presidential election
the people of the united states should elect a man as their president who will have the energy and sagacity to deal with the challenges of our times.
future of democracy
i am writing this letter in response to what eminent jurist dr. kamal hossain and convener of the newly formed progressive democratic party (pdp) dr quershi had to say regarding the temporary release of former prime minister sheikh hasina. although i have tremendous level of respect for both of these house-hold names in bangladeshi politics, but it disheartens me to see that none of these leaders see the reality of the situation. democratic presidential candidate barack obama in his book quite rightly put it, when he said that it is very difficult to integrate idealism with realism. it seems to me that his saying can hold true for the statements and comments made by these two eminent politicians. it is sad to see that they have not been able to see the reality of the situation and rather has stuck by their idealistic nature. now let us face the reality, the release of sheikh hasina and also that of begum khaleda zia is needed to ensure that their respective political parties take part in the upcoming elections and also to lend credibility to the election process. simultaneously, we would also like to see the return to democracy in bangladesh. keeping that in mind, i therefore urge our politicians to consider the reality of the situation. the people of this country want a return to democracy which is only possible through a credible, free and fair election.
“ray of hope”
to pave the way for smooth implementation of the election roadmap, the govt is opening up all roads for politicians to participate in the election.
why not free all criminals?
the caretaker government has freed sheikh hasina, seemingly for better treatment abroad. it's fine with us. most likely, it will also let go khaleda zia in the coming days on a similar pretext. that would be fine, too. what is baffling, and perhaps not right, is that our envoys greeted her in london and boston. it sends a wrong signal. here is a nation that accuses its leaders of serious wrongdoings and the next day treats them as vvips! we understand that there may be reasons to make deals with the two ex-prime ministers to secure a safe exit, but this is not the way to go about. we also hear about other measures on the card, such as releasing confiscated properties of politicians serving jail terms, and letting them participate in elections.
bangladesh-myanmar road
it is heartening news that the much-talked about construction of the direct link road from bangladesh up to the national road of myanmar is going to start next year.
construction of road

crusade against corruption
corruption had been a buzzword. it is now widely believed that due to the anti- corruption drive led by the interim govt, corruption has decreased. the government's crusade against corruption has succeeded to a great extent as they nabbed notorious criminals. among the corrupt, many politicians are now languishing in jail.
child labour
an estimated 158 million children aged 5-14 are engaged in child labour - one in every six children in the world. millions of children are engaged in hazardous jobs or conditions, such as working in mines, working with chemicals and pesticides or working with dangerous machinery. they are everywhere but invisible, toiling as domestic servants in homes, labouring behind the walls of workshops, hidden from view in plantations. children living in the poorest households in rural areas are most likely to be engaged in child labour.

a good proposal
recently, there was an article by a professor of buet (?) on the future of dhaka city not being via any of the expensive but ineffective proposals to 'improve' its transport systems but via a government policy to empty the city of many of its inhabitants by moving many government offices to some major provincial centres around the country that should be encouraged to develop a life of their own.
good move, but…
first of all, i would like to thank the higher authorities for taking a wonderful step, that is, the counter-service for all transports. most probably, it has been introduced for the first time in chittagong. it has been introduced for ensuring better passenger service. it was our expectation that we people would enjoy a more comfortable transport service. we want to reach our destinations in due time. at the same time, it will partially stop traffic blockage here & there. but it is an irony that in our country it is very tough to implement the rules & policies.
obama: is he different?
in the primaries “change” is the jingle that obama has stamped in the american mind. his winning the democratic presidential nomination against the impressive hillary rodham clinton, the former first lady, confirms an aspiration to see life differently among many of his countrymen. when the republicans are beset by countless messy affairsboth internal and international, of the bush administration, what could be better for a democratic presidential hopeful than gaining precious electoral currency by pressing for a change? mr. obama is wise enough not to miss it and so finds himself in the position to become the 44th american president. view the page international
