delhi summit a sign of productive bilateralism
on balance, prime minister sheikh hasina's official visit to india can be characterised as an exercise in productive bilateralism. a crucial point here is that the visit, the first for a bangladesh leader in a long number of years, has provided the heads of government of bangladesh and india with the opportunity to engage in summitry to review the ties between the two countries. there is hardly any question that these ties have in recent years often been marked by acrimony generated by a number of issues affecting especially bangladesh. issues such as trade, transit, water-sharing and suspicions on the harbouring of criminal and even terrorist elements in each other's territory have created quite a few barriers in the way of cooperation between the two nations.
the familiar adp implementation pattern
despite the elected government's seriousness early in the day to push adp implementation from the very beginning of the financial year which has been traditionally marked by a long-drawn-out warm-up phase, not much of a momentum has been generated this time in terms of utilisation of development allocations. unfortunately the first six months have seen only 28 percent utilisation of the total adp allocation. resultantly, the government is faced with an impossible task of spending remainder 72 percent of the allocated resources.
looking back at those times
three years ago this month, to the relief of the people of bangladesh, the caretaker cabal led by iajuddin ahmed was pushed from office through a proclamation of emergency. what then transpired was simple historical necessity brought about through the rise of a new administration that quickly went into the business of setting things back in order.

boxers happy at home
the success of bangladesh boxers has been few and far between in the south asian games. they have won only two gold medals in the regional sporting extravaganza and that too on home soil. and this might be a good reason for bangladesh amateur boxing federation to dream of winning gold when the 11th edition of sa games begins here on january 29.

the unsung hero
the idea cup tri-nation was a tournament for mahmudullah riyad to provide a glimpse of how reliable he could be as a batsman for the team. he looked average with his ordinary spin as well as in the late order batting since he made his one-day international debut against sri lanka in colombo in july 2007 and his few sporadic innings could hardly catch the eyes of the fans or the cricket pundits. but with the performances in the tri-nation tournament the stylish cricketer gave an impression that he has improved a lot to cement his place in the team; if it is not as an all-rounder then definitely as a batsman.

one of the key challenges that england will have to confront as they aim to secure a series victory against south africa won't actually come from the home side, but rather the geographical location of the wanderers. the stadium is 6,000 feet above sea level which creates a unique atmosphere -- or lack of it -- for the players.

ship-breaking yard
the ship-breaking yards of chittagong have become death traps for the hapless workers. fatal accidents are very common there. though the owners of the yards earn huge amount of money through this industry, they are indifferent in ensuring security for the workers. despite the recent tragedy, yard workers are compelled to work without gloves, safety costumes, etc. moreover, these ship-breaking yards are a great source of environment pollution. by this time faujdarhat and bhatiary, nearby areas of sitakunda, have become worst affected by pollution. in those areas 21 species of fish have become extinct and some 11 species are on the verge of extinction.
role of media
it has now become apparent that some newspapers work as silent supporters of some political vision and modulate the readers' minds in the direction of the political philosophy of a chosen political party. as a television viewer, one is subjected to the same experience as that of the print media. the media may have a liking for some political philosophy but the problem arises when it becomes blind. the role of print and electronic media is found to serve the purpose of different political parties. they make programmes focusing on the party interest, whereas the media should have guarded the interest of the people without any compromise. the media by their unbiased, pro-people role, through their news, editorials and programmes, can make people aware of their legitimate rights.
good films
in old times watching films was the main source of entertainment for the general people. in those days they used to go to watch movies with whole family to celebrate any event. but with the passage of time the scene had changed and the educated people stopped going to the cinema. because most of the films were full of obscenity.
congratulations!
i am really proud that fazle hasan abed is to be knighted by her majesty queen elizabeth ii. this is a worthy achievement. he is not only the founder of brac but also one of the most influential personalities of our country. he has shown the world his quality only through his work.
pre-primary education
it is a matter of great regret that primary education is in bad shape in our country. in the developed countries the authorities give more emphasis on primary education because it is the foundation of student life. we have learned recently that the present government is going to reshape primary education by setting up more schools, recruiting more teachers, providing tiffin facilities at a cheap cost, giving 100 taka to every student per month, distributing learning materials, etc. and a decision was taken to start pre-primary education within two years. basically, a student cannot cope with the curriculum of class i at an early age of 4 or 5. an orientation is needed at that age. and not every student comes from an educated family.
banning religion-based parties
law minister shafique ahmed's statement that the awami league regime will ban religion-based political parties is unfortunate. i think such a move will create further acrimony and disunity among the people of bangladesh. subsequent political crisis and clashes may claim lives. instead of addressing such touchy and unnecessary issues, the government should work hard with the help of the people of bangladesh to advance our economy and our national standing in the international arena. whenever we step out of our land, our national pride meets disillusionment, as we become aware that our country lags far behind other nations in terms of good educational and political culture and prosperity. perhaps, our standing in international politics is one of the lowest in the world. the political parties that have been in power are largely to blame for this. banning religion-based parties will not give us bread and butter. let us address the pressing issues of poverty, illiteracy, corruption, campus violence and other social and political ills, which have been crippling the nation ever since its birth.
quack doctors, spurious medicines
some days ago we watched in a tv report that some dishonest traders have been supplying adulterated medicines to several pharmaceuticals. we have come to know that there exist not only quack doctors but also fake pharmaceuticals. the present situation seems to be like “all thieves are cousins”.
sea level rise and bangladesh

textbooks
the government has claimed that they have been able to distribute textbooks to all primary and secondary school students in the country. but the reality is different.
high speed train
this refers to a news item published on the 28 december 09 in the daily star about china unveiling world's fastest train link a train travelling at an average speed of 350 km per hour. well, that's china. they have the resources and the willingness to serve the people. what about us, the people of bangladesh? would it be too much to expect high speed train (hst) service from bangladesh railway between dhaka and chittagong? let's try to dream of travelling from dhaka to chittagong in about three hours or so. well, that would not be high speed train, but that of medium speed. by definition, hst in china, japan, some of the asian countries and in europe have a speed of 250 to 300 km per hour or so. in france, it is called train a grande vitesse (tgv) having a speed of 280 km/hr. however, test runs have achieved 400 to 500 km/hr around the world.
dearth of energy resources
the nation is now experiencing shortage of gas, water and electricity in different parts of the country. these problems have become very acute. according to experts, natural gas is depleting at an alarming rate, which requires the government to take the necessary initiative for the future fuel provision. amid these acute crises, we all are expressing apprehensions. we are frequently asking and putting blame on the government for these ordeals. but is it only the government failing to cope with these problems? in fact, the government alone cannot bring any positive change unless there is cooperation and collaboration of its citizens.

i believe, our leaders and eminent personalities have totally forgotten the environment under which the one-eleven take over took place and it was a welcome happening that brought a sigh of relief to the people of this country as a whole. had there been no one-eleven, the masters of election engineering would have staged an election on 22/11 and the pre-fixed election results would have been declared. there could have been street fights if not a civil war between the pro-and-anti election supporters. there would have been loss of lot of lives and properties. the engineered winners would not have lived more than 1 or 2 months and the country would have been in deep chaos and confusion.

bnp and js
i am utterly disappointed by the bnp politicians. they got elected by the people and it is their sacred duty to attend parliamentary sessions to highlight the problems of the people of their elected areas. but instead, they are finding excuses not to attend js sessions. people are unhappy with the attitude of these bnp members of parliament. now they have come up with a 10-point demand in order to return to parliament. this is absurd and ridiculous.
blind supporters
i refer to mr. palash's letter on bnp's policy published on 4 january in your daily and regret to observe that many knowledgeable citizens in bangladesh are yet to get out of the al-bnp syndrome which is harming our beloved country greatly. our daily life revolves around questioning and counter-questioning every thought that is aired and anything and everything has to do for or against these two parties even when dealing with external issues. view the page international
