the bdr killings and some hard questions
tragedy has been part of bengali collective life for as long as we can remember. death by violent means has been a pattern of life, of the end of life that we have known for ages. three million of our compatriots died at the hands of the pakistan army in the year we wrested freedom for this nation. in 1975, in the space of a mere three months, we lost to assassination the entire leadership that had led us through the long, tortuous struggle for liberation. the corpse of bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman lay sprawled on the staircase of his home; and the bodies of nearly his entire family littered the place. and then came the night when the four leaders of the mujibnagar provisional government were gunned down in the putative security of prison.
time for calm
it's only natural that emotions will be high among the army personnel, more so the officers, after the exposure of harrowing stories of brutality inside bdr headquarters. not to be so would be abnormal. with every passing day pictures of barbaric acts by the mutineers are being bared to us. it is difficult to believe that genuine bdr jawans could have carried out the senseless killings. the brutalities have reinforced the suggestion that the rebels were not working on their own.
