congratulations to successful hsc candidate
the results of this year's higher secondary certificate examinations have caused mixed reaction among the students and all others concerned. mixed because the overall pass rate has gone down by 4.42 per cent compared to that of last year as also the number of students scoring gpa-5. however, it must be emphasised that as much as it is important to ensure that the maximum number of candidates qualify it is also equally important to maintain a high quality of education.
new buses on city roads a good idea
the spirit behind the decision to introduce an articulated bus service, or buses with increased passenger capacity, on city routes is understandable. there can be no denying that traffic movement in dhaka has of late acquired horrendous proportions. it will certainly lessen citizens' worries if serious, purposeful moves are made to ease their movement on the roads. however, there is also the truth that a mere introduction of new vehicles on the road will turn out to be quite pointless where facilitating road traffic is concerned. and there are some rather pertinent reasons behind such observations of the traffic situation.

niketon-banani lake

tipaimukh dam
it's unfortunate that despite being reputed as a rather friendly state in the region india is willing to construct the tipaimukh dam, which will severely impact the geographical and ecological landscape of bangladesh. understandably, this project promises multifarious benefits for the indians. however, as their closest neighbour we'll inevitably pay a harsh price for the benefits that they are destined to enjoy. it appears that the indian policy makers lack simple sense of diplomatic ethics that must characterize every state's international policies in this era of globalisation. is it really moral to be obsessed about our own prosperity, when our friends around us will inescapably suffer to ensure that prosperity? does anyone have the right to illuminate his own house by setting his neighbour's house on fire? basic ethics says no.
all-pervasive corruption
lately two phenomena have drawn my attention intensely. one is the government decision of recruiting more than 20,000 primary school teachers which is really commendable as this level of education has been facing shortage of teachers. moreover, primary education has always been given less importance than any other area of government's attention.
test series win!
as a bengali, i am extremely proud of bangladesh's first test as well as series win ( that too by a margin of 2-0) on foreign soil. though the cynics will try their level-best to undermine the brilliant achievement, the defeated west indies team being practically a second eleven, but that is not the fault of bangladesh whose sole aim is to defeat the opposition, irrespective of its composition. this win will provide the much-required boost for the bangladesh team which was constantly criticised by the "pundits" and even questions were raised about their test status. perhaps the know-all brigade is oblivious of the fact that it took as much as 20 years for india to register its first test victory. in contrast, bangladesh has achieved three test wins (and a series also) within nine years of entering the arena. bangladesh's victory over west indies is also a very good advertisement for test cricket which shows that success is not the sole monopoly of a few selected countries only and that a new cricketing power is slowly but steadily emerging from the land of the royal bengal tigers.
