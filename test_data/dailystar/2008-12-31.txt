poll stage-managed, not acceptable: khaleda
bnp chairperson khaleda zia early today said monday's general election was stage-managed and farcical, and so its results are not acceptable to her party.
bnp at lowest ebb
it is a shock-and-awe rout for the bnp, once a mighty party.
al, allies take 262 seats
the awami league-led grand alliance secured 262 seats in monday's 9th jatiya sangsad election outplaying the bnp-led four-party combine that got only 32, according to unofficial results of 299 constituencies available yesterday.
you shall reap as you sow
as we celebrate the majesty of public will and try to understand the stunning results of the national election 2008, the real question that needs to be asked is not why awami league won so comprehensively, but why bnp got the thrashing that it did.
people want to see changes promised
from businessmen to homemakers, the general people now expect that awami league (al) while forming the new government would demonstrate how it would keep its pledge by bringing a 'change.'

five sent to jail

us, japan, hail, india terms polls 'historic'
usa, india and japan have welcomed bangladesh for successful holding of parliamentary elections, which mark the return to democratic process.

the turnout in ninth parliamentary election is the highest ever in the history of bangladesh with little possibility of fake votes having been cast due to the new system with a voter roll that had photographs to confirm one's identity.
yunus greets hasina
nobel laureate prof muhammad yunus yesterday congratulated awami league president and former prime minister sheikh hasina on the party's landslide victory in the ninth parliamentary polls.
women cruise to a historic high

graft, food price throw bnp out
corruption and price of essentials were the major deciding factors for voters going into the just concluded ninth parliamentary election.

after the rather humiliating defeat in monday's parliamentary election, the leadership of bangladesh nationalist party (bnp) is now soul searching to find out the reasons behind it.
observers term polls free, fair
the international republican institute (iri), a washington-based election monitoring body, yesterday said the results of the ninth parliamentary elections held on monday are an accurate reflection of the will of bangladeshi voters.
trial in people's court
it was a quick trial in people's court and the verdict was simple and clear with a message attached to it. it said it is the masses that hold the ultimate power in a republic. and it is they who break down the doors of bastille again and again whenever tyrant rulers and their henchmen make feeble attempts to hide inside. history tells us that the despots have never been forgiven by the people.
public once again proves its might
once again, the bangladeshi voters have demonstrated that it is best to never underestimate them. once again they have delivered a verdict as clinical as it has been mature, and shown that when they are able to exercise their franchise without fear for their safety they are able to render decisive and critical judgments.

out of the past and into the new
as the nation takes a deeper look into how monday's elections went and its historic outcome, we cannot but note some particular features that characterised the polls. voter turnout was a whopping 85 per cent, in the words of the secretary of the election commission, marking an increase of 10 per cent over the last election in 2001. such enthusiastic and spontaneous exercise of the right to franchise is a highwater mark of and a point of pride for democracy anywhere in the world. this is also a fitting tribute to the congeniality of the election atmosphere which encouraged voters to come out in large numbers to cast their ballots. it is to the credit of the ec and the caretaker administration that their constant vigil ensured that goons or any other vigilante groups could not disrupt the voting process.
andamans tragedy
a large body of gullible bangladeshis, around 400, fell easy prey to machinations of fraudulent job brokers setting sail to the sea apparently on way to the malaysian coast, some two months ago. most of them are from chittagong and cox's bazar. this is how their tale of tragedy unfolded: after the ill-fated bangladeshis floated in the sea on six speed boats for some days, their fake employment agent put them on board a ship and abandoned them in the high seas. as they floated listlessly and ran out of water and food, seven of them died while 102 were rescued -- thanks to the indian coast guard. as many as 300 have gone missing and many of them feared to have drowned.
the priorities before sheikh hasina
now that the people of bangladesh have spoken, and spoken loudly, it remains for the incoming government of sheikh hasina to get its priorities right and go about putting them in implementation mode. the electoral triumph of the awami league and its allies in the grand alliance has been on a monumental scale.
keeping her word
at the moment when sheikh hasina, being the leader of grand electoral alliance, stands with congratulations raining down on her, i will take the opportunity to remind her of some thoughts she shared with the writer about one and a half years ago. view the page sports
the fight goes on
mohammad ashraful started with a magnificent cover drive against muttiah muralidaran. that, however, hardly indicated anything as he usually does things this way before frustrating all. but there was a distinct change yesterday in the bangladesh captain's approach that took the first test against sri lanka into the fifth day at the sher-e-bangla national stadium in mirpur.
