women who light candles
my mother was the second of seven children, born in an aristocratic family in murshidabad. she was a married at the age of fourteen and gave birth to her eldest daughter sakina, my oldest sibling, a great woman of piety and patience. having very limited literacy and numeracy, my mother came to live with my father in kolkata, a city very daunting with its levels of intellectual and cultural diversity. my father's ambition of speaking for the minority in india took away many years from his married life and he had to spend those years in jail. my mother was left on her own to cope with the myriad responsibilities of home and the arduous task of bringing up her ten children. she had the additional task of looking after some other children being brought up alongside my siblings. my mother displayed the most amazing calm and dignity during these troubled times. she was brave enough to face people from the intelligence department who came to search our home when my father was in presidency jail. she was the lighthouse in our choppy seas and inculcated in us many a quality of head and heart. as we grey with the weight of advancing years we remember her with the deepest reverence.
slavery in american literature

inquiries into feminist thought
as a critical friend of feminists, i find it enjoyable publicising a non-anti-feminist book on which i could somehow lay my hands. this is fire with fire by naomi wolf, already quite a celebrity for her earlier book, vthe beauty myth . wolf's first book was granted a sort of foremost position in what is called third wave feminism. and it's not at all that the second book is anyway against feminism or its principal causes. here we get started rather with wolf's valorizing account of the famous hill-thomas hearings (anita hill's testimony in the us senate hearings prior to clarence thomas' appointment to the supreme court) that took place in september-october 1991, ushering in “a spontaneous women's uprising that brought american women an incredible number of victories”. and, this, wolf feels, could just be the big beginning for men-women equality. but that did not happen. why? as wolf finds it, an obstacle stood on the path of women's equality in the shape of many american women's rejection of “feminism.” that's how the struggle did not pick up further.
