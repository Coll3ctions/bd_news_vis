elevating women's position
prime minister sheikh hasina has announced her government's resolve on the occasion of the 100th international women's day to repeal all laws discriminatory to women and make a duly updated national women development policy work to change the women's lot in a radical way. it is worthwhile to note that a national women's development policy was formulated by an awami league government itself during 1996-2001 which was thereafter tampered with by the bnp-jamaat alliance government that followed. thus, if we took one step forward we were soon to go two steps backwards.
land grab in cox's bazar
despite all the concerns that have been raised in the recent past about the many instances of illegal land grabbing across the country, the menace appears to have gone on. the impunity with which such activities are resorted to by individuals as well as groups has left the nation amazed at the audacity with which they have indulged in such misdeeds. the bigger concern is the failure of the authorities to put an end to such acts effectively through deterrent punishment being meted out to them. and it is because of such a failure that certain sections of people have continued to grab land that belongs to either the government or individuals.

the truck drivers have done it again; this time, a diplomat of a foreign land, who came to our country as a goodwill ambassador from her beautiful land, and who our govt was duty bound to protect and provide security, has been killed by a truck driver who is "absconding". absconding? do these drivers not have a drivers license? do they not have a voter id? what explanation does the home minister have for such random acts of recklessness on our roads by these murderers in the guise of "truck drivers"? our children are being killed every day on the roads, our citizens are being crushed on the roads on a daily basis by these "truck drivers" but we do not yet see a concerted effort by the elected representatives to bring these drivers to book. where are the owners of these trucks? take them into custody until they turn in the absconder; where is the police? busy taking bribes? now, we hang our heads in shame and apologize to the family of the thai dcm killed in the most tragic manner on our road. the foreign embassies should put out an advisory to their citizens, asking them to refrain from driving on these roads, held hostage by the whim of the "absconding truck drivers". we have joined the ranks of the uncivilized nations; thanks to the truck drivers. and yet, total silence from the authorities. why? we demand to know what the authorities are doing about this murderous rampage on the streets; by the truck drivers.

tender box snatching

our cricket
it is becoming very difficult to correctly diagnose the problem and weaknesses of our cricket. they are so much inconsistent that it is difficult to correctly forecast how bangladesh cricket team will do in a particular match. from my limited exposure and experience of cricket, i find a few major problems like :
everybody knows bangladesh
while i was in thailand first in 1982 many of my acquaintances in bangkok asked me where i hailed from. while i said, 'bangladesh'; most of them could not recognise my country. some ended up guessing it was within india. i now feel happy that even the princes of thailand knows the country and loved to live a few days in a remote part of it.
bnp & al
the dishevelled condition of bnp once again shows what happens to those who do not take lessons from history. the bnp thought power was their perpetual right and they did what they shouldn't have done. they misused both political and administrative power to gain anything and everything they wanted without caring a bit what people who voted them to power would mind. now they are paying in full and many doubt if they will ever regain the position they used to hold even during their first tenure.
students
though we believe that proper education and a good result will enlighten a student's career, but when a result causes the doom of a student's life, then it is pathetic. the students of english department under national university have to leave no stone unturned to get 45%marks in the literature subjects while they get around or more than 70/80% marks in language and compulsory english. so, why are they not given good marks in the literature subjects?
name game
it has become apparent from the deliberations of the honourable prime minister that the name game is in retaliation to opposition's changing of over 200 names. it is a politics of hatred and vendetta. from the zeal and enthusiasm of the people concerned, it appears that the country is sharply divided into two camps.
human resource development
bangladesh is lagging behind in developing its population into human resources even four decades after independence. unstable political system is the basic reason that did not allow the decision makers to make effective decisions in this respect. we have got several education commission reports but recommendations of none have been materialized owing to opposition by pressure groups. we do not require an education policy in such a situation.
matter of concern
the way our two topmost leaders are engaging in brawls and giving lesson to each other is a matter of concern. it is getting worse and worse since 1991. but no one has that greatness to take the first step to stop this name war. it will need a huge amount of money to change the name of the airport and other organisations. it will be continued term by term. who will bear this expenditure?
food processing
as i walk along the kitchen market that is adjacent to the area i live in, i see heaps of vegetables-- tomatoes, cauliflowers, cabbages . this pile of greens has been a very common sight throughout the last two months of winter. in other words, this is the season of vegetables. as the prices of these stuff are moderate, people have their share of these products of winter.
land grabbing by police
we are astounded to see that even the law enforcers have been grabbing others' land using their official capacity. the police superintendent (sp) of bagerhat along with two of his colleagues have reportedly taken possession of 700 bighas of land in gopalganj. they claim that they bought the land in 1996. it is mentionable that they claimed to buy it in 1996 during the previous awami league tenure and never tried to possess it. in 2010, when the awami league is in power once again, he along with two other police officers tried to get its possession!
use of generators
i would like to draw your attention to widespread use of diesel run generators in the residential areas which has added and is adding new sources of air pollution in areas where most people spend most of their time. view the page international
