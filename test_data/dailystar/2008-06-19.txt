bangladeshis abroad
thanks to dr. farid majumdar from germany for his letter “workers in the middle east” in ds on 9 june 2008.i salute him, especially for finding out such important causes of miserable, inhuman and unacceptable condition of our people abroad who earn foreign currency. undoubtedly, we are proud of them because they have to bear with the so called inhuman life in the middle east or other countries to help our land. i think they are priceless diamonds! so we should care about them. the authorities should take adequate steps to solve their problems.
budget
this is for the second consecutive year when we have the budget presented by a caretaker government and under the state of emergency. budget is announced for 12 months and for all the people of the country. i wish to have views of different people regarding the budget. this year we are tired of listening to economic jargons. we want to know about the common people's position in the budget. food security is a burning issue now. is the government well aware of the facts and condition of food production at the grassroots level? we have seen enough effort by the government to handle the price hike situation. how will the government extend subsidies to the farmers and ensure reward for their production?

bangladeshis in bahrain
we have been hearing news pouring in of the plight of bangladeshis in bahrain. many of us have our relatives and friends as engineers, doctors, or teachers who have been residing in bahrain for more than fifteen years. bahrain does not have the expertise that bangladesh has and, therefore, recruits professionals from our country who have contributed immensely to the development of bahrain. what strikes me most are the abuses they are nowadays hurling on our professionals which are against human rights. for example, “you are a bangladeshi. so you are a killer.” the fact is that there are murderers and criminals in every country. the law and order will deal with those lawbreakers. however, if you see a black crow, you cannot assume that all crows are black. once, mr. gaddafi had a sour relationship with the white leadership and he went retorting that all french books must be burnt. the hazards that the innocent bangladeshis are facing now must be handled peacefully and efficiently by the bahrain government. also, our government should extend its helping hand to resolve this problem.

population
population is a great resource to any country like land, oil and gold. there is a misconception that the huge population that we have is a burden but i would like to differ, as i consider manpower as our prime asset. if we can educate a large segment of this population and can employ them by training, then they will never be a burden, rather they will be converted into the biggest asset. and for the development of the country, full participation of women in the economic activities is needed. view the page international
