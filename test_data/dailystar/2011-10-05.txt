disappearing historical relics
the latest instance of utter neglect to invaluable heritage sites consists in the demolition of 368-year old three-domed mughal era mosque with a persian inscription near mitford hospital in old dhaka. although a five-storied mosque will be built in the space, this is hardly any justification for demolishing a historical mosque. the loss to heritage far outweighs the apparent gain from the new structure which could be put up anywhere else. view the page sports

ill-fated jnu students
in your editorial of september 27, 2011 you wondered why protests always took violent form in our country. we, the students of jnu, have been demonstrating for a long time in a civilized manner. but nobody paid any attention. and now we are running out of time as our university turns six (6) on october 20. so, what would the desperate students have done? as a matter of fact, we were protesting in a civilized way till the police and the bcl started to beat up the students. of course, vandalising cars is really a shameful act and every student of jnu feels sorry for this. but was it all our fault? you asked in your editorial what had been the fault of the stranded commuters and of those whose vehicles had been senselessly vandalised? then, we ask you - what was our fault? what will we do if this university goes private? if the government doesn't have enough funds, then why did thepm promise to establish at least one public university in every district? the government can spend around tk. 2000 crore just to change the name of an airport, but can't spend one-tenth of the amount for jnu?
ban on hydraulic horn
i am writing this letter, after reading md. a. alim's letter of 26th september in your columns on hydraulic horn. hydraulic horns are banned by law in our country. but i doubt if there is any implementation of the law. i had a bitter experience while i was returning to dhaka from chuadanga with my wife and two-year-old son after celebrating eid with my family members.
do we really need sitting service buses?
being an inhabitant of mirpur area, i start for my office from pallabi at quarter past seven in the morning and it takes almost an hour to reach shewrapara. the unbearable gridlock, caused by various reasons, is turning out to be a threat to my job. at pallabi, mirpur 10, kazipara and shewrapara the commuters queue up in large numbers to get on the bus every morning. though i am not an expert, yet i have found out some problems where we can work on. the unskilled traffic police is one of the causes behind this jam. they find it difficult to control the movement of the vehicles at every point. and some of the drivers block the roads unnecessarily. most of the bus services in mirpur area offer sitting service. they do not take any more passengers when the bus is full in the morning. as a result, the queues of the commuters seem endless. i think we do not need any sitting service bus at all. all the buses should take passengers standing, with a revised bus fair. stern government action is called for in this respect. do we really need sitting service buses?
corporal punishment
some teachers resort to corporal punishment in schools. they do it to maintain discipline in the classroom. but physical punishment has a negative impact on the mind of the pupils. it leaves a lasting impression on the students' and influences their future conduct. so, it can have a short-term result but it has long term negative effects. that is why, corporal punishment is banned in many countries.

let the corrupt commit suicide
two campaigns in china - the three-anti campaign (1951) and five-anti campaign (1952) - were reform movements originally issued by mao zedong in an effort to rid chinese cities of corruption. the process was effective. some 20,000 cadres and 6,000 trained workers began spying on the business affairs of fellow citizens. the media encouraged compliance with the government policies. up to 15,000 trained propagandists were working in shanghai by late 1951. by february 1952, parades of anti-capitalist activists went door to door to visit business leaders. it created immense psychological pressure. and corruption went down. of course, it had some negative impacts, but every story has two sides to it.
indecent cinema posters
that day while i was returning home from my university, i noticed that some young boys were smilingly watching some obscene bangla cinema posters. our censor board probably consists of some immoral persons who do not find any unpleasant scenes in the films which are produced in fdc.
establish peace at home before world peace
i consider sheikh hasina's presentation of world peace roadmap at the un of little significance, given her failure in bringing peace in her own country . in fact, i do not read in detail any statement made by the ministers, because i know what would they say about a particular incident. while commenting on hartal, they will definitely say that life was completely normal and people rejected the 'unjust hartal' called by the opposition.
the roads of bangladesh
if you are travelling from dhaka to another district, you must know how long it is going to take to reach the destination. but you can never reach there in time. why? we mostly think that the jam on the roads is to blame. but besides that, we should also take a good look at the roads. most of them are broken or damaged, with holes filled with puddles or mud. here in uttara, some organisations dug a road to set up some pipes a few months ago. they set up the pipes, filled the holes with mud, and left the rest of the road broken. my school is only 510 minutes away from my home. as i go by car, it must take no more than five minutes on an average. now, it takes 1015 minutes because of the road condition. it's time the authorities took some action.
why this agitation?
a public university should be run by the government. the students of jagannath university have been demonstrating against the university act 27(4) since its establishment in 2005. but the government has failed to give any solution to the problem. the students' opinion is that if a university is run by the students' fees, then it cannot be called a public university. so, their demands are simple - to nullify the university act and to have government funding for the university.
