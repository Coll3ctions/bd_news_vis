celebrating eid-ul-azha
eid-ul-azha, the second biggest religious festival of the muslims, will be celebrated tomorrow. prayers will be offered for world peace as well as prosperity of mankind. that's indeed one of the most remarkable aspects of any muslim festival -- divine blessings are sought and the solemnity of the occasion maintained in a joyous mood. eid-ul-azha revives the memory of prophet ibrahim's (pbuh) faith in allah and his complete readiness to sacrifice his dearest son as a token of surrendering himself to the divine wishes. that's where lies the message of eid-ul-azha. the almighty, in his infinite kindness and being satisfied with the prophet's resolve, finally withdrew the decree and permitted him to sacrifice an animal. so, it was much more than an act of sacrificing an animal -- a triumph of belief in the almighty's endless beneficence over any earthly possession.
