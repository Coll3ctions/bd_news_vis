dhaka-chittagong highway
the cancellation of a project related to an upgrading of the dhaka-chittagong highway into a four-lane road for the second time in fifteen months is proof of how bureaucracy often stymies development. the ministry of communications and the roads and highways department, unable to see eye to eye on the matter, have now together created a situation where the issue of a tender has effectively put a stop to the upgradation plan, at least for now. that is indeed most sordid business. and it becomes pathetic when a whole plan falters around the question of a so-called performance guarantee being shortened from 28 days to seven days. at this point, there is a clear picture of how officials are blaming one another over the issue, with the ministry claiming that the time slash was a gross violation of the public procurement regulation (ppr) 2008.
felling trees yet once more
trees certainly do not figure prominently in the dhaka city corporation's scheme of a healthy urban setting. a large number of trees were cut down for no good reason in the past and the latest plan of eliminating 52 old trees from the city's gulshan area is a shocking reminder of the city fathers' insensitivity to the need for retaining the trees and all green patches in the metropolis. of course, the dcc has by now stepped back from its plan in the face of a vigorous protest from environmental groups. but the question remains: why must it bring itself to a pass where public resistance compels it to abandon a project that everyone knows is a bad one in the first place?

whether politics is guided by morals or not is a moot point. but india has proved that democracy knows no morals. we have fiercely flaunted before the world, particularly our neighbours, oscillating between dictatorship and democracy of sorts, that we have the democratic system in position. but when the time came to prove it, we were found wanting. it is not only the congress and the bjp which fell from the minimum standards of integrity. all political parties, including the left, played an opportunistic game.
elections: why and why not
election fever, if i am allowed to say so, is gradually gaining momentum. quite contrary to the usual practice the process of the general election follows the one for the local government elections across the country. at the first instance, we have by now election schedule declared for a number of municipal and city corporations. submission of nomination papers, their scrutiny, acceptance and rejection have already been completed. though yet to take off formally and on a mass scale individual aspirants and their supporters are about to mobilize their respective numerical strength to fall back upon. all their enthusiasm would obviously depend much on their respective party support. view the page sports

when a relative doesn't eat enough
good nutrition is critical to senior health, but many older adults do not eat right. older people are more likely to have inadequate nutrition than younger adults are — and are more susceptible to numerous health problems related to an inadequate diet. many older adults in long term care facilities have poor nutrition. while seniors cared for at home or living independently generally fare better, patterns leading to inadequate nutrition — also called malnutrition — often begin at home. knowing the causes and danger signs of nutrition problems, as well as taking steps to ensure a diet rich in protein and other necessary nutrients, is critical in maintaining senior health and strength.

religious terrorism and bangladesh
a bangladeshi journalist working for a foreign radio station warned me recently against being complacent about islamic fundamentalists in bangladesh. i argued that despite its overwhelming muslim population, bangladesh has historically rejected political parties that have used islam in elections. jamaat-e-islami, the best known among such parties, has never won even a handful of seats in elections, achieving the best of 14 seats in the 2001 elections as a result of its alliance with the bnp. i also argued that despite being predominantly muslim, bangladesh is the most liberal south asian country where islam has been influenced by sufism with the least incidence of communal violence that are so endemic in other parts of this sub-continent.
