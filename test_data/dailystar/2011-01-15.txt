businessmen taking police to task
the worries expressed by leading members of the business community about the wrongs committed by the police have long been the concern of the general public. now that the business leaders have informed police officials at a meeting arranged by the federation of bangladesh chambers of commerce and industry on thursday of such realities, one expects the authorities to take corrective action. by any measure, the criticism leveled at the police by the business leaders is severe. it is also unprecedented because rarely has as significant a body as the fbcci come down so hard on the failings of the police and that too in the presence of the minister of state for home and senior police officials. of course, the minister of state and police officers have tried reassuring the business community by suggesting that the police are not the enemies of the people. they are not, to be sure. but for the people to feel confident about getting the services they require from the police will call for a major change in attitude on the part of the police, all the way from the bottom to the highest perches of the organization.
death in workplace
the figure of deaths of workers in workplace is a horrendous commentary on the importance employers attach to the wellbeing of their employees, particularly those working in factories and construction sites. last year, the death toll stood at 383 in as many as 270 places of work, quite an increase from 265 the year before. for the statistics we have to be thankful to safety and rights society, an ngo working for the rights and safety of workers. and we would like to agree with the ngo that, given that many deaths of workers do not get reported at all, this perhaps is a very conservative figure. view the page sports

two decades of the daily star
razzak
english newspapers in bangladesh are playing a significant role in providing information just as their bangla counterparts. the daily star has been a lead player in our media. i've noticed that youngsters follow the newspaper. best wishes on this joyous occasion and i hope the daily star continues its journey on the right track. i do have another observation -- there are only a few reports published on mainstream bangladeshi movies. i hope the authorities concerned will bring their attention to this issue. however, a makeup artiste has informed me that the daily published an in depth article on him, which is very positive. there are many others in the movie industry who always remain behind the scene. if the daily star focuses on their stories, i will be very happy.

my father's autobiography
(continued from last week)
the other person of whom i got to know more than i knew before is my kakku, my uncle, my father's only sibling. kakku's life was no less agonizing than my father's. if attempted, i am sure a more poignant and grievous book would come out from the chronicles of his life. however, my father's book doesn't say much of him as he was not staying with his brother most of the time. as mentioned earlier he was first in the hostel and then later at a cousin's place in mymensingh. he used to come to see his family but after long intervals. but whenever he came he duly played his role as the eldest son and brother in the family. instead of letting know his mother of the hardships of living in a hos-tel he always assured his mother of his well being. before leaving he used to urge dadi not to worry and give her high hopes for the future and give lots of advices to his young brother. the other aspect of kakku that is learned from the book is his responsible and sincere approach towards education. we always had seen him as being strict about our studies and wondered what caused it. but the book proves that his seriousness was more inborn than acquired. my father remembers the times when kakku used to study in the primary school of the village long before going to the hos-tel. at an age when kids are more into games and fun kakku was more concerned about his studies than playing. he used to reach school much before everyone and if for some reason he had missed going there before the first bell rang no one could convince him to go to school on that day. an interesting example in the book of his attentiveness would be when once his bara mama came and decided to take everyone for a visit to his sister's place in another village. on the night before the journey suddenly late at night kakku started to read his lessons loudly baffling all at home. when asked about the reason for this earnest reading kakku answered that he was preparing his lessons in advance as he wouldn't be able to do so in the following days of his visit. i highly respect kakku for his discipline and sense of responsibility and believe these are the qualities that have made him and my father achieve success in life. and i am proud to say that they have also instilled in us their principles.
konedine ashiben bondhu
what do you say about a man who deeply loved tagore, who loved music and had a way of enriching the life of every person that he was in contact with? that professor bazlul mobin chowdhury was a complete human being, never saw the dark side in anyone, always illuminated the place he went to with his brilliant smile and exquisite manners. that too was unintentional; he wanted to remain in the background. he once confided to me, “i am happy with the role of a prompter, which i once had.” 'what does that mean?' i asked he said that was the closest he had ever gotten to acting!
why i write poetry
i try to write poetry. 'try' in the sense that over the last forty years i have gained some experience in understanding poetry. i am fairly familiar with the clichés of the alley of poetry. i have been familiar with the words, symbols and metaphors. i have grown a tongue that can taste poetry. it is imperative for those who write poetry that they know these matters up close. i have gradually understood when i should write with the heart, and when with the brain. thus immaturity grows up to maturity. now i think i am fairly mature enough to understand poetry. through observation, i have learned what kind of poems can earn popularity and what kind of poems are written to fill the spaces of newspapers. view the page star health

the world in its many dimensions
wali-ur rahman has been a distinctively different breed of diplomat. for one thing, he has suffered for his political convictions and has seen a vindictive government show him the door for those convictions. for quite another, he has consistently made it a point to come forth with his commentaries on a wide range of subjects. unlike other retired civil servants, who have generally found it convenient to write on the subjects they have dealt with as part of the civil service or have decided to go for an expression of views on politics, rahman has opted for a widening of the sphere, his sphere. transition to democracy is proof of the exhaustive view rahman takes of the world around him. and that, of course, comes through the combination of aesthetics, politics and diplomacy he presents in this work. on the face of it, the book is a compendium of articles he has written for national newspapers over the years. in real terms, it is a good feast he has on offer through bringing before the reader a variety of subjects and themes that the latter can surely mull over.
a quietly charged tale
human life can turn tragic corners without any notice and yet leave traces on the cycle of eternity, leave stigma that refuses to go away. nicky dillon and her father stumble upon a new born baby left in the snow in the woods. they take the baby to the nearby hospital and save the infant. however, the hospital authority notifies the police and the inquiries begin. from this moment nicky and her father's lives change and overnight they become the hot news of new hampshire, the place where they live.
images and themes that make your day
the agrahayan 1417 issue of uttoradhikar, the monthly literary journal of the bangla academy, surely upholds the richness of the enterprise. in the earlier issues of uttoradhikar, conscious presentations of the various aspects of bangla literature as well as other areas of aesthetics were a palpable sign of the quality it had begun to aim for. the journal now comes with a profundity that should be noted by readers. in the issue under review, it is an enlightening write-up on khan sarwar murshed, the distinguished academic and scholar, which draws attention. abdus shakur travels through an entirety of the murshid landscape and offers up to the reader a pretty comprehensive account of professor murshid's life and times. reading the article is for many who have had the good fortune of being tutored by scholars in the mould of khan sarwar murshid a swift going back to nostalgia.
