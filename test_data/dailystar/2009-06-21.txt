mps being exceedingly empowered
it's all in the government's mind. it makes a plan for giving block-allocations directly to mps for development activities and then pulls back. the lawmakers are now being given the authority to prepare development projects for their constituencies which would be implemented by the lgrd ministry. to the extent that the funds are channeled to the ministry instead of giving these on a platter to individual mps, it sounds positive. but just. the question is: why these funds couldn't be placed to the elected local bodies themselves with provisions for oversight by the lgrd ministry or the relevant parliamentary committees, if devolution of authority, as envisaged in the constitution, had to be respected?

in pursuit of middle-income status
in 1997 the author wrote as follows: "we cannot lift ourselves to switzerland, japan or usa's income level in near future. the more relevant point is that we do not need to make any such effort at this stage. what is really needed for us at this stage is to cross the threshold income of say $600 or $700 so that we can meet the basic needs of our people. countries develop a decent level of respectability once they cross this threshold income. they generate a self-sustaining momentum that keeps the income growing at a high pace." ( the independent , may 1, 1997).

israeli settlements and palestinians
israeli pm netanyahu argues that the expansion of settlements in the occupied west bank is needed to accommodate the natural growth of population in israel. this kind of argument is not expected from the head of a government! because, this would mean allowing a country to attack and annex a portion of a neighbouring country if it is militarily possible. therefore, this kind of argument must be condemned by all.
high-rise buildings
the tiny bangladesh's density of population is one of the highest in the world. moreover, its agricultural land is shrinking every year. various development works and construction of houses are eating up the lands. but we cannot give up the development work, and to have a shelter for every individual is a basic human right. actually, the housing problem is very acute throughout the country, particularly in the cities and towns. in the past people had houses with ponds, gardens, orchards etc. now the practical situation compels us to live in very small houses or flats. the culture of living in flats in a big building with many new neighbours is not very old but there is no alternative to it in the cities. in fact, we need thousands of 20 or higher storied buildings to fulfil the needs of people. many a man has wrong concept regarding high rising buildings. applying the technique of modern science, it is possible to accommodate thousands of people or offices in one building. bangladesh is in need of more and more big buildings. dhaka, chittagong and other divisional cities should have all 20 or above storied buildings to fight the present and forthcoming crisis.
media and rivers
i have no language to express my appreciation of the courageous role played by the daily star and channel i in sensitising the people, civil society and finally the government about the consequences of encroachment on rivers and pollution of water. the powerful people have been grabbing rivers and dumping industrial effluents in them for a long time not only in dhaka but also all over the country. this has been happening right under the nose of the government and civil society. occasional newspaper and tv reports have failed to produce any tangible result. this time the daily star and channel i have stubbornly pursued the matter and demonstrated the power of the media particularly in mobilizing people's support and compelling the government to listen to a right cause. they have successfully brought together the ministers, parliament members, civil society, and celebrities to compel the government to commit itself to taking action and making necessary laws. the government has already gone into action and we are eagerly waiting to see how much they do to live up to their commitments.
war against muslims
during the bush regime words like insurgency, fundamentalism and extremism were often used to malign the muslims. the words have been used against the muslims deviating from their exact meaning. these words were used by the bush administration and his cohorts solely to undermine the muslim people as being indifferent to the exact time and situation. they deliberately resort to misleading use of these critical words.
president obama
it is amazing and unbelievable that a person could be loved, honoured, looked upon with reverence, irrespective of religion, race and culture. it is my belief that no one else has ever been revered so much like that person--barack obama, the president of the united states.
why this suffering?
do the finance ministry high ups ever visit the jatiyo sanchoy bureau offices in dhaka? if not i would request them to do so early to see for themselves the sufferings imposed on their customers by a “government for the people” service organisation. the office i suggest them to visit is bazme quederia complex, jatiyo sanchoy bureau, in katabon, dhanmondi.
politics and religion
recently, our law minister said that by scrapping the fifth amendment in our constitution, religion-based parties will be banned from politics. well, i am entirely against imposing an all-out ban on such parties. islam is a religion that caters to all aspects of human life including political life. the political ideology preached by islam is 'caliphate'. prophet muhammad (pbuh) was not a mere prophet but was also the head of the first islamic state (medina) which he governed according to sharia laws. after him, this legacy was carried forward by the four caliphs. those were the golden years for muslims and no non-muslim can say that it was a reign of terror for them. if some political parties believe in such ideology then it is illogical to ban them. our constitution is a democratic one which gives every individual the right to preach and practice his/her religious as well as political beliefs independently. by banning religion-based parties, the very spirit of our constitution will be contravened since they will be deprived of preaching and practicing the political ideology they believe in. such parties therefore shouldn't be banned and it is ultimately up to the general public to decide if they should be voted to power or not. i am against such political parties which use religion as a tool to hoodwink people and grab power but not to practice the teachings of islam sincerely. i don't mind if the government bans parties which advocate establishment of an islamic state by bombing people.
journalism
it is the basic principle of journalism that the reporters should not report any criminal or civil matter which is awaiting judicial decision in a partial manner. the reporters should be applauded for their courageous reporting but they should also take care not to report any criminal or civil law related matter in a biased manner.
guardians left out!
after the tragic incident in bdr hq, the schools inside reopened last month. as security measures, the guardians of the students of rifles' school and public school have been barred from entering into the bdr premises since then. as usual, there are many guardians, especially the mothers remaining around until their children finish classes and get out of the schools. these guardians mostly do not have the luxury of having cars or their houses are far off the schools. so they are actually compelled to remain there for 4-5 hours. the bdr administration was sensible enough to erect a shamiyana in front of bdr gate- 4 near jigatola so that the women guardians do have some sort of comfort . but after some days the shamiya collapsed in inclement weather and it was never reinstalled. the school timing is such that nearby shopping complex remains closed and there are no other places to take a sit around. the guardians applied to the bdr administration some weeks ago depicting their misery under the scorching sun or during rainy days. but nothing has been done so far.
plots for mps
it is disgusting to see the moral bankruptcy of our elected representatives. it appears they wanted to be elected to grab everything while in power. my observation is based on the recent remarks of the state minister for housing that the mps would be allotted rajuk plots.
poor performance
here we go again. a team full of hope, a team backed by millions of fans, and a team which loses 99% of the games! that's right, i am talking about the bangladesh cricket team. i have been an avid supporter and fan of our team ever since i can remember. what glorious days ! we weren't labelled as "giant killers" so every time we won, it felt great. then came the day bangladesh got the odi and test status. even the smallest road in bangladesh was transformed into a canvas as we celebrated our presence in world cricket.
vitamin-a
it was with great concern that i read the reports of the death of some children, and of others getting ill, following the recent administration of vitamin a capsules and de-worming tablets.
smart grid
the ap report from washington on the subject, published by a local english daily on 8 june is of interest to the power sector in bangladesh. it should provoke our planners in the power sector (particularly the power ministry). but will they even go through it and try to understand its impact? possibly not, as they are too busy pulling and pushing files and filling note-sheets!
paper tigers!
losing to india is not unexpected. indians are now in their best form. but losing to ireland, where a handful of assorted amateurs just got together, was a big shock. ashraful played even worse than a novice. he got a life and sacrificed it in the same manner. shakib could wait for two more balls when johnston would finish his spell. cricket is not only a game of strokes it is also a game of brain and mind. the whole team needs a psychological check up and counselling.
beware of bureaucracy!
i would like to express my heartfelt thanks to mr. md. anwarul kabir for his article entitled, “beware of bureaucracy!” published in the daily star. i totally agree with mr. kabir. bureaucrats must change their colonial attitude. to bring a real change in the country, our bureaucratic system must be reformed to have a pro-people bureaucracy the government should immediately chalk out a proper policy. view the page international
