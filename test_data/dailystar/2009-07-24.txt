al council session today
the national council of the awami league, meeting in session today, is from many perspectives an encouraging happening. in the sixty years since its birth in 1949, the party has weathered many storms and defied many predictions to turn itself into a large, deep-rooted political organization in pre and post-1971 bangladesh. indeed, it is to the credit of the party that it played a leading role in transforming the political destiny of bengalis through its spirited defence of their rights and eventually providing the nation with the leadership that would steer it to freedom. at this point of time, therefore, one recalls the strong political traditions that have been set through the role of the awami league and the evolution it brought about in the public perception of politics as the art of the possible and the enlightening.

bringing a smile to bengal's muslims
the most communal punishment you can inflict upon any community is to deny it an education. ignorance is the other face of poverty. no one is illiterate by choice. which child would bleed her fingers rolling a beedi in preference to a classroom? view the page sports
our time will come
for a few fleeting hours in grenada, captain shakib al hasan may well have been the doppelganger of captain jack sparrow, the charismatic, happy-go-lucky pirate from the disney movie. impetuous, sharp and overall just scratch-your-head-pump-your-fist brilliant, shakib revelled in the role of captain and truly established himself as the pirate of the caribbean.

bangladesh bank's job?
i fully agree with dse's view regarding bangladesh bank's recent move of 'controlling' the stock market. it has other jobs to do and there is the sec to look after these issues. on what authority could the bank intervene even if we agree that there was manipulation in share trading.

return of the natives
it is widely acknowledged that when btv was the sole tv channel in bangladesh during the 1970's, the plays that would be broadcast once or twice a week were extremely popular and eagerly anticipated by viewers. some would go so far as to maintain that tv drama in bangladesh reached its apotheosis during the black and white decades of the 70's and 80's. indeed, if anyone had predicted channel surfing through the welter of mega serials and ubiquity of commercial breaks in tv now, that individual would have been unceremoniously consigned and confined to a padded cell!

why are some bangladeshis anti-indian?
even if one likes the indian cricket team, he or she would be afraid to express that aloud in the presence of a room full of bangladeshis because there will be several for whom it would be too much to take. however admiring individual indians like vidya balan or a.r. rahman is okay. but collectively anything indian is bad in the opinion of a considerable section of bangladeshis. my recollections are drawn from the days long before the tipaimuk controversy. how can we account for the widespread anti-indian sentiment in bangladesh?
