the business of human trafficking

a crisis of confidence
the element of uncertainty which has been a feature of pakistan’s politics since its general elections on 18 february persists, in a number of ways. that has, of course, little to do with the regime of general pervez musharraf, who has already called the newly elected national assembly into session. so far the president has given little cause for anyone to doubt his intentions, even if the election results have not been to his advantage. the problem, though, comes from within the pakistan people’s party. as the single largest winner of seats, though not an outright majority, the party is poised to form the next government in alliance with the pakistan muslim league of nawaz sharif. improbable as the alliance between these old rivals may seem, the fact remains that in the circumstances it is the only credible option before the politicians opposed to president musharraf.

price hike and people
i was travelling by bus on 24.2.08. the bus was overcrowded. after coping with the initial hassle i started minding to the talks around me. i heard a loud voice, some time choked, of seemingly an old man. his voice overpowered all the sounds and noises around us. he was speaking as if the people, whom he holds responsible for his suffering are just in front of him. his main grievance was against the price hike of essential commodities due to which it was difficult for him to survive with his family. he was straight in saying "set aside the future goods, what we do with future goods if we do not survive at present."
crop biotechnology
agriculture is the largest contributor of the economies of many developing countries, generating more than half of the annual gdp. fifty percent of the world's poorest people are small and resource-poor farmers, and another 20% are the rural landless dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods. it is unfortunate but true that we live in such a world where one amongst every six persons, in the developing world, has no access to food and 2.8 billion people live on less thanus$2 per day. at the world food summit, 186 countries pledged a reduction by half in the number of undernourished people by 2015. combating poverty involves actions to increase food security and per capita income. increasing income of small and poor farmers contributes directly to the poverty alleviation of a large majority of the world's poorest people. science and technology are globally recognised as the drivers of increased wealth and continuously improving standard of living. agribiotech comprises a wide range of biological discipline, offers enormous potential to speed up the development of plant varieties with pro-poor traits such as drought tolerance, higher yields, increased nutritional value among others. biotech/gm crops can play a great role to alleviate global poverty. in the usa, farm income gain from biotech crops(ht soybean, bt potato, bt maize etc.) is $15.9 billion. biotech cotton has already made a significant contribution to the income of poor farmers in the first decade(1996-2005),and this can be enhanced significantly in the second decade. india has already adopted biotech crops and is benefited a lot. india's cotton areas represents 25% of the global area of cotton but the indigenous cotton yields were some of the lowest in the world. it was in 2002 when india adopted bt cotton(a biotech crop) for the first time and became the leading cotton growing country of the world in 2007.approximately 3.8 million small and resource-poor farmers planted bt cotton. china has been also benefited hugely by producing biotech crops like bt cotton, biotech rice.
open letter to chief adviser
it was a great pleasure to be present at the nrb conference in dhaka in december 2007, and listen to your usual thoughtful speech! sir, i am writing to you in response to your suggestion to the nrbs, to send you emails with our personal views and suggestions.
hasina's medical treatment
i appreciate mr, rashed suhrawardy for writing a column entitled “hasina should be allowed medical treatment abroad immediately” in the daily star on 18th february, 2008. i do also agree with him on the point that sheikh hasina should be allowed medical treatment abroad immediately. this is not because hasina was the prime minister of bangladesh that she should be allowed to go abroad for her treatment. but the point is that “a nine member medical team after examining the detained former prime minister at square hospital in the city made three recommendations including sending hasina to the united states for treatment of her hearing problems”. dr syed modasser ali, hasina's personal physician and also a member of the medical team that conducted her check-up at the square hospital said that she needs treatment of her ears in the united states. “ her hearing could be permanently impaired if she is not given treatment immediately. she needs treatment in the us where she received ear treatment earlier”, said dr modasser.
bangladeshis abroad
bangladeshi students are studying in many countries in the world including developed countries like the usa, uk australia, france and some middle eastern countries. we are proud that our boys and girls living abroad are doing well in their studies, which have been reflected in their results. i feel that bangladeshi students are very serious in their studies, they have to do well because of the fact that they are from a poor ad underdeveloped country like bangladesh. i have got two granddaughters living in sydney, australia who were born and brought up there. they are studying in standards xii and vi and by the grace of the almighty both of them are doing well in their studies. apart from schooling they are also equally good in cultural activities and received a good number of trophies. this has become possible mainly due to proper supervision of their parents, that is, my daughter and son-in-law, a senior engineer working in rta nsw.
international mother language day
from the holy koran we come to know that the most merciful allah has bestowed a mother tongue upon each and every caste, creed and colour. mother tongue is so important that the people of a country express their ideas, thoughts, feelings, emotions etc. clearly through mother tongue. but it is an irony of fate that the then rulers tried to impose urdu as mother tongue upon us, instead of bangla. but the valiant sons of our country laid down their lives for our mother tongue, bangla. since then, the day is observed as shaheed day commemorating the sacrifice of the language martyrs. but since 2000, this day has been recognised by the uno as “the international mother language day.”
soul searching
i want to discuss here the philosophical idea, "know thyself." because it is an important subject and related with perfect lifestyle. have you ever thought about?
overbridge needed
although many of the overbridges at different points in dhaka city are not always used, indispensability of the same at certain places needs no emphasis. such a bridge is badly needed near the country's biggest heart hospital (nicvd) alongside the suhrawardy hospital, before which run two divides of mirpur road and through which run speedy vehicles, from dawn to dusk, causing risks and hazards to hundreds of patients and their relatives.
discrepancies!
what a great nation we are! we leave all the expensive granite and marble stones for our bathrooms, hotel floors and staircases and use only bricks, mortar, concrete or unglazed terracotta blocks for building our national monuments such as the liberation war memorial or the shaheed minar!! we celebrate bhasa shaheed dibash on a day of the year with lots of pomp and grandeur, and send our children to english medium schools for the remaining days. are we afraid that a granite monument may last forever outliving the life of this nation? are we afraid that our children when they grow up may remain unemployed if they go to bangla medium schools?
cricket and tourism
growing popularity of cricket in bangladesh can reshape its tourism and hospitality industry. cricket and style go together, so should the cricket fans and their tours. that cricket boosts tourism can be seen from the instances of the west indies, dubai, sharjah and india. the west indies is the archetype for tourism development through cricket. they have been marketing tourism through cricket since the first world cup held in 1975. sharjah , india, australia, south africa and sri lanka, all attract more tourists since they emerged as well known cricket venues.
leaders of the past
the present nation-state era was preceded by imperialism and before that feudalism etc. there is no point in maligning the national leaders of the past. each of the nationalist movement was based on existing socio-economic issues of a particular place or a region.
precision in use of language
the correct use of one's mother tongue is one of the small pleasures of life. i agree in principle with the musing of syed badrul ahsan (ds, feb 6). it is like a good cup of tea, [note the rise of our tommy miah] prepared the way you like it. view the page international
