h1. A really quick example of getting geoJSON to display using D3

This repo is part of the "From Shapefile to geoJSON":http://vallandingham.me/shapefile_to_geojson.html post. 

h2. About

Check out @coffee/vis.coffee@ for the implementation.

Also, this example has been reworked with a JavaScript only version in @js/vis.js@.

Pick your poison!

h2. Running

You can start up a local webserver by using python's simple server:

<pre>
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000
</pre>


or @thin@ in ruby

<pre>
thin start
# might have to run 'bundle install' first
</pre>

Now go to "http://0.0.0.0:3000":http://0.0.0.0:3000/

and you have a basic visualization

OR - I've been using node's http-server as of late, which works just as well.

You need to have it installed:

<pre>
npm install -g http-server
</pre>

Then you just run http-server in the root directory of your site:

<pre>
http-server ./
</pre>

Now go to "http://0.0.0.0:8080":http://0.0.0.0:8080/

h2. Inspiration

As detailed in the "post":http://vallandingham.me/shapefile_to_geojson.html, most of this code comes from "Bostock's Choropleth Example":http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060606 . 

Automatically figuring out the boundaries and scale of the projection comes from "another Bostock example":http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4707858 .
