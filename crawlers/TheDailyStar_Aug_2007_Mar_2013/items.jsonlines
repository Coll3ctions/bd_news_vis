With extreme land scarcity and rising landlessness, rural Asia should normally be reeling under pervasive poverty. But empirical evidence does not seem to lend support to the prevailing pessimism. ", "As a result of triggered growth and transformation, the incidence of people living in poverty has fallen from more than 50% in the mid-seventies to 18% in 2004, and the incidence of hunger has almost halved from more than 30% to 16%. If the current trend continues, as foreseen by researchers, it will create a dramatically transformed Asia contributing roughly to 42% of global GDP by 2015. In fact, Asia will have tremendous influence on world agriculture soon.", "Should Asians then celebrate the outcome? To answer to that, recently, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) jointly organised a high-level policy forum on: \"Agricultural and Rural Development for Reducing Poverty and Hunger in Asia: In Pursuit of Inclusive and Sustainable Growth.\" We present below some observations from that forum.", "Developments and drivers", "Agriculture is depicted as the driver of growth and poverty reduction -- nay, the linchpin of rural livelihoods in Asia. The classic example of this comes from China and India (even Bangladesh) witnessing the largest reduction in poverty in tandem with highest growth in agricultural income. ", "However, in South Asia, agricultural growth was driven more by productivity gains -- a result of the green revolution, science and technology. In other places (e.g. China), policy reforms played the pivotal role, although the early inducement to increased income came from the green revolution effects. ", "Either way, increased agricultural growth and income helped in four principal ways: children's education for more remunerative jobs, migration, and pursuance of non-farming activities. ", "Non-farming activities account for more than half of the rural household income. Engagement of poor households in rural trade, transport, services, remittances, and small-scale manufacturing helped in poverty reduction. Finally, the falling prices of staple grains increased real income of the poor segments to positively affect their exchange entitlements of food. ", "Besides, public investment in rural areas augmented agricultural growth and rural poverty reduction. Spending on research and development (R&D) paid the highest premium, followed by that on roads and education. These had more impact on poverty reduction than the spending on anti-poverty programs -- fraught with inefficiency in targeting and misuse of funds. ", "Asia's agonies", "But, all that glitters is not gold for some who lie far away from the poverty fence. The rate of progress was neither uniform nor inclusive across Asia. There are ample examples on this score, but we bring only a few to the fore. ", "As Akhter U.Ahmed and others of IFPRI note: in 1990, about half of Asia's poor lived in South Asia, 40% in East Asia, 9% in Southeast Asia, and only 0.3% in Middle East and Central Asia. Today, almost three-quarters of the poor live in South Asia, 21% in East Asia, and 5% in Southeast Asia. ", "There are, in fact, many \"Asias\" today, with East and Southeast Asia leading and South Asia lagging behind. More painfully perhaps, those lying near the poverty line performed far better than those far down the line. That is, growth in rural areas failed to grip the poorest of the poor, embracing mostly landless and illiterate households with high dependency ratio. No less disappointing is the growing inequality among rural-rural and rural-urban households. ", "Another syndrome is the non-inclusive character of the growth process itself -- imposing an adverse impact through different channels. For example, in India, half of the poor are found in just three states, and the most disadvantageous regions often suffer from poor agro-ecological conditions and limited market access; there are the \"walking poor\" who remain too far away from modern transport or roads to sell goods or access health and education services. ", "Again, while rural Asia marched forward some sections of the population faced marginalisation. Consider the caste system in India, which excludes the scheduled castes from reaping the rewards of the resurgence in rural areas. In Bangladesh and India, the tribal people are trailing far behind. So is the case in mountainous regions in Southeast Asia (as in Vietnam and Laos). Admittedly, government policies are afoot in these countries to mitigate the miseries of the \"minorities,\" but they are not powerful enough to make a dent. ", "What about women -- the other half of the glass? In some areas, NGOs and government initiatives attempted to empower poor women economically and socially, but it still seems to be a dream. In many countries, women continue to be treated as \"bread eaters\" (not as \"bread winners\") despite the fact that, given equal opportunities and access to resources as men, they are no less efficient as their counterparts. On an empirical plane, economic growth and nutritional status of children have been positively related to the improvement of the position of women in the household. But woes await women due to socio-economic and cultural constraints in many Asian rural setting.", "Non-inclusion also comes from the missing voices of the poor, and adds to their vulnerability and powerlessness. Voicelessness deprives them of the power to influence decisions affecting their lives, negotiate better terms of trade, interact on equal terms with generally stronger market intermediaries, and make governmental and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) accountable to them.", "In pursuit of inclusive growth", "By and large, rural Asia could fare better had the growth been inclusive, and it is not that the excluded ones lost access and entitlements individually or collectively. Worse to come, the economies of this region substantially suffered due to lower national output and hence lower standard of living of its population. Growth could become burdensome if not backed by proper distribution. Non-inclusiveness also bred political tensions and ignited political instability in the region. ", "Therefore, celebration is not the cup of tea for Asian policy makers who will have to grapple with burdensome growth even more in the future. To arrest that, the pathways out of rural poverty should have the following attributes: the poor should have access to the growth-path, pathways should be sustainable economically, politically, and environmentally, and stability (political and macro-economic), especially less volatility, in rice prices."], "tag": ["OP-ED"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=868", "location": null, "date": "2007-08-21"}

", "A leader in Awami League, for example, becomes prominent only if he/she can oppose and attack his/her rival political parties, and vice-versa. The more bitterly he/she can manage to oppose or attack his/her political rivals, the better political career he/she makes. Though opposition is apparent in most democratic societies, the kind of opposition and bitter rivalry developed in Bangladesh politics is absolutely unpalatable. ", "There are some obvious consequences of this \"structural opposition culture\" in Bangladesh. First, it subverts peaceful coexistence and cooperation within political parties as \"opposition\" remains the main political agenda. Secondly, as opposition to rival political parties gets the highest market currency, the political leaders remain obsessed with finding newer and newer issues and methods to attack their political rivals. It brings to politics the practice of falsehood, concoction, active denial, fabrication, and construction of new realities. ", "During speeches in political gatherings, as political leaders spend more time on attacking political rivals rather than talking about pragmatic agendas for the nation's development, the practice of lying and concoction not only becomes normalised, but also more sophisticated methods of concocting or fabricating facts and realities to attack political rivals are always welcomed and applauded in the realm of politics. ", "Political rivalry and bitterness sometimes reach to such an extreme verge that some political leaders lose their last iota of patriotism and discursively concoct the nation as a \"fundamentalist\" or a \"breeding ground of Talibanism\" and so forth in order to invite foreign intervention. ", "Third, it generates fanaticism within politics. Since leaders are engrossed with attacking political rivals as a paramount route to become more popular, they not only suffer from human deficit such as a dramatic decline in appreciating good deeds and contribution of political rivals but also lose their far-sighting vision needed for country's development. ", "Consequently, no culture develops based on future vision as leaders are over-obsessed with attacking others. Country's development and progress then not only become secondary, but political realm also does not allow visionary and honest leaders. It then creates \"demo-crisis\" in which the country is deprived from not only pragmatic and visionary leaders but also conscious citizens and a vibrant civil society. ", "Finally, the structural opposition culture generates hatred, division, mistrust, unrest and continuous political tension. Sometimes political tension turns into violence and \"corpse politics\" (lash rajniti) emerges. If any political activist is killed out of any political violence, it is not generally regarded as a political loss, but the corpse becomes political capital to generate a new issue in political rivalry.   ", "Because of the decades-old structural opposition culture, a healthy political atmosphere with viable democratic practices did not develop, and the country remains retrogressive in a deeper manner. It permits foreign diplomats to poke their noses into the internal affairs of the country. ", "Eliminating some corrupted political leaders may shake but will not root out the long-established foundation of structural opposition culture. The current caretaker government -- if it is truly sincere to eliminate filthy political culture -- should pay more attention to culture and institutions than to individual persons.

Pervez Musharraf, among its fans.", "A musical, \"In the Name of God\" opened in Karachi and Lahore on July 20, amid tight security. Weeks earlier, the radical cleric and Red Mosque leader Abdul Rashid Ghazi had issued a fatwa against the film and its makers. And though Ghazi was one of more than 50 killed in the mosque assault in early July, copycat clerics continue to make the filmmakers and cinema-owners nervous. Fearing the worst, the film's writer and director, Shoaib Mansoor, has taken an extended vacation with his family outside Pakistan. And cinemas like Lahore's DHA -- located in a toney military-run neighbourhood -- are secured by armed sentinels, with ticketholders having to pass through metal detectors.", "The film itself is heavy on message and touches on a number of taboo topics: marital rape, forced marriage and jihad, tapping into Pakistan's anti-mullah mood as well as the customary popular disenchantment with the United States. Its plot centers on two brothers, one who goes from jeans-wearing musician to jihad-fighting fanatic; the other, arrested in Chicago after 9/11, is tortured into paralysis by US interrogators.", "Despite the controversy, \"In the Name of God\" has created such a buzz that the injunctions against it are largely being ignored; it's selling out movie houses across the country, and it's being credited with the revival of Lollywood, as Pakistan's film industry is called.

It's slated for release in the United States, Britain and India in the coming months.

There have been regular, sporadic protests marches every day since Sunday, when the former student leaders, known as the 888 Generation -- as they led the pro-democracy demonstrations in the streets nearly twenty years go -- initiated the first protest rally against the petrol price increases.", "These protests are very rare in Burma as the military regime keeps tight control. But the numbers joining these marches has grown since more than a hundred people joined the first demonstration demanding that the government immediately lower fuel and food prices.", "\"The government has raised fuel prices without giving any prior notice, and due to this hike, all the people are suffering. Therefore, we, the 88 generation students, NLD members, university students, high school students and civilians are protesting and demanding an immediate roll back in the prices of fuel,\" said one of the protestors at Sunday's march.", "More than thee hundred protested on Wednesday, in a guerrilla action in several parts of the city, according to eye-witnesses. \"We are marching to highlight the economic hardship that Myanmar people are facing now, which has been exacerbated by the fuel price hike,\" one of the protesters told local journalists covering the march. Later there were clashes with pro-government vigilantes; some were beaten and several whisked away in cars.", "\"More than 3,000 people have been on the streets in the last few days protesting against the government's economic policy,\" one of the protest organisers, Htay Kywe told this correspondent shortly before he was arrested by the authorities.", "The police have arrested more than a dozen key 888 generation student leaders and, including the internationally renowned activist and poet, Min Ko Naing and the charismatic Ko Ko Gyi, and organisers of the demonstrations from the recently formed Myanmar Development Committee. They were detained for \"undermining stability and the security of the nation,\" according to the state run media.", "Several university students who took part in one of the protests have also been detained. The authorities have been using thugs armed with sticks, from the pro-government community organization -- the Union, Solidarity and Development Association -- to stop and dispersed the demonstrations.", "\"The junta is not scared of public statements or press releases by opposition groups, but they really do not want the public to come out to the streets, for this type of movement can get out of hand,\" the student leader, Ko Ko Gyi told this correspondent recently, before his arrest.", "The arrests have only further fuelled public anger at the price increases.  \"More demonstrations are likely to follow, as Rangoon's residents are already fuming at the increase in fuel prices,\" according to western diplomat based in the country's capital.", "At midnight last Tuesday, Burma's ruling military junta unexpectedly raised the price of rationed fuel by as much as 500 per cent. Compressed natural gas, which the government has been promoting especially for commercial vehicles, was increased five fold, while diesel and petrol prices were more than doubled.", "Transport costs have already more than doubled throughout the country and the prices of essential goods are beginning to sky rocket.", "\"The poor people have been hit hardest,\" a European diplomat told this correspondent. \"They were already finding it hard to survive, and the increase in fuel charges and the knock-on affect on food prices will make it even harder,\" he said. \"It can only fuel further social unrest,\" he added.", "Bus fares and taxi charges doubled immediately in Rangoon, Mandalay and Moulmein. Already there is a substantially reduced service in many parts of Rangoon. Traffic generally in the city is substantially reduced as a result of the astronomic rise in the cost of black market petrol, which many Rangoon residents depend to fuel their cars.", "The increase in bus fares will severely affect the poor, said a financial analyst in Rangoon, who did not want to be identified. Manual workers and day-labourers in the country's main cities, who earn less than 2,000 kyat ($ 2) a day, will now have to pay more than half their wage in travel costs, he said. In some cases it may even be as much as three-quarters of their daily income.", "\"The increase in fuel costs will mean a rise in transport charges generally, which will then cause food prices to rise,\" said Win Min, an independent Burmese analyst based at Chiang Mai University. \"Inflation is already running at more than 40% a year and this could now more than double,\" he added.", "\"There will be an increase in lay-offs as businesses are forced to close and we are likely to see a significant rise in the prices of food, clothing and basic commodities,\" he said.", "Already in Rangoon food prices have risen steeply. Rice has risen by nearly 10 percent, edible oils by 20 percent, meat (pork and mutton) by around 15 percent, garlic and eggs both by 50 percent, according to aid workers in Rangoon who monitor the local market. A plate of Burmese noodles has tripled in the last week, an aid worker said.", "\"These price rises are crippling for most residents in Rangoon,\" a Burmese economist told this correspondent. \"They could hardly afford food before, now their weekly budget for essential foodstuffs is going to buy even less -- their purchasing power has been reduced by more than 25 percent virtually overnight.\"", "The people worse hit though are the retired government employees whose meagre pensions will now be almost worthless. One very elderly retired office worker complained to this correspondent that her pension now barely covered the taxi fare needed to go and pick it up.", "These price rises are bound to lead to increased demands for salary and wage increases to meet the inflationary impact on workers' incomes. It is highly unlikely that the government will increase these in the near future, having only recently granted government employees a major salary increase. The private sector is also going to find it hard to meet employees' demands to increase the wages bill.", "Businessmen are already complaining bitterly and some have even had to close their businesses -- at least temporarily. Besides running motor vehicles, diesel is also used by many families and shopkeepers to run small power generators which they use to combat the power blackouts that frequently hit Rangoon.", "An owner of a small printing works in Rangoon, who wanted to remain anonymous for fear of government reprisals, said the increase in diesel costs now made his business unprofitable. \"In the coming weeks more and more businesses, which use natural gas and diesel, are likely to be forced to close,\" a Burmese economist in Rangoon told this correspondent on condition of anonymity.", "Already restaurants and cafes are feeling the pinch. There is far fewer customers now than a week ago.

Now they are heavily committed to the construction an new Internet and Communications Technology centre -- along the lines of the US's Silicon Valley -- known as Yadanapon Cyber city near the new capital.", "\"I have long suspected that the cost of building Napyidaw was bleeding the government's coffers dry,\" a specialist on the Burma economy, Sean Turnell at the University of Macquarie told this correspondent.", "\"The government is acutely short of revenue Napyidaw is itself absorbing more than the increase in income from gas revenues. On top of that there is the dramatic pay rises in government salaries of last year, as well as now the potentially large expenditure needed for the planned nuclear reactor,\" he said.", "Over the past year the government has been trying to introduce a measure of financial regularity into government economic policy. The main aim has been to reduce government expenditure and increase government revenue.", "\"In the past the Burmese government regularly just printed money when funds were needed, but over the last year or so there has been a greater effort to introduce fiscal responsibility into government economic policy,\u201d Sean Turnell told the Daily Star.. \u201cInstead of simply printing money they have also tried to reduce expenditure on subsidies (on goods and fuel) and improve revenue collection.\"", "This rise in fuel charges will only increase the level of poverty in Burma.  \u201cMore than ninety percent of the country's population already lives in dire poverty,\u201d according to a Burmese economist. \u201cIt is not so much a case of food shortages as families' incomes being insufficient to purchase their daily needs,\u201d he added.", "UN country-wide surveys in last few years have revealed this trend of increased poverty in Burma and the growing income gap. \u201cMore than ninety percent of the population live on less than 300, 000 kyat (around $300) a year,\u201d a senior UN official told the Daily Star, but declined to be named.", "\u201cFood security has become a significant issue in many parts of the country, especially in the remote and border areas,\u201d he said. The worst areas are in Chin, Kachin, Rakhine and Shan states, according to a recent UN report seen by the the Daily Star.", "By far the worst area is Chin state, according to the UN surveys, where 40 percent of the population just do not get enough food to live on. In Chin state nearly three out four people live below the poverty line, according to the UN's resident humanitarian co-ordinator in Burma, Charles Petrie.", "In eastern and northern Shan state more than half the population live under the poverty line. \"They just do not have sufficient income to ensure food security, let alone provide a balanced or varied diet,\" according to one of the UN researchers.", "In the meantime the protests in the streets of Rangoon are likely to increase. Some Rangoon-based analysts are drawing parallels with the period prior to 1988, when the demonetarisation with sparked mass protests for democracy and brought the country to a standstill until the army brutally crushed the movement and seized power.", "\"There is little likelihood of a new people's power movement emerging,\" said a senior Burmese analyst, \"as the military learned their lesson last time and will try to nip it in the bud this time before it gets out of hand.\" What is certain is that there will be an dramatic increase in repression."], "tag": ["OP-ED"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=1256", "location": null, "date": "2007-08-24"}

The policy had sought to punish and quarantine India for its pursuit of nuclear weapons without any regard for its legitimate security concerns. The results were nothing short of perverse: India continued with its clandestine nuclear-weapons program, acquired and tested nuclear weapons and India-US relations suffered.", "The two sides could still find themselves at odds unless some key foreign-policy players in the US Congress display greater sensitivity toward India's acute concern about maintaining its autonomy in making critical foreign-policy choices.

Worse still, they have even sent a collective letter to the prime minister of India, exhorting him to dispense with these links.", "Few individuals in India's foreign- and security-policy establishments hold a candle for the understandably deplorable regime in Teheran. Yet they can ill-afford to dismantle India's connections with Iran for a number of compelling reasons. India, though few Americans are aware, has a substantial Shia population -- and thereby cannot easily ignore their sentiments. ", "More importantly, the particular features of the present Iranian regime aside, India needs to court Iran to counter the Pakistani-Saudi strategic nexus and their mutual coziness with Wahhabi Islamic zealots. Their closeness to the Wahhabi cult causes acute concern in New Delhi because India is also home to the second-largest Sunni population in the world, the vast majority of whom have not evinced any interest in the siren call of radical Islam.", "These strategic concerns alone make it imperative for India not to alienate any regime in Iran, however unpalatable its pronouncements on a variety of international issues. India is hardly alone in pursuing a policy of such ruthless pragmatism. The United States, we should remember, chose to court the reprehensible (and murderous) regime of Chairman Mao in its attempt to contain and hobble the menace of Soviet power. ", "More recently, it has had few, if any qualms of pursuing a robust commercial and military relationship with Saudi Arabia, a regime whose domestic arrangements can hardly be viewed as conforming with cherished American values. Nor has Saudi Arabia's mostly intransigent attitude toward Israel, a key American ally, significantly inhibited the US-Saudi nexus. ", "Since the end of the cold war, Indian politicians, in their attempts to forge a new relationship with the United States, have overcome their long-standing propensity to moralize and preach; for the most part they've chosen to maintain a studious public silence on a number of issues of American foreign policy.", "Will the United States now display similar pragmatism and show some sensitivity to India's concerns? The nuclear agreement is worth saving. Once ratified, it would allow India to maintain its nuclear-weapons program, purchase nuclear reactors and technology from the United States and other suppliers, and place 14 of India's 22 nuclear reactors under full-scope International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards.

Asadullah Khan", "headline": ["Water: Life and death"], "lastModified": null, "newsBody": ["To us, water is the most precious substance, the substance from which all life upon the earth has sprung and continues to depend. If we have no clean, drinkable water, we are doomed. This is exactly what has happened in the country of late. With flood water inundating almost one third of the country affecting the lives of about 20 million people and surface water getting seriously contaminated by sewage flow from open outlets, the country now faces an environmental disaster that threatens public health in the flood affected areas. As flood water recedes from different parts of the country, the incidence of diarrhoea and even cholera has shot up to an astounding number. With about one thousand patients getting admitted to the Icddrb hospital at Dhaka almost on a daily basis, the issue of drinking water pollution has featured most prominently.", "While explaining the cause of such huge number of cases, doctors at the Icddrb hospital pointed their fingers at the WASA water supplies being contaminated severely which the WASA authorities have consistently denied. Undeniably true, earlier studies indicated that the country's rivers were among the most polluted and contained ten times as many bacteria from human waste as waterways in any other country. Now with the sewage flow from open outlets containing human excreta compounding the water pollution crisis, the lives and livelihoods of millions are at risk and the nightmare has only just begun.", "In the backdrop of the crisis now mounting up with abundance of water because of the flood, Dhaka and its periphery on the other hand routinely lives through water cuts from January to June every year. Rural Bangladesh, yet to be acquainted with the tap water culture is worse off as ground water levels have plunged in most of the districts. ", "Like so many of the earth's bounty, water is unevenly distributed. Water covers 75 percent of the Earth's surface -- 97.5 percent of that is salty and only 2.5 percent is fresh water. Icecaps and glaciers hold 74 percent of the world's freshwater, almost all the rest is in deep groundwater aquifers, or locked in soils as moisture or permafrost. Only 0.3 percent of the world's freshwater is found in rivers and lakes. Less than 1 percent of the world's surface or below- ground freshwater is accessible for human use. At the dawn of the new millennium, more than one billion people do not have access to safe drinking water, and 3.4 million die each year from water related diseases. ", "Within the next 20 years, half the world's population could have trouble finding enough fresh water for drinking and irrigation. Currently over 80 countries, representing 40 percent of the world's people are subject to serious water shortages. Conditions may get worse as in the next few years as populations grow and as global warming disrupts rainfall patterns. Part of Asia faces the greatest threat. Over 90 percent of the region's population is experiencing severe water stress, with water consumption exceeding 10 percent of renewable freshwater resources. In Bangladesh and adjoining areas, people living without access to adequate water and sanitation are the poorest and most vulnerable. The problem is particularly severe in remote rural areas and rapidly growing urban areas. As much as 90 percent of waste water in developing countries like ours is discharged into rivers and streams. Water-borne diseases are responsible for 80 percent of illnesses and deaths in the developing world, killing a child every eight second. ", "It is comforting to learn that per capita residential use in Europe runs as high as about 200 litres. This is not surprising in view of the fact that European commission made water protection and sustainable management one of the priorities of its environmental and research goals. In contrast, Bangladesh situation, especially the situation in big cities like Dhaka, Narayanganj, Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi in respect of water hazard and contamination is appalling. Factories in these big cities and also the city dwellers happily discharge harmful chemicals and toxic wastes into rivers while growing need for food induces farmers to use agrochemicals, insecticides and pesticides that further pollute the river water. Mentionably, ground water is the main source of supply through Deep Tube Well (DTW) either in the cities or for irrigation in rural areas. But the yearly recharge of the aquifer is less than the abstraction. Growing dependence on ground water for these needs is lowering the water table, making arsenic contamination the most pervasive health hazard the country has been experiencing now.", "Rivers in developed countries because of increased awareness and education of the citizenry have become much cleaner over the last two decades. On the other hand rivers in the poorest developing countries, by contrast have shown marked falls in levels of dissolved oxygen\u00bea key indicator of increased pollution by sewage. ", "The first signs of population boom and water stress were visible in the 1980s, but the water management board at that time focused on the immediate -- tapping groundwater resources in the whole country. Expectedly, the pressure on ground water has shown up. And as basins and rivers dry up, it also threatens the country's food security, because most of our freshwater is used to grow food. While the daily drinking water needs of every person is approximately four litres, between 2000 and 5000 litres of water are needed to produce an individual's food requirements. More importantly, agriculture accounts for over 80 percent of world water consumption. It is estimated that between 14 and 17 percent more water will be needed for irrigation by 2030 to feed the world's growing population. ", "With the level of groundwater dropping at an annual rate of nearly 15 feet as WASA sources say, supply of water would be extremely scarce within a few years. Experts argue that over-extraction, lack of retention points for recharging groundwater, pollution in the waterways adjacent to the cities and towns, and a natural impermeable clay layer have combined to further push the level down to an unreachable depth of the earth's crust. Water is being mined and pumps are being sunk three to six feet deeper every year. ", "Dhaka WASA supplies roughly 120 crore litres from its deep tube-wells against its daily requirement of 160 litres while its surface water treatment plants at Lalbagh and Godnail provides less than five crore litres. It is now trying to strike a balance between surface and underground water at least in the city. But that idea seems to be building castles in the air because Dhaka city is increasingly becoming \u201cbuilt up\u201d with rapid depletion of open spaces, wetlands, canals and rivers and an annual growth of about eight lakh people leaving no space for the ground water to be recharged. With about 97 percent of the city's water supply coming from underground source, there is an imperative need to use surface water to have that balance. Because once a break is applied to extraction, groundwater would automatically get recharged. But how can that be achieved? ", "With water of the Buriganga and the Shitalakhya being polluted at an alarming rate, experts are not sure if it could be treated at any of the plants. The Hon'ble Adviser in charge of the Ministry of LGED has been telling in meetings and seminars that efforts are underway to bring water from the river Jamuna to meet Dhaka city's water gap. Sensible citizenry feel that the cash starved Dhaka WASA can ill-afford the cost of such an endeavour. Shockingly, conservation has not figured in the government's scheme of things either during the past regime or even now when the government is run by a band of dedicated people with no political motive or agenda. ", "Leaving aside the Buriganga and the Shitalakhya that now symbolise little life, water in the Gulshan-Baridhara and Uttara lakes is now a receptacle of human wastes, raw sewage and toxic industrial effluents from various industrial units. According to a study conducted by the DoE in the recent past, these lakes' water carries a bacteria count of 1200 in place 200 or less that is considered to be a tolerable count in water bodies. Uttara Lake, once a vast transparent water body stretching from one end of sector no.3 to sector no.11 at least 5 km. in length and 400 m wide is now a stagnant pool of polluted water because of indiscriminate dumping of household garbage, wastes and raw sewage from the bustling residential buildings all around. Its width and length have shrunk with construction going apace and people coming in to settle. ", "Known to be the barometer of the ecological health of a city, water bodies, other than being sources of surface water, determine its climate. As experts explain, they help control humidity and temperature levels, recharge aquifers and also act as instruments of rainwater harvesting. With a little initiative, commitment and imagination these lakes could be formed into a hydrological chain and during monsoon, surplus water from the upstream lake could be flowed into the next lake.", "The process of cleaning and recharging may undoubtedly be a long drawn one. The first step is to identify the sources and entry points of sewage discharge into the lakes and waterbodies and divert it to suitable place for safe disposal. It is worth mentioning here that under Indian government's National lake conservation project, the LDA (Lake Development Authority) has cleaned up in just about a year12 odd lakes. One of Bangalore's biggest lakes -- the 50 hectare Ulsoor -- was drained out and sewage lines were blocked. With funds from the donor agencies other than the government itself, Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board started laying pipes leading to the treatment plant. Now catch-water drains have to be built to collect water run-off. That done, water has to be purified using hydrophyllic plants that absorb dissolved pollutants and toxins. ", "What happened in Bangalore was that in 1995 a sudden rise in the death of freshwater fish in lakes like Sankey and Lalbagh sounded an alarm and the government then took comprehensive plan for restoration of such lakes. Unhappily in our country mass death of fish in the Baridhara-Gulshan lake in 2002 and also in recent time could not sensitise much the administration that other than being an aesthetic and ecological utility the lakes could be a vast source of poor man's protein. ", "Like the one that our neighbouring country had taken up, the present caretaker government that has brought about many reforms in different sectors, may now be considering the modalities of raising external and internal funds on the lines of the World Bank aided programme for integrated countrywide tank and lake development for irrigation, ecological balance and aesthetic quality of the cities and countryside. Such development work can fruitfully be done when governmental efforts combine with individual civic initiatives.

", "The Forest Department (FD) carried out the first round of its war against banana on 13, 14, 15 and 22 February, and 7 March. After 7 March, the government gave time to the banana cultivators and advised them to voluntarily stop banana plantation on the forestland after the harvest of their standing crops. ", "In a meeting on 9 March, the forest and environment adviser Dr. C.S. Karim, formed a 12-member committee (two chairmen of two union councils in forest area were later co-opted to the committee) including the Garos and sought suggestions from the committee as regards eco-park, protection of sal forest, land use practices, etc. ", "On the day of the first meeting of the committee, on 18 March, the alleged killing of Chalesh Ritchil took place. Four meetings of the committee took place ever since. However, none of the members from among the Garos and NGOs got minutes or report of any meeting.

We will not spare any marauder on the forestland,\" warned the FD official. \"We want the Adivasis to participate in forestry programmes and stay protected. A Garo household participating in the forestry will get one ha of land and share benefits from plantation. We are yet to work out the details of the participation mechanism. We will consider the suggestions from the committee and experts in this regard.\"", "In the war against banana, the Garos find themselves in an inept condition. In the recent years, they have been indeed got heavily engaged in banana plantation that brings them quick and handsome cash. However, the top players behind the banana cultivation are the Bengali traders who brought the idea of banana cultivation on a massive scale. They also provided cash. The Garos in most of the forest villages in Modhupur even replaced their age-old gardens of pineapple, jackfruits, lemon, etc. with banana. Now they find that hope for big and quick cash banana further complicates their land questions. ", "With typical vegetation disappearing with the invasion of banana, the Garos are in real difficult situation in establishing their traditional rights over the high land.  They normally have title deeds for the low land (baid) but in most cases, they do not have title deeds for the highland they have been occupying from time immemorial. These highlands with native vegetation were gradually declared as protected or reserved at different times after the abolition of the Zamindari system. ", "The Garo representatives on the committee to resolve the problem in the Modhupur sal forest say they were surprised when the raid against banana resumed on 1 August. As the days passed by the intensity of raid increased and the number of hired labourers raised.\t", "To give an idea how the daily raid against banana takes place let us see the picture of one day. On 17 August, approximately 500 labourers, with dao (homemade chopper) and spade in hands swooped on banana gardens in Atashbari-Nayanpur area. The security personnel were present on the spot. Present on the spot were also officials of the Forest Department and administration. Few hundred Garos, most of them women, assembled and helplessly appealed to the government officials to spare the banana gardens. Their appeal was ignored and the banana plants in the area were felled. ", "On the same day, a similar group of hired laborers was reportedly engaged in another part of the forest to clear banana gardens. The top cats behind the banana plantation, the Bengali traders who make heavy investment in banana, remained largely unseen.  ", "The government officials were telling the Garos that they were recovering forestland and planting trees with the consent of their leaders on the committee. However, one Garo leader on the committee refuted the claim. \"The FD has not followed our decisions about planting trees in place of banana gardens,\" said the leader. He complained that he has not received any reports of any of the meetings although he has asked for it repeatedly. \"We agreed to plant trees ourselves; not the way it is being done now\".  He also complained that no village demarcation or survey was conducted. ", "A high official in the FD says it is because of dearth of saplings of local species that acacia is being planted. He claims some local species have also been planted. \"From next year we will plant more local species,\" says the FD official. \t", "Ideally, the forest of native species, especially sal, must be established after the termination of banana plants. Why? Because the exotic species -- acacia and eucalyptus (planting of this alien was stopped after the first rotation) -- in particular planted under \u201csocial forestry\u201d in Modhupur have proven to be politically and ecologically mistaken. The \u201csocial forestry\u201d itself has been blamed to be a sugarcoat for plantation. ", "The Garos who are seemingly innocent victims of commercial banana plantation, now find that after chopping down of banana plants acacia is being planted. The environmentalists are also very unhappy. Although some FD officials would call acacia a \u201csoldier tree\u201d meaning it can survive tough climate condition, this alien is perhaps good for fuelwood but cannot be a replacement for the native sal or other local species. The ADB and World Bank that funded massive-scale plantation of this alien species have withdrawn from the forestry sector altogether leaving the Forest Department and other stakeholders on a hotspot, very difficult to manage.    ", "Therefore, while the government officials keep telling the Garos that they are out there to protect them and bring back the native vegetation, the first people of the forest who have the knowledge of traditional forest management see no direction and become even more worried. ", "The participation of the Garos in afforestation proposed by the FD is also not welcome by the Garos. They have the bitter experience of woodlot and agroforestry that have rapidly eaten up the native forests. Almost the same model the FD talks about brings no better option for them. ", "Many see the massive-scale banana plantation on the forestland as a multiplier effect of manmade \"forests\" among other things. The idea of this so-called manmade forest sugarcoated as \u201csocial forestry\u201d came along the loans from the concessional window of the Asian Development Bank. In Modhupur monoculture plantation of primarily exotic acacia and eucalypts took place under two ADB funded projects -- Thana Afforestation and Nursery Development Project (TANDP) and Forestry Sector Project (FSP). TANDP with two major components -- woodlot and agroforestry -- started in 1989 and ended in 1995. When monoculture started with the ADB loan, the local people were appalled to see that the native sal coppices were indiscriminately cut to prepare grounds for the manmade forests. ", "Ten years later people found most of the plantation stolen or officially harvested. The land became vacant, perfect ground for invasion by banana and papaya plantation. Pineapple was already there. Outsiders invaded the forestland for large-scale banana and papaya plantation. They lured the Garos even to convert their home gardens into banana gardens.  This process started largely due to ADB's investment strategies in the forestry sector, it is generally believed. ", "After the first rotation of plantation, the government awaited another loan from ADB for the Forestry Sector Project (FSP). The project that was supposed to start in 1997 was much delayed. In the meantime, ADB made Bangladesh Government to amend the Forest Act of 1927 in favor \"social forestry\" that is essentially plantation. The delay caused the forestland to remain vacant for a longer period. The banana, papaya and pineapple cultivators took control of the forestland and spoiled it thoroughly in a short period. The allegation that the corrupt FD officials turned out to be accomplices for extra cash is not unfounded. ", "For the last few years, the Modhpur Salbon (sal forest) has gained an infamous image as Modhupur Kalabon (banana forest). According to a top FD source, the sal patches in the Modhupur survive only on 6,000 acres today (2007). According to the DFO of Tangail [in 2004] who is now hiding with corruption charges, out of 46,000 acres in Tangail part of the Modhupur sal forests 25,000 acres had gone into illegal possession and the FD controlled only 9,000 acres by 2004. ", "How come such massive-scale grabbing of the forestland occurred?  Why did the FD [that now takes advantage of the state of emergency in recovering the forestland] stay passive? These questions need to be seriously addressed in understanding what have gone wrong in Modhupur. ", "The FD has apparently targeted 3,600 acres of forestland for recovery and plantation this year. What about the bigger chunks of the forestland illegally grabbed? There are many evidences how the forestland given out for plantation has been abused by the banana and papaya cultivators. There are indeed many papaya gardens illegally established on the forestland. In the war against banana, papaya plantations also illegally established on the forestland, remain unattended for now.  ", "However, a top FD official says that they will deal with the illegal papaya plantation at a later stage.", "A look over the protected parts of the Modhupur National Park from the two towers recently built in Dokholoa and Lohoria gives us a ray of hope. The monsoon greenery of the native vegetation is absolute. This is what we want gradually expanded in other parts within the forest boundaries. For that, here are some suggestions to ponder. ", "Inventories as regards exactly how much of the Modhupur sal forest is left today and how much of the forestland has been illegally occupied can provide handles for right direction in saving native patches and expanding them. It is not just the banana, an inventory of papaya and pineapple gardens need to be done. A complete list of the marauders on the forestland should be made public, Then the crusade against them will become transparent and effective with public support. Different stakeholders, environmentalists, and experts should participate in inventory exercise without fear.     ", "Caution about choice of exotic species: One harsh reality about forests is that man can plant trees, but cannot create a native forest. In the Modhupur sal forest area, native vegetation had been cleared for planting exotic ones such as rubber, acacia and eucalyptus. External resources played an important role in it. While eucalyptus plantation was stopped after the first rotation of plantation, acacia continued in the second rotation that started around 2002.  The invasive acacia remains to be a dominant species in plantation to date. For the sake of creating some forests, which is difficult indeed, local species -- sal and others -- must be preferred. In plantation efforts, seeds of local species must be fully utilised from the next season. The forest professionals including those in the Forest Department say, 'complex' or mixed plantation must be preferred to 'simple' or monoculture plantation.    ", "The Garos and the Koch are the original inhabitants of the Modhupur forest. Their traditional rights over highland need to be recognised. What the authority says overtly about their protection and that of the forest, must be materialised concretely. The Adivasi communities cannot survive without state protection. If they are protected, the forests are better managed."], "tag": ["Environment"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=1957", "location": " the Forest Department has resumed its war against banana in Modhupur.

This year it has been fixed at 10.8% while Nepal's is fixed at 14%. He maintained that if we could raise this ratio, then we could dismantle ERD, only IRD would suffice and we could dispense with foreign aid. He further said that no self respecting person would like to work in the ERD swallowing the insult and harsh conditions of donors. Therefore, there is no substitute of taxation. \"We have a tax evasion culture. And the NBR couldn't adequately discharge the responsibilities of motivating the tax payer,\" he said. He also acknowledged that there were yet some complaints of harassment of taxpayers, while they should be respected. Good results cannot be achieved by harassment; it has to be achieved by showing respect and love for them, he stated. Commenting on tax reforms, he opined. \"Collecting tax by coercive means isn't reform. Reform means devising a system whereby people would pay tax being self-motivated.\"", "Dr. Kazi Kholiquzzaman said, \"Our people become happy if they have to pay no tax. This attitude has to be changed.\" Professor Abul Barakat revealed that there were Tk two lakh crore of undeclared money and if this amount could be made legal, Tk  60,000 crore of tax could be collected. This amount is more than the country's total revenue income and is enough to dispense with foreign aid, he said.", "Previously, by saying that only death and income tax payment were inescapable, Adviser for Finance and Commerce Mirza Azizul Islam put so much emphasis on tax payment that no other Adviser/Minister ever did. Given this commitment and endeavour of the present government, revenue collection would definitely improve, but something unusual must be done to dramatically augment income tax payment by individuals who are mostly very modest earners,  devoid of any capacity to save for rainy days. Had there been an adequate social security system in place and prudent govt. spending, people wouldn't have been so tax averse as we see today. It is not proper to say that our people enjoy tax evasion. All and sundry (including the poorest of the poor) regularly pay taxes in different shapes without any grudge. It is easy to pay. But income tax is neither easy to calculate, nor easy to defend.", "Therefore, the oft-repeated harassment is a reality in Bangladesh.", "The present drive is wrought with this evil. Hence the number of taxpayers is destined not to rise appreciably. Apart from traditional reasons, the present situation is also responsible for this. Presently, the legally earned income which wasn't declared is called black money and this may be made white within 30 September 2007 by declaring it and paying usual taxes plus 5% fine on it. But the calculation of the money remaining undeclared for years is neither easy nor, in most cases, encouraging to pay tax on it. ", "The fast rising inflation (the maddening rise in cost of living) is a definite deterrent for modest income earners to pay even a few thousand taka of tax now. So it would be futile at the moment to ask for taxes on undeclared income of those who cannot make a decent living these days. ", "It would therefore be wise to bring all or as many eligible taxpayers as possible into the tax net by declaring tax amnesty for all who would submit tax returns by a given date, say 30 Sept. 2007. Only then the talk of Tk 60,000 crore of tax collection, harassment free tax payment environment, dispensing with foreign aid and the ERD, getting rid of the insulting conditions of donors, etc. would be meaningful.

Wherever one goes, whatever subject one talks about one hears the topic invariably almost everywhere, especially in tea stalls. You open a newspaper and you will find this as news, letters to the editors, articles highlighting plight of the middle class and lower middle class people and so on. The leading  economists have varied and often diverse opinions regarding the causes of the price hike.", "As a lay man,  I think the price of a particular thing depends on (a) Production costs, (b) Carrying/Transportation costs and (c) Free marketing (syndication free). For agro-based items, production costs depend on a. Seeds b. Fertilisers. c. Irrigation and d. Pesticide (not encouraged). Easy and cheap availability of these items will definitely reduce the costs of production, as costs of labour are too low. The government's  input here is to ensure supply of good quality seeds, making available the required quantity of fertilisers and water for irrigation where/when required. Barendra project of North Bengal is a shining example. For long term benefits,  research should be a continuous process.", "Next is transportation. With the rise of fuel price the costs of transportation have also gone up. The costs of transportation by road from remote areas, say Dinajpur on the north to Dhaka city,  will be very high. Compared to road, transport by rail and river  is cheaper.  So, if railway is provided with refrigerated containers it can bring fresh/perishable items to Dhaka at a very cheap rate. There is another price tag in overall transportation costs i.e. carrying goods in push-carts from the wholesale market to retail market. This keeps on varying with different factors which include fixed costs plus hartal costs plus extortion and systems loss on the way. To reduce all these transportation costs,  Tongi Railway Junction should be the major wholesale market for goods carried by railway. Transportation by truck from places of shorter distances  like Mymensingh, Comilla should continue. Goods carried on rooftop of the bus may be allowed,  provided that is not unsafe. Full advantage of the local trains running between Dhaka-Mymensingh, Dhaka-Comilla should be taken for carrying fresh vegetables from these areas. ", "The next factor  that I think influences the market is ease of marketing/selling. Unauthorised toll collection must be checked. Today Dhaka city has a population  of over ten million, so, there should be minimum ten wholesale markets spread evenly all over Dhaka,  depending on density of population. This will also bring the wholesale markets near to the retail shops,  thus reducing extra costs of carrying by vans and push-carts. Dhaka is surrounded by a green belt. Small farmers should be able to sell their produce directly to the consumers. ", "If these steps are taken it is hoped that the situation will ease to a great extent.

I know exactly what should be the curriculum for that class. They should study history, philosophy, and lots of religion. No math since they have already done enough calculation. Throw in a little bit of literature. I would highly recommend \"The Rocking Horse Winner\" by D.H. Lawrence. These people have to learn that what they have done is very very wrong.", "No, I am not trying to be funny. The seminary should be started to prevent a future avalanche of counterculture. I have talked to some of the admirers, relatives, friends and children of the politicians and businessmen who have been arrested since the crackdown on corruption. In their minds they are convinced that their loved ones are victims of circumstances, innocent people, who are paying price for love their country.", "That line of thinking needs to be addressed so that another thirty-six years down the road we aren't drawn into another conflict. It is possible that once again the political wheel is going to turn when the victor's hand will write history that will undermine the vanquished. If left to the current state of doubts, this nation in future will be drowned by renewed shouting match over who was innocent and who was guilty.", "It means, once again the nation will stand divided over right and wrong. This is where the seminary can help, because unless the guilty are convinced of their guilt, the people who love them will not be convinced. It is, therefore, necessary that we work to change their minds while they serve their sentence. It is not enough to physically accept the punishment unless it is also accepted in the minds.", "In other societies, people do it all the time. A US senator from Idaho pleaded guilty to  lewd behaviour. He was arrested for making sexual advances to an undercover officer in an airport men's room. He sat in the stall next to the officer who was monitoring the washroom, tapped his right foot to the left foot of his prey and then made hand motions under the partition between them to show that he was interested. ", "In another instance, an American football player, who stood to gain $100 million or more, pleaded guilty to animal cruelty. He ran a dog fighting business which was perfectly alright, until the world came to know how brutally he treated his dogs. He shot, hanged and electrocuted those dogs which lost a fight. ", "As a matter of fact, every crime is a moral crisis and seeks a closure in justice. That is when the power is taken away from the criminal and the balance is tweaked in favor of the victim. But that equation is often skewed in political propaganda as Goebbels embodied in his famous quote: \"A lie repeated a thousand times becomes a truth.\" The camaraderie amongst the well-wishers of all those who will be jailed could turn into an enormous propaganda machine cranking out true lies, strengthened and accelerated by political network and unaccounted money. ", "Needless to say a crime isn't fully recompensed until there is an acceptance of guilt. But only the guilty knows best where the guilt pinches, his confession being more powerful than a thousand judgments. The opposite could create the smokescreen, swaying the hearts and minds of those who tend to believe in their leaders, parents, brothers, sisters and friends. A thousand judgments will not change their opinion until it comes from the horse's mouth.", "So the seminary can play a role to prepare the jailbirds to fess up their own misdeeds. And then they would face those who are close to them, people who are deceived by their looks and take them by the face value. They would need to unlearn the familiar world of greed and need, and unburden their souls of accumulated desires to find the truth that it was not the end doesn't justify the means.", "\"There must be more money,\" says the mother in \"The Rocking Horse Winner\" when the son asked why she was unhappy. The son wanted to know why they were poor, and the mother replied that his father didn't have any luck. The son asked again if money was luck to which the mother said that luck was what caused one to have money. Then she said that luck was better than money because \"if you're rich, you may lose your money. But if you're lucky, you will always get more money.\" ", "Here lies the crux of knowledge, which should resonate in the seminary. The Class of 2007, if that is what all the people given jail terms for corruption this year are called, should learn that one of the many surprises of life is that luck can run out before money. It will bring them an opportunity, many of them in the company of their children and spouses, to discuss amongst themselves that no matter how clever and calculating one is, luck always has the last laugh when it comes to life's eventualities.", "And the eventualities are indeed stunning. Former ministers given rigourous imprisonment are being assigned new roles in prison. One former minister is working as a gardener, another as a librarian, and others might become cooks, clerks or assume even lesser roles. In so much as they will fit into these roles and live reconditioned lives, it will do wonders if they also learn to reorganise their minds. ", "It will also change the minds of those who are blind about them. Unassimilated truth is the mother of all contentions and it grows cantankerous in the seedbed of long-seething vengeance.  An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.  But when one man blindly follows another, it is even worse. The whole world can erupt in the blink of an eye.

Caretaker governments by definition have no political base.  This is their great weakness as well as their great strength.  The strength lies in the fact that they are, by their very composition (in this case, at least) non-political and thus non-partisan.  They can preside over everyday affairs of state without taking sides and can therefore deliver a free and fair election (their intended function under the constitution) or can level the playing field and clean up the system (as this government is doing).", "But their weakness is that even when they have well-wishers, they do not have active supporters.  They do not have cadres or loyalists or people who will take to the streets to defend them when the chips are down.  ", "This makes their existence extremely precarious and explains why every caretaker government we have ever had (even the last one) thus far has been so keen to get out of the firing line as soon as is humanly possible: to hold elections within 90 days and then get out.", "But this government is different.  It is not in for 90 days.  By the time elections are held, if all goes according to schedule, it will have held power for almost two years.  That's a long time for a government without a political base.  That's a long time for nothing to go wrong.", "And, of course, things will go wrong.  It's Murphy's Law.  And, truthfully, as far as this government is concerned, just about everything that could have gone wrong has gone wrong.  Minus two.  Minus one.  Prices.  Power.  Jute.  Floods. Court cases.  The only saving grace was that it hadn't had to face any serious protest, at least until August 20.", "So what is the lesson to be learned from this incident?

His expectations are also those of the nation as a whole, which is why we urge the government to move expeditiously towards creating an enabling political environment through doing away with the ban on indoor politics. If, however, the government has certain reservations about lifting the ban or feels that some minimal restrictions must accompany a lifting of the ban on indoor politics, it must seriously consider raising them with the political parties in order for a solution to be arrived at. By its very nature, indoor politics is itself a restrictive affair. Making it more restrictive may defeat the very purpose of lifting it. Another component of the EC's plan involves the inner working mechanism of the parties themselves. For its dialogue plan to be successful, the EC has to ensure that those who speak to it on behalf of their parties have a truly representative character and are fully involved with the decision-making apparatus in the parties and therefore have the mandate to decide on the reform proposals. It is extremely important that the EC's plans create the conditions that will allow politicians to initiate discussions on such plans at different layers within their respective party structures. The government must realise in its own interest that the parties must be in a position to own the plans if they are to pay off. Any sidetracking of the decision-making mechanism of the parties will have negative consequences, with the reforms agenda within the parties threatening to become a casualty.

Both the words, Lailat in Arabic and Shab in Persian, mean night, and Baraat means salvation or privilege. It is on this auspicious night of privilege or night of salvation that benign providence, in His infinite mercy, blesses each and every human being with a unique opportunity to receive the most coveted divine mercy. ", "Lailat-ul-Baraat has not been mentioned directly or specifically in the Holy Quran, but that does not, in any way, empower any Muslim to ignore or make little of the divine excellence of the night of salvation, simply because there are numerous authentic hadith and evidence which testify so eloquently to the fact that the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) himself used to say special prayers on this holy night. ", "What is more, the Holy Prophet used to offer this prayer with inimitable dedication and unfathomable concentration.  There are many hadith which very clearly indicate that the Holy Prophet not only said special prayers in this sacred night but also visited the graveyards and prayed for the departed souls. He also instructed his wives to honour the sanctity and divine majesty of this blessed night. ", "It is not only the renowned traditionalists who champion the sacredness and excellence of the night of privilege, even a great and universally respected saint and scholar like Hazrat Syed Abdul Quader Jilani (RA), popularly known as Hazrat Bara Pir Sahib, testifies in his \"Guniatut Talebin\" that Bibi Ayesha Siddiqa (RA) herself heard the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) saying: \"Allah opens the doors of mercy and grace for mankind on four nights -- the two nights of Eids, the night of the 15th of Sha'ban, and the night of Arafat.  The doors remain open throughout the nights, till the fajr prayers.\"", "Glorious incidents like these testify so brilliantly to the Holy Prophet's belief in the importance, sanctity, serenity and divine excellence of the auspicious night of privilege.", "It is claimed that on the holy night of privilege the heavenly tree, Sidrat-ul-Muntaha, specifically mentioned in the Holy Quran (LIII:4), is shaken to decide who shall die in the following year. \"According to popular belief,\" says the Encyclopaedia of Islam, \"in the night preceding the 15th of Sha'ban the tree of life on whose leaves are written the names of the living is shaken. The names written on the leaves which fall down indicate those who are to die in the coming year.\" ", "Lailat-ul-Baraat, the night of quittancy, is indeed a solemn and sacred occasion of divine excellence, which has to be celebrated in a befitting way, not through candles and crackers, not through mere halwa and roti, not through extravagance and merry-making, but through prayers and penance, as was done by the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). ", "It is true that hundreds and thousands of Muslims in Bangladesh celebrate this night through zealous and active participation in private and congregational prayers held in mosques. Unfortunately, however, there are many among us who, through sheer ignorance or utter carelessness, turn this auspicious night into a mere occasion of merry-making and gaiety, fun and frolic, forgetting the very essence of this glorious night.", "There are some who think that crackers and candles are part and parcel of Shab-e-Baraat. Nothing can be farther from the truth. This awful custom, introduced by the Barmecides in Baghdad, simply because they were fireworshippers and loved fire even after they accepted Islam, not  only disturbs the namazis and meditators on this auspicious night, but also leads to unnecessary wastage and prodigality, which are forbidden in Islam. ", "There are also some who try to equate halwa and roti with the sacred night of privilege, claiming that the Holy Prophet lost a few teeth in the Battle of Ohud on the 15th of Sha'ban and, hence, people should not cook anything hard as a mark of respect to that historic incident. Some also claim that Hazrat Amir Hamza (RA) embraced martyrdom on the 15th of Sha'ban.", "Both these claims are totally baseless, as both the incidents occurred in the month of Shawal and had simply nothing to do with the 15th or any other day of the month of Sha'ban. There is no harm if delicious halwas and other sweetmeats are cooked on this occasion, but let these be prepared only to be shared with the poor and the have-nots. The very spirit of such a noble and auspicious occasion will be lost if those who are affluent fail to share their good fortune with those who are less privileged.", "Our duty on this night of privilege, or night of salvation, is not only to seek divine mercy but also to seek the path of goodness, kindness, upright conduct, and charity -- to be always on our toes to respond to the cry of the neediest, to stand by the word that is pledged, to bear true witness, to remove all artificial differences between man and man, and all causes of misunderstanding in our dealings with our fellow brethren in every sphere of activity, in every domain of thought."], "tag": ["OP-ED"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=1801", "location": null, "date": "2007-08-29"}

Even after a year of investigation and research, the gentlemen working on the report could not find the end of the tail of the ageing, and dying, creature. Consider the creature to be Biman, and the tail thereof being corruption and inefficiency, and you know why the end could not be found -- because there have not been any!", "The research behind the diagnostic report by Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) went between March 2006 - June 2007, and the researchers mentioned how difficult it was for them to be able to access information from Biman, especially till the end of 2006, thanks to the then ruling BNP government and the short-lived caretaker government (till January11, 2007). ", "The truth always finds its way out, and more often than not ends up in the hands of the right people. The TIB researchers also got hold of enough information, and enough truth, to prepare a decent report despite the virtual \"do not cross\" line they had to face repeatedly at the ministry, and at Biman itself.", "At the publication conference of the report by TIB on August 8, the discussants unanimously mentioned corruption as the airline's biggest problem. They also unanimously believed that if corruption can be driven out of the airline, it can thrive even in the ever-competitive world of commercial aviation of today. Through this article, I will reiterate some of the viewpoints expressed by a few of the discussants and add my own voice with theirs.", "Dr. MA Momen, the Managing Director of the airline, admitted of the rampant corruption that had corroded the airline through almost its entire life. He also admitted his failure to uplift the airline's image and acceptance to the passengers -- the people who are essential for the airline's survival. ", "aBetween the lines, he also reminded us of a harsh truth -- that the chair of the managing director is not an easy one to sit on at Biman, for the entire control of the airline lies with the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism, and the managing director would have to face daily heat, and struggle to bring about any change for good defying the directives from the ministry.", "I personally believe, and expect most to agree with me, in saying that despite all the failures, he has one very important feather in his cap -- that being of having save the airline from the collapse that was impending during September/October 2006. That collapse was allegedly a design by the then high-ups of the government, and Dr. Momen had done a brilliant, and daring, job to foil the plan. ", "But that is where the challenge for him just begins -- he must continue to be brilliant and daring for achieving sustainable success for the airline. In order to do that, he will have to dare challenge his own excellence, day in and day out.", "Captain Nasimul Haque, the retired veteran pilot from Biman and former president of the Bangladesh Airline Pilots' Association (BAPA), emphasized on bringing sensibility to policymaking that will drive the nation's future in commercial aviation. He and many other pilots of Biman have been victims of ill policymaking by the \"high-ups,\" who were also the ignorant of the highest order in the field of commercial aviation, and essentially only occupied important decision-making posts at the ministry and the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB).", "Numerous pilots, like Captain Nasim himself, were expensively trained by Biman, conforming to international standards, and from one government to another, many of these pilots who were extremely valuable assets were put off Biman simply because of political polarisation. I am not saying that unfit pilots, or those with proven acts of irresponsibility on duty, were to be retained by Biman. ", "What I am saying is that if a pilot is deemed, unfit by the CAAB under certain criterion peremeter, then the CAAB should as well apply the same regulations for all international operators flying into Bangladesh, as far as passenger safety is concerned. Otherwise, politically knocking off expensively trained pilots should be considered a criminal offense. It is your money and mine, and we ought not to let scoundrels mess around with it!", "Another pilot present at the conference, Captain Maqsood read out and excerpt form an e-mail by Boeing to Biman, where they explicitly stated that while they found Biman officials to be fairly rational and in comprehension of their responsibilities, Boeing's found the government officials to be \"far from professional, and far from being transparent.\" ", "This is actually the result of the government's attempt with Boeing over the past few years to strike a hideous deal for aircraft, order which would allow them to pocket millions of dollars in the form of unsolicited commission. Boeing, as the largest exporter of the United States, and with the US Trade Advocacy Bureau doing its job did not need to please these officials and it is the greed of these people that has deprived Biman to take advantage of what was then a very competitive fleet renewal offer from Boeing.", "Eminent journalist Mohammad Jahangir stressed that exemplary justice must be served to those who, over the decades and from under their political umbrella, unleashed the endless practice of corruption at Biman, and has reduced the airline to what it is today. This is particularly important, because if it is not done the galloping corruption would only slow down for a brief period and soon gain momentum again. It is all known -- who abused Biman over the last at least 25 years, and how they did it. Taking them to task is now an imperative task by itself!", "One of the very few respectable lawmakers from our legacy political parties, Col. (Retd.) Farooq Khan, stated that the airline ought to become more efficient in its operations, and should do better to serve the 7 million expatriate Bangladeshis around the world, who are considered as Biman's \"captive\" market. Well, efficiency is the name of the game in the airline business of today, and it does not end with operating the newest of airplanes. It goes deep down into managing operating costs, and none other than jet fuel represents the largest contributor of that cost. ", "Biman not only flies gas-guzzling birds like the Fokker F-28 and the McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 aircraft, it also buys very, very expensive jet fuel thanks to the country's prehistoric energy policy which levies absurdly heavy duty on jet fuel. As a result, the price of jet fuel here in Bangladesh is almost 50% higher than the current world market rates. So, while Biman does need to renew its fleet with newer airplanes, our government must also truly tune in to today's economic world and its dynamics. ", "As for the \"captive\" market of Biman, equaling to 7 million expatriate Bangladeshis, all I can say is unless Biman drastically improves its reliability (which again boils down to efficiency issues) and customer service, this presumed \"captive\" market will not stay under Biman's captivity for too long. These 7 million people, as customers, will compromise to a certain extent to fly their native national airline. ", "But the service Biman offers now is bordering  what is called \"gross,\" as evidently seen in recent examples of canceling of flights without notice, and then leaving hundreds of passengers stranded at the airport without showing any signs of responsibility and decency. Biman must quit taking its passengers for granted, unless it wants to learn the lesson the very hard way that \"customer is the king.\"  ", "Biman recently underwent restructuring process, which helped reduce its heavyweight manpower, and has transformed itself into a Limited Company from its earlier status as a Corporation. And this is only like kicking-off on a hurdles race, with numerous hurdles to get over, which is the actual part of the game. What the report by TIB sums up, and what these gentlemen stated at the conference, are the hurdles that Biman will actually have to get over. Staying put after the kick-start would not look smart, really!", "It has been stated in the reports that, after the restructuring, the government would own 100% shares of the airline and appoint a reputed international airline as its \"operator,\" who would be free from government control and have complete liberty to plan, and control the airline's operations. ", "Now, the fundamentals of management states that the planning and controlling tasks of any enterprise of any scale are like the two blades of a scissor -- one complementing the other, and ownership essentially exercises them both. I would rather believe that the moon is just a big light in the sky, than to believe that the government will own the airline wholesomely without meaning to control it in any way! ", "Another alarming statement published in different newspapers was that Biman, in its new form as a Limited Company, will have a Board of Directors consisting of bureaucrats -- largely or entirely. With due respect to the bureaucrats, I will reiterate what I had expressed in my earlier articles -- that running a commercial airline is not their job.", "It is, rather, the job of people who have experience of the industry directly or indirectly, such as the travel agency owners, bankers, management consultants, and information systems specialists. The Board of Directors at Biman should be comprised of such useful and knowledgeable people, and let the bureaucrats do their job with their broader set of responsibilities of serving the nation.", "Professor Muzaffor Ahmed, Chairman of the trustee, board of TIB, summed up the discussion saying that he and his fellow colleagues at TIB are still optimistic, despite all odds, that Biman will be able to succeed to become an airline with sustainable growth and profitability.  ", "I am an optimist, and I do believe that every cloud has a silver lining. It has been a long 35 years of wait, and we all hope the sunny times will be here soon!

Poor countries like Bangladesh can ill afford to bear the effects of the problem. As it happened, Bangladesh was unfortunately buffeted by this terrible malaise in the recent past.", "Acquiring is a basic human instinct. People acquire material resources for consumption, investment, and bequeathing purposes. Consumption is broadly defined in this write-up. It includes not only consumption of goods and services of tangible nature, but also sensual pleasures, and utility derived from charity and emotional fulfillment. The essential requirement is that one has to consciously feel that he is getting perceptible utility from such activities. ", "Investment is a benign option for using one's asset; its outcome is value addition, provision of employment, and welfare augmentation of citizens. Investors, of course, earn profit, a part of which they save for further investment. ", "The prodigal will be interested more in extravaganza and wasteful expenditure. He may squander away huge resources without understanding its social and economic implications. His activities run counter to the interest of society and people at large.", "How much money does a person need to lead a fabulously decent life in Bangladesh? I have discussed this issue with many people. If a person does not indulge in hard drinking, he can blithely maintain a family of six with a monthly income of Tk 100,000.  ", "If he is a free -- wheeler type he will need more money, but not exceeding Tk 200,000 per month at any rate. If he needs more money, he is either an extremely bad manager or a wretched sucker deserving no sympathy. ", "On the contrary, his activities are suspect and should be closely watched; they may be linked to the criminal world, as happens more often than not. With a heftily surplus income at his command, a person may soon be tempted to buy influence to protect his income and indulge in self-aggrandisement. ", "He thinks he can get away with any thing, however heinous that action may be. As he gets deeper into these unethical or illegal activities, his appetite for money and material resources is whetted beyond limit.", "Those who amass huge resources are likely to spend a part of it on undesirable activities, except a few who are endowed with intense ethical values. The latter usually prefer to spend a part of their assets on charity. This is an acceptable proposition as it is based on good intention.", "Some people develop a fixation, a mania, for acquiring money and material resources for the sake of it. They really do not know what to do with it, all they know is that they have lots of assets, and can spend as much money as possible whenever they want to.

We have heard of a first lady who collected a few thousand pairs of shoes, most of which she even did not have a chance to see. She just enjoyed the ownership.", "This sort of ownership is a dead loss to the society because no one consumes the items and no benefit is derived from them, except the perverse psychological satisfaction of the owner. One may argue that perverse satisfaction is also a kind of satisfaction that benefits at least one economic agent; so it should be counted as a positive benefit to the society. ", "This is a flawed argument in that such benefit to a maniac comes at the cost of many other individuals, who are adversely affected in the process of acquisition of wealth by the greedy exploiter. ", "Somebody may derive benefit through satisfying his criminal instinct. Such a tendency has to be arrested to protect the life and property of citizens. The acquisition instinct also should not be allowed to cross its limit, lest it turns into a social opprobrium. ", "Left to itself, an extreme acquisition instinct soon degenerates into killer instinct, oftener than not in the figurative sense, though the literary sense is not ruled out.", "It is reported in the press that some people have amassed wealth worth billions of Taka, stashed away at home and abroad. From my knowledge about the intelligence and education of some of these people, I have reasons to believe that they cannot even count five hundred sixty two thousand four hundred forty three Taka, let alone higher quantities involving millions and billions of Taka. ", "Managing a fund of this dimension is simply beyond their capacity. They trust some near and dear ones to manage it. All that they are interested in is the smooth flow of money and material whenever they need them. ", "Their prime consumption comprises acquisition of landed properties, houses, luxury flats, costly vehicles, clothes, ornaments and gizmos, and travelling abroad with friends and relatives when they go on a shopping binge. The fund managers and the cronies make sure that their whims and caprices are taken care of during their visits abroad. ", "A few industries are also established in their names, though the real management authority is exercised by their cronies. Once out of power, they soon lose control over these industries because of inadequacies and complications in the relevant documents. ", "Ownership of fabulous resources is prone to breed hubris and power hunger, which may in turn lead a person to persecute his opponents at any cost and in any manner he deems fit. ", "In extreme cases, he is ready to annihilate the rock-ribbed opponents. Acquisition of enormous wealth is, therefore, a potential source of big crime in the country.", "In Europe, particularly in the Scandinavian countries, a movement has started for limiting the acquisition of wealth by an individual. The corporate executives who draw a staggering amount of compensation are the targets of this campaign.

The company and the society would be greatly benefited if the compensation package could be appropriately shaved off to a really necessary level. A similar line of thinking is discernible in China as well. ", "Some political caucus has started questioning the extravaganza, which is demonstrated by the filthily rich people in that country.

Hu also praised the exercises and said: \"I am convinced that the current exercise will definitely serve to stimulate the SCO to play a bigger role in the struggle against terrorism in the region.\" The SCO on 16 August sent NATO a thinly coded warning at its summit, saying the world must let the region resolve its own security. The West has been jockeying with regional powers Russia and China for influence over the energy-rich area.", "Russia said that the aim of the operation is  freeing of the territory controlled by the terrorists and the destruction of the illegal group of terrorists if they fail to surrender. One fact is glaringly revealed in this joint-exercise by these UNSC-5 members: Russia is fully awakened to reassert it superpower status and once again sends cold warning to US-led NATO about its missile placement in East Europe. Since the collective security system by the CIS nations led by Russia is a weak agency to counter NATO effectively, Russia has decided to use SCO.

Those who seek power, individuals and/or political groupings, have their own objectives, not dissimilar to the agenda of a superpower and/or a neighbour.", "Take, for example, the present governance team of President Gen Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz. In the face of political boondoggling of the elected PMs, Musharraf was the preference of many voters in the years immediately following 1999, even without the exercise of a mandate. ", "He preferred to remain in power not through an electoral process, which at that time he could have conceivably got, but through the source of his power, the Pakistan army. ", "In an indirect way, but with considerable manipulation and rigging, the voters did give him a sanction of sorts in late 2002. Gerrymandering the vote is not a Pakistani phenomenon alone, it is the done thing in most third world countries. Indeed, as we saw in the US presidential elections in 2000, voter manipulation is alive and well in the first world too, whenever it is required to display its ugly manifestation.", "Having ventured into the realm of politics, Musharraf had to rely on political partners Ch Shujaat Hussain, Altaf Hussain, etc, as well as a bevy of elements like PPP forward bloc and independents, not excluding the grudging support of the religious parties. After 9/11, he placed an overwhelming reliance on the US; in Pakistan which leader has not, particularly when it was willingly forthcoming? Political groupings pursue a given ideology, this one ranged from the left of liberal to the right extreme, the politics of convenience. ", "To give credence to his version of \"democracy,\" Musharraf chose Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali, a PML leader of long standing, with the blessings of his political allies. This was in the face of his preference for a technocrat, particularly Shaukat Aziz, brought back from Citibank HQ in New York to be the finance minister in his first cabinet.

He had already mastered the art of political \"client-patron\" relationship he first learnt during his banking career.

The uniformed client has been very \"lucky\" in multiplying his investment through \"sound advice,\" and a little \"bit of help,\" very much like bureaucrats were made to win at cards in the 50s and 60s. As a fairly wealthy individual himself, money and greed has never been his weakness, despite the occasional grumblings of the political machine he has managed to survive (and survive with some political dignity) till the end of his term.", "For Mian Nawaz Sharif, his dream team consisted of having a hand picked president who would be amenable to all his requirements. Rafiq Tarar, the man from nowhere, was installed to fill the bill, even though Sharif had stalwarts within the party he could have turned to, the odds-on-choice being Senator Sartaj Aziz, his foreign minister and Secretary General PML. In the end Rafiq Tarar let him down, not even entering a mild protest when Musharraf overthrew the government.", "Rafiq Tarar himself was eventually shown the door, in his case being shown off at the door by Musharraf, literally. For Benazir, her acceptance of Ghulam Ishaq Khan as president turned into a nightmare, he virtually emasculated her governance, and then threw her out, using the army to cover his dirty deed. Her choice of Farooq Leghari as a safe president soured in 1997 when he, in his turn, sent her packing.", "The only president-PM combination that has lasted its life in office is that of Musharraf and Shaukat. This dream team was very much the choice of the US, and that support was vital for its longevity. However, one thing rankles American democratic sensibilities, Musharraf and Shaukat Aziz were not elected in the pure democratic sense, they were actually selected, Musharraf by circumstances and Shaukat Aziz by Musharraf. It would be crass to deny that this horses for courses team has succeeded at least in the economic sense.", "Even without a political constituency, Shaukat has been a consummate politician. To have survived three years in the political labyrinth of Pakistan, keeping both the army and the bureaucracy happy, and the political wolves from his door, has been no mean achievement. ", "Observers have also noted that none of the political leaders, including the two major opposition figures, Ms Benazir and Mian Nawaz Sharif have shown any visceral hatred for Shaukat Aziz, as opposed to their feelings towards Musharraf (and towards each other). Was it because he, as their private banker, knows too much?", "Musharraf would be happy if the present combination continues. If he is forced to accept a political PM who comes to the seat of power in free and fair elections, Shaukat will probably replace Mohammad Mian Soomro as chairman senate, one heartbeat from the presidency. On the other hand, Shaukat Aziz could well continue as PM if no political party emerges with outright majority, a compromise choice for all seasons.", "What happens if, for some reason, the Supreme Court of Pakistan decides that Musharraf cannot fight the presidential elections while in uniform? Will Musharraf risk the electoral process out of uniform? In the face of leaving the post of the president and the COAS Pakistan army, which one will Musharraf choose? ", "Faced with the choice of fighting the elections in \"civvies\" or looking for a safe exit, anyone in Musharraf's position (and given his personality) will take the former option. On the other hand, there is that outside chance of his going the \"Pinochet\" route by retaining the COAS slot, remaining the power behind the throne. This calls for the president's slot being occupied by whom he considers most loyal, the bonus being that person being also preferable to everyone, and mainly the US.", "Power-sharing between an elected president and a PM will always have a third partner in Pakistan, the triad being completed by the COAS.

And they do so because the present happens to be an era when you are literally bombarded with such new inventions as GPAs and various other grades, many of which quite escape you, in terms of meaning and nuance. That is because of the particular academic legacy you are heir to. ", "When people like us went to school and college, and that was in the 1960s and 1970s, there was a simple method of marking in examinations that was followed by our teachers. We were not graded in the way today's generation of the young are. But we did follow a system where division was all that mattered. The good students among us came away from their examinations with a first division. And after them came those with the seconds and the thirds. ", "There were times when a student gathering a cumulative total of first division marks failed one subject and so needed a few grace marks to be able to get through. When that happened, sadly enough, his position swiftly went down to a third division. And, of course, there were a whole lot of other people who failed overall and, thus, had to go for a second attempt a year later, if they were so inclined.", "The beauty of the old system was that a clear differentiation in merit was noticeable through the marks. It was a sense of competition that mattered. A student coming by 68 percent of marks in his English papers at the HSC examinations generally felt disappointed that he was still behind another, who had managed to score 69 percent. ", "And that kind of score in English was, and remains, almost a record where school and college level education in this country is concerned. The upshot of it was that scores of students could obtain first division marks, but despite this sort of uniformity there were yet the many differences in scores that separated one student from another.", "There were other pretty positive aspects of SSC and HSC examinations as well in that era. To go through a subject successfully, one needed to obtain a minimum of 33 percent of marks in the examinations. Anything less was considered a failure. If the score was far below 33 per cent, the admissibility of grace marks simply did not arise. But if the gap between 33 and the actual score was small, there was a good possibility that the candidate would pull through. ", "Another pretty interesting aspect of examinations in those days was the broad questions. It was, now that we think of it, an extremely efficacious way of testing the student's intellect. The argument in those days was that objective questions, or questions that called for short, precise answers, were not really a credible way of judging the ability of a student. And that was a reason why students were made to go through the entirety of their syllabi as they prepared for the examinations.", "But all those realities are, today, tales of a past that people in these present times would rather do without. Where, in the old days, guardians proudly informed relatives and friends of the letters and star marks their children had achieved at the examinations, today it is all a question of a GPA and a certain number attached to it. ", "For those steeped in old methods of living, among which is clearly a traditional, almost fanatical, devotion to old methods of examination, such a manner of scoring is something that is not quite comprehensible. Some may even be willing and ready to inform you that it is clearly unacceptable. ", "Whether or not you accept the new, or recall with fondness the system that once nurtured you, is a different matter altogether. But what you most certainly will have reservations about is the rapidity with which education in Bangladesh has taken a new dimension altogether in the last few years. ", "In the first place, the bang with which private universities came into the academic scene over the last decade, or slightly more, has made the ground shift somewhat where students' perceptions of their future is concerned. Almost all of these universities have placed regular, repeated, and increased emphasis on a study of essentially two subjects, namely, information technology and business administration.", "Go for a survey around the trend and you will be surprised how vast the number of young people raring to go for academic courses in these two areas, but especially business administration, has been compared to those who have veered off into other areas of education. What has been happening is that education in all these years has pushed students into a sense of awareness about their career prospects once they finish higher education.", "And do you see how a careerist approach to education has, in a way, stifled the bigger goals that academia has always been known for? Let us not waste words. The unambiguous truth is that in all this expansion of education, in all this exciting turn toward syllabi that prepare the young for an assured career, it is liberal education that has died a slow and painful death. There are those among you who just might be tempted to suggest that liberal education is in a bad state of coma. ", "But look around you, and you will know that what you have before you is something of a brain-dead educational base that once, in its thriving form, so amply turned out idealists, dreamers, indeed people who not only shaped a view of what life ought to be but also strove hard to forge a worldview for themselves. And that was done through a long, hard study of such subjects as literature, political science, philosophy, history, indeed the entire gamut of social sciences. ", "That is not what you have now. There are not many private sector universities, which can make you feel happy with their attitude to the study of literature. That is when you know that a good number of these universities do not have departments that can help to satisfy your intellectual curiosity about life in the world and beyond. ", "If there is one glaring scratch that information technology has caused society in general, it has been to dampen, or outright kill, the urge for a pursuit of liberal education in the country. Yes, surely IT has worked wonders through essentially helping people discover newer truths about themselves and about their place in the universal scheme of things. ", "It has brought the diverse regions of the globe closer together. But then, closeness is not always a recipe for happiness. Distances not only make the heart grow fonder but also keep alive the sense of mystery that has impelled generations into an insistent pursuit of the unknown for centuries.  ", "The old idea of mystery is gone. And pursuit of the unknown has, to our discomfiture, come to something of a screeching halt. The enlightened principal of a school in this city once asked a student, a teenaged girl, why she seemed apathetic to a study of history. \"Look,\" said the girl in tones that bordered on the uncouth and the rude, \"history is about the past. We live in the present. Why must we be bothered about the past?\"", "Does that say anything to you, to me, to anyone who has had an old-fashioned point of view about education being a lighthouse in our exploration of the universe?"], "tag": ["Editorial"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=1795", "location": null, "date": "2007-08-29"}

Lailatul Baraat is not merely about a nightlong remembrance of the Lord of the Universe to be followed by days of business as usual. Indeed, it is a reminder to people everywhere that truth and justice, a sense of fellow-feeling among people everywhere, and overall the acknowledgement of the conviction that we are all brothers on the earth together, brothers who know they are truly brothers, are what really matter. Lailatul Baraat is about recalling our ancestors who once walked the earth and praying for the salvation of their souls. It is a point in time when we need to help the poor. And as we help the poor, we also know in the core of our being that it remains the collective task of men and women to create for themselves a caring, well-meaning, purposeful and enlightened society. Each of us, as individuals, can complement another and thereby construct a chain that will lead to a wholesome human linkage attuned to the higher calling of the Almighty.

The negative connotations that have unfortunately and unjustifiably come to be associated with their faith as a result of the rise of fanaticism in their midst is a strong message that Islam needs to reassert itself as a religion of peace. In simple terms, the message ought to be without ambiguity -- that on Lailatul Baraat Muslims everywhere pledge to redeem themselves in line with the noble teachings of their faith and put themselves to a constant test through practising those teachings."], "tag": ["Editorial"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=1792", "location": null, "date": "2007-08-29"}

Particularly, under the currently unique dispensation, one would have thought that the media's role would be taken in the right perspective, the criticisms more objectively.

", "The grim export statistics followed growths of over 19 percent in knitwears and 14 percent in wovenwears beyond the EPB projection in 2005-06.

An incident between army personnel and students on Dhaka University campus erupted into a major show of disenchantment with the government. Only a short while ago, this government enjoyed unprecedented public support.", "What could have led to such a drastic change? In his address to the nation, the chief adviser attributed the disturbances to the efforts by certain quarters who were taking advantage of a minor event to destabilise and discredit the government. This explanation is not too different from the excuses used by governments in the past whenever they were unable to contain violence on the streets. However, the sabotage of communication cable around the same time in a remote area of Chittagong and the images on television of men on rampage who appeared to be non-students lend some credence to the chief adviser's claim.", "An overview of recent developments and the style of governing can provide insight into the causes that contributed to the severe outburst of dissatisfaction. Earlier in the year, the government received strong support for helping the country get out of an extremely difficult situation. The citizens heaved a sigh of relief at being rescued from the tyranny of strikes and violent clashes between supporters of political parties who competed to demonstrate strong muscle power at every opportunity.", "Leaders of the Awami League were delighted at the turn of events, extended full support to the government, and claimed credit for bringing the new government into power. They were delighted with the arrest of a number of leaders from the rival BNP, and did not protest too strongly about same fate of some of their own party leaders. The government decided to come down hard on corruption, and raised the hope of Bangladeshis by putting behind bars some of the most powerful lawbreakers. No tear was shed for the arrested and absconding corrupt people, and work was progressing on the arrangements for holding free and fair elections. ", "The government became overzealous in fighting corruption, and neglected the critical task of governing the country. Food prices spiraled, law and order deteriorated, and floods affected the purchasing power and employment prospect of millions of people. Ruthless eviction of hawkers with no arrangement for rehabilitation added to the ranks of the dissatisfied. On the political front, there were hints of impatience as political parties were not allowed to function, and they were unable to play a role in assisting with the governing process. It was impossible for a group of eleven advisers, however capable, to deal with the numerous problems that descended upon Bangladesh within a very short time. ", "Instead of rearranging the priorities in view of the changing circumstances, the government pushed forward with the mission of \"cleaning up\" the political system. Fresh rounds of arrests brought in new interns, the most notable being Sheikh Hasina. Statements from an adviser hinting the leaders of Jamaat-e-Islami to be free from corruption and stern warnings from another adviser to prevent corrupt politicians from returning to power even before they were convicted, weakened the position of the government. The government was losing its impartial status, and the perception was strengthened by the apparently biased way in which the allegedly corrupt people were treated.", "Confidence slid further as it was revealed that Khaleda Zia and Saifur Rahman had not declared a substantial part of their income for years. In spite of clear instructions that close relatives of arrested or allegedly corrupt people would not be allowed to pay a penalty on back taxes and get exemption from prosecution, both the former prime minister and her finance minister were allowed to do so. It is common knowledge that members of both families are alleged to be severely corrupt. It has also been reported that Saifur Rahman not only condoned corruption among his family members, he is also accused of using public funds to decorate his villa in Moulavi Bazar, and persuading the government to build a connecting road from the highway for his benefit.", "Students have genuine reason to be dissatisfied, as they suffered the most over the years. Completion of education takes much longer than planned, and students are exploited for serving the interests of political parties. Corruption in the Public Service Commission precludes the possibility of employment after graduation and adds to the frustration of students and their families. While students have been sacrificing their career to fight for the interest of political parties, they do not receive anything in return. No government has made sincere efforts to identify the needs of the students with the intention of addressing them.", "As the caretaker government started the campaign against corruption, there was high expectation among students that those responsible for damaging the universities and educational institutions would be brought to task. Several vice-chancellors appointed on political considerations are alleged to have committed massive corruption. Excepting one or two of the former vice-chancellors who are absconding, the others seem to be enjoying immunity from prosecution and they have been allowed to return to their original posts. ", "How can students have trust in a government that chooses not to prosecute corrupt people in the universities, while coming down hard on a select group of politicians? What are the reasons for according special treatment to former vice-chancellors who committed corruption? A government must not only be fair, but must also be seen to be fair.", "Reports in the media are harbinger of worse to come. The personnel deployed to enforce curfew regulations seem to be out of control. Citizens, including media workers and students trying to reach home after getting evicted from dormitories, are receiving harsh treatment from the security personnel.  It would be good for the government to rein the overzealous security personnel in, and bear in mind that such treatment of students on Dhaka University campus triggered the crisis.", "The government has taken some steps in the right direction. The withdrawal of army camp from the university was swift and the decision to apologise for the unfortunate incident appropriate. The relaxation of curfew for longer hours reflects a mature approach, but it needs to be withdrawn completely.", "Some measures can be suggested to help defuse the tension. The first and foremost task is to bring back normalcy in the life of citizens. Curfew and constant harassment by security personnel is not normal. If the government has specific information on the \"instigators\" of disturbance, they should be promptly taken into custody. That will make it possible to withdraw the curfew and allow people to resume normal life.", "The formation of commissions to conduct enquiries is known to the public as a strategy used to buy time and wait for the crisis to pass. The current situation calls for a different approach. As a state of emergency is in force, it should be possible to conduct a quick trial and hand down appropriate punishment to the person who were instrumental in triggering the crisis. This act will demonstrate the willingness of the government to adopt tough measures to protect the interest of students as well as establish firm control over security personnel who step out of line.", "The next task should be to restore the confidence of the citizens in the government. This requires a demonstration of fairness in dealing with corruption. If the government is serious about combating corruption, all allegations must be carefully investigated and all leaders accused of corruption should be treated in the same manner. Support from the citizens has dwindled as they witnessed differential treatment for those alleged to be corrupt. ", "It is believed that anger directed at the government emanated from the frustration of people affected by the constantly increasing price of essential commodities. This problem needs to be addressed and placed high on the list of government priorities. The government will have to work in collaboration with traders and retailers to resolve the crisis. The business community can be a vital partner in the process. If necessary, the government should be prepared to inject substantial amount of money as well as logistic support to ensure adequate supply and reasonable prices. This is critical for the government to regain public confidence.", "Finally, this is an opportunity to bring about improvements in the system of higher education and employment prospects of students.

They concluded that Germany's context is very different from Bangladesh and therefore the examples are irrelevant. They argue that open-pit mines are environmentally disastrous. ", "They have also assumed that Asia Energy has influenced The Daily Star to file these reports by organising and paying for the trip to Germany at a time when the government is formulating a coal mining policy. I believe this calls for a clarification for the benefit of all the readers. ", "Firstly, The Daily Star did not accept any expense from Asia Energy and paid fully for the travel and hotel expenses of its correspondent. I admit that the biggest fault of my reports was that I had not talked to any aggrieved person in Germany whose life had been affected by the open-pit mines. I also did not talk to opposing political or environmental activists. My four-day program was designed by Asia Energy in collaboration with German mining company RWE. While such a pre-planned visit allows maximum utilisation of time, it always leaves out some vital aspects. This deprived the readers of some essential viewpoints.", "Despite this shortcoming, I believe my reports have been objective. I felt that I have enough information to share with our readers that there is a good example of open-pit mining -- and before we \"ban\" this method of mining, we should have a second look into the issue. ", "Asia Energy invited The Daily Star to report on the German mine at a time when coal policy is being formulated with a view to pointing out the German experience before the policy is finalised. This is not an unusual practice. As long as it is done openly and in public view, we can live with it. When the Barapukuria deal was made, nobody invited the press or bothered about public opinion. ", "The Daily Star did not whimsically choose to accept Asia Energy's invitation as the company is in the centre of a controversy. It sponsored the trip because it believed that there will be some genuine learning by visiting some of the world's best mines and that there will be new knowledge and experience to share with our readers. As a reporter, I was so conscious about what Asia Energy's agenda was that I explicitly mentioned in the report what its stakes were. ", "Some individuals mix up open-pit mining concept with Asia Energy's interest. While this is true that Asia Energy proposed open-pit mining in Phulbari, this is not true that Asia Energy holds the copyright for such mining in Bangladesh. Open-pit mining method was not discovered by Asia Energy. Talking in favour of open pit mining is not synonymous to favouring Asia Energy. ", "Open pit mining is a hundred plus years old method that enables large-scale extraction of coal -- and thereby significantly reduce the per ton coal production cost.  If open-pit mining of the Phulbari coal zone is the sole reason for opposing Asia Energy -- I vehemently oppose such mindset. If Asia Energy's Phulbari proposal goes against national interest, let's dissect it technically and politically and then trash it. ", "None of my reports said that open-pit mines are environment friendly. In fact all mines --underground or open-pit -- are threats to environment. BEN should investigate what's going on in Barapukuria's environment and balance its views. ", "The scale of environmental damage is proportional. In underground mines, the production is low and the proportion of environment damage is also low -- if badly planned. In open pits, the production is very high and the proportion of environmental damage is very high -- if badly planned.  In both cases, damage is mainly done in handling the underground water tables. If carelessly discharged, the water from any coal mine will have some negative impact. ", "A Bangladeshi geologist from US wrote in The Daily Star that the residual lakes created in Germany after an open-pit mine is complete cannot have fisheries because of presence of harmful heavy metal and other chemicals. I beg to differ. These lakes have fisheries and used by the public as recreational resorts. People are swimming there and you can see the fish. They have applied proper hydro-engineering to achieve this level of safety. But the water is not used for drinking -- as its not completely safe. Time will make it completely safe. I would like to point out that irresponsible mining has damaged many water bodies and rivers in countries like the US. Despite a lot of measures, coal mines still do have its pitfalls.", "This is why we should learn from the best practices.  We need the coal for our energy security. We don't want to spend Tk 1,600 crore for a mine like Barapukuria, then keep on importing coal to run a small 250 mw power plant, and then entirely waste 22 million cubic metres of polluted waters each year turning the whole mining area dangerously dry. We don't want to produce coal that will cost us $90 per ton. We don't want to ignore the fact that even in Barapukuria's \"safe\" underground mine area, land is subsiding and potable water is becoming out of the community's reach. ", "In following the best underground mining practices, we must remember even in Germany -- which is known for one of the best mining related environmental practices -- underground coal mining is so expensive that it needs subsidy. This is why Germany's shares of underground mining for hard coal is shrinking. By 2018, Germany will close down all its underground hard coal mines -- while maintaining 100 million tons of lignite coal mining from open pit mines.", "Put aside Asia Energy's proposal, and start to consider that Bangladesh can develop open-pit mine, if it is possible technically and if that can be done through compensating for human resettlement and by addressing environmental issues. Let's start from the Dighipara coal mine -- against which Petrobangla has submitted a proposal. I assure you, if Petrobangla drills as many test wells as Asia Energy and has its feasibility study professionally done -- investment will not be a problem. Energy is precious around the world. ", "What is our extra benefit from open-pit mines? For example, Germany's open-pit lignite coal mine is so cost effective that the latest (2005) 1,000 megawatt power plant generates power at less than 1 Euro cent (1.25 US cent) per kilowatt hour! This is even cheaper than the Meghnaghat power. ", "Because of very low coal production rate, underground mines will not save us from our upcoming power crisis. But coal will not only give us thousands of megawatts of power, it will give us clean synthetic petroleum -- which presently costs less than $30 per ton --and meet our 3.5 million ton petroleum per annum petroleum demand. Coal is also the source of many types of chemicals and paints. Surely, once we open our horizons, we will be able to explore those fields. Large-scale production does not necessarily imply encouraging export of coal. ", "Personally, I oppose Asia Energy's proposal, mainly from financial aspect because I have always believed Bangladesh is not getting fair financial return in the deal. After seeing the German experience, I realized what was missing from the Phulbari proposal -- it excluded Bangladesh's ownership. Indeed, successful mining companies like RWE or Tata are home-grown. Why can't we have a policy regime to encourage a home-grown company in which private companies may participate, but not hold the ownership of the resources? ", "Let us learn from the experience of Coal India, the world's largest coal producer -- which used to be a local private company that was nationalised in 1973 and then in the early nineties saw private involvement again. ", "I strongly believe that giving Phulbari away to Asia Energy just like that would be disastrous. If Phulbari zone is awarded to any coal mining company for execution, Bangladesh must be the large stakeholder in this deal. As a nation, we have the sovereign right to cancel or modify any deal to suit our national interest. My reports have in fact emphasised this point strongly. ", "According to the World Coal Institute, there are two types of underground mines and just one type of open pit mines.", "In underground mining, Room and Pillar style mining allows a maximum extraction of 40% of coal in the seam. The other approach is Longwall Mining, which uses mechanical shearers to fully extract coal from a section of the seam. A longwall face requires careful planning to ensure favourable geology exists throughout the section before development work begins. Over 75% of the coal in the deposit can be extracted from panels of coal that can extend 3km through the coal seam.", "Geologists say the highest possible coal production from an underground mine, anywhere around the world, is 5 million tons a year. There are very few Longwall underground mines around the world, because this kind of mine is possible in a very limited geological situation. ", "The World Coal Institute says that open cut or surface mining is only economic when the coal seam is near the surface. This method recovers a higher proportion of the coal deposit than underground mining as all coal seams are exploited -- 90% or more of the coal can be recovered.", "Geologists say that presently an open-pit mine allow annual coal production of 40 million tons. And if there is enough demand, such a mine could produce more. ", "Coal production figures of Indian Coal, that operates both underground and open-pit mines, show that its open-pit mines produce more than six times the coal produced in underground mines. In 2005-06, Coal India produced 45.82 million tons from underground mines and 297.57 million tons from open-pit mines.", "This shows that open-pit mining produces maximum coal. Bangladesh is an energy starved, very low energy consuming country in the country. The supply of our staple source of energy gas is set to decline from 2011. But our power demand forecast is high. ", "I am not a \"supporter\" of open-pit mining. My argument is that we keep our minds open, and take the best approach that will benefit us most economically, socially and environmentally. If we must meet our power and energy demands, we cannot depend on small scale mines. We need to produce coal that will help us meet our demands. This is why I am opposed to the thought that open-pit mining should be banned out of hand. Open-pit mines can produce high volume of coal at a given time, which the underground mines can not. Let me reiterate, if the current technologies do not allow open-pit mines in our country safely, I withdraw my case."], "tag": ["OP-ED"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=1529", "location": null, "date": "2007-08-27"}

Till the end of 20th century no international evaluation of Nazrul was done, but in 21st century we find an excellent evaluation titled Kazi Nazrul Islam: The Voice of Poetry and the Struggle for Human Wholeness by Winston E. Langley of Massachusetts University, USA. For the first time, a western scholar has evaluated Nazrul, considering the international situation of 21st century. He has compared Nazrul with the greatest poets, thinkers and philosophers of all times. In the conclusion of the book, Langley remarks, \u201cThe book has sought to acquaint its readers with one of the most remarkable poets of all times and likewise with one of the world's most morally provoking artists of the twentieth century. Additionally, he is perhaps the most prolific composer the world has come to know. Taken together, what I hope the eight chapters have shown, is a human being whose thinking touched on almost every major aspect of human concerns.\u201d I think that Langley's evaluation will change the course of the academic research on Nazrul being pursued in the subcontinent and will herald a new international vision to judge Nazrul's contribution. ", "Dr. Rafiqul Islam: I started my research on Nazrul in the late '50s. At the very outset, I went to Kolkata and interviewed people who had known Nazrul during different periods. The results of these interviews disheartened me because by then most of them had been rendered incapable of proper recollection. Meanwhile, I got a Fulbright scholarship to Cornell University for higher studies in Linguistics. Returning home I prepared an exhaustive bibliography of Nazrul's writings and compositions both chronologically and alphabetically that Bangla Academy published in 1970 as ", "Then I started tracing Nazrul's life based on facts and documents rather then popular legends and hearsay.

I feel this is high time to rewrite the poet's biography and publish it not only for the general readers, but also for the new generation of researchers. I consider it to be my sacred duty to present a biography of this great poet whom I have discovered through his works and creations supported by valid documents.

When the existence of languages and cultures of the disadvantaged nations are at stake, life and works of nationalist revolutionary poets and thinkers like Nazrul can show us the way to uphold our heritage, traditions, values and ethnic uniqueness. From Nazrul we can learn how to combine nationalist values with international ideas. We can guard our national identity following Nazrul's way of thinking, resisting the external aggression on our culture. ", "Nazrul has not been translated widely. There have been English translations mostly by Indian and Bangladeshi translators. Though there have been attempts to translate Nazrul's work into Russian, Chinese, Japanese, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Farsi, Urdu, Hindi and Tamil, Nazrul has yet to receive a proper global exposure. We have not yet been successful in motivating the few western translators who understand Bangla. Apart from that, most of our English scholars are apathetic towards Nazrul. Probably they consider him as \u201csubaltern\u201d, rather than a major poet of the first half of twentieth century.", "We can stir their interest initially through Nazrul's music. Our electronic media features only a few artistes who repeat a limited number of songs throughout the year. Had there been a conscious effort by the artistes and the media to introduce the audience to the variety and richness of Nazrul's creations, I'm sure our young music lovers would have been more interested in Nazrul. That would eventually convince them to study others forms of Nazrul's works like poetry, novels, short stories, and essays. It is also the responsibility of the parents and the schools to motivate our young ones to read Nazrul and to sing his songs.

He recently underwent an ankle surgery, on his left leg, and expectedly Flintoff didn't bowl at the nets this morning. A massage on his ankle and some hopping exercises on the wobble-ball were followed by a batting session against both spin and pace. He didn't appear in too much pain while batting but didn't look entirely at ease either.", "\"He's very keen to play,\" said Moores after the practice session. \"He's missed a lot of cricket and wants to go out there but we need to balance it over a long series. They [the medical staff] have looked at the injury and there's no major concern with it long term. If we know there's no risk of him playing, we'll take it. If we think it's more sensible to miss a game than carry on after, we'll do that. We'll see in the morning, if it's settled down, if the swelling is gone ...\"", "India will no doubt be lifted by his absence and Mahendra Singh Dhoni, their vice-captain, said as much. \"He's a kind of player who always has an impact on the game - the perfect allrounder. He comes in as a third seamer during the field restrictions, then bowls three overs in the middle and comes back at the death. If he's not playing I think the England team will be slightly on the back foot.\"", "Ultimately, as Moores himself admitted, it may come down to Flintoff himself. \"It's a very tough decision. He's played a lot of cricket, he knows his body. You trust a player to a degree and then take all opinions or whatever. He is keen to play but also knows what's there to come. And he doesn't want to miss out on that. So between Fred, myself and the medical team we'll have to work it out.\"", "The anti-inflammatory injection was a precautionary measure, said Moores, going on to explain the sequence of events. \"He had a little bit of pain after the first game. Nothing major, a little bit of soreness. Afterwards he stiffened up and was sore in the night. It's sensible to get it checked out, doesn't seem to be any major structural thing.", "\"He saw the specialist and he said, 'It looks ok'. It's a bit of precaution measure which Fred was happy with. It would settle it down quickly. The physio seems to think it's all gone very well. Everything's positive today but we'll have to wait and see tomorrow.\"", "The tone seems to be one of guarded optimism.

Gul's first bid in April was blocked by the secular elite, which includes army generals, opposition leaders and judges, because of his past in political Islam. Elections were necessitated in Turkey because of the turmoil following the opposition by the so-called secular people to stall Gul's accession to presidency. His opponents are also objecting to the fact that his wife wears a scarf over her head. ", "An ally of USA and a Nato member, Turkey is also a candidate for EU membership. Turkey has undergone key reforms in order to enter the EU. Under a Gul presidency, Turkey will hopefully continue to combine tolerance with tradition. This would open the way for secularism in the Islamic world that concerns itself with protecting individual freedom and pluralism instead of being preoccupied with debates over issues such as headscarves. ", "Turkey's election of a conservative Muslim president need not be seen as a deviation from its secular ideals. It is a much-needed embrace of a path different from that of radical Islam as well as radical secularism. The current office-holder, Ahmet Necdet Sezer, is the 10th president since May 16, 2000, whose term  expired on May 16, but he will act as president until a successor has been chosen.", "The founder of modern Turkey, Ataturk, was an army officer who established the republic in 1923 after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, giving the vote to women, restricting Islamic dress, and replacing the Arabic script with the Roman alphabet. Wearing an Islamic headscarf, as Gul's wife does, is illegal in government offices and schools. But Islam remains a powerful and attractive alternative for many Turks in this predominantly Muslim nation of more than 70 million.", "For too long, the Muslim world has been polarized between secularists who want all public manifestations of Islamic religion banished from their countries and Islamists who insist on reverting to the Islamic way of life. This polarization cannot come to an end without secularists approving the practice of religion. ", "Although the AK Party grew out of a succession of Islamist parties banned by Turkish courts, it describes itself as a moderate conservative party rather than an Islamist one. Although both Erdogan and Gul are practicing Muslims who were once active in the Islamist movement, their first stint in office reflected an effort to distance themselves from Islamist politics. Under Erdogan, Turkey pursued European Union membership, maintained close ties with the United States and Israel, and attained new levels of economic prosperity.", " "], "tag": ["Editorial"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=1535", "location": null, "date": "2007-08-27"}

Its roots lie in the way the \"123 agreement\" was negotiated, without any political leaders being consulted.", "Opposition to the deal is widespread. But it was only when the Left published its critique of the \"123\" text on August 7 that matters came to a head. ", "An ugly confrontation might yet have been avoided, but for two events. First, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh challenged the Left to withdraw support to the UPA in an interview with the Kolkata-based Telegraph. ", "Second, a US State Department spokesperson reportedly said that \"all nuclear cooperation (would be) terminated\" if India conducted nuclear tests. This was one day after Dr. Singh said that testing wouldn't cause sudden termination.", "The second event created confusion; the first provoked the Left. Dr. Singh insulted it, and said: \"It is an honourable deal \u2026if (the Left parties) want to withdraw support, so be it\u2026\" ", "Dr. Singh's self-styled advisers had calculated that this would help him play off CPM West Bengal \"moderates\" against central \"hardliners.\" This betrayed a serious misunderstanding of how the Left parties make policies. It also underrated the unanimity among them on foreign policy. The Left's reaction was ballistic. Within three days, Dr. Singh was suing for peace.", "Thus began the worst-ever crisis in UPA-Left relations. The Left now says there'll be \"serious consequences\" if the government doesn't suspend talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency and Nuclear Suppliers' Group.", "Without the Left's support, the UPA will fall short of a parliamentary majority by 30 to 50 seats. ", "Instead of negotiating a via-media, the UPA deviously resorted to accusing the Left of acting at China's and Pakistan's behest. This tendentious charge was articulated through pro-US China-Pakistan-baiters masquerading as \"experts.\" ", "In reality, there's no live contact between the Left and the Chinese communists, about some of whose policies the Left has serious misgivings. ", "India is now witnessing the most vicious attack on the Left since the 1962 China War. Every semi-literate television anchor, former intelligence spook, and third-edit writer is spouting vitriolic anti-communism. This new McCarthyism betrays malignant intolerance.", "Such intolerance is dangerous. If every dissenting opinion is attributed to a \"foreign hand,\" and if every difference on principle is reduced to an \"ego clash,\" there can be no rational policy discourse. That does not bode well for democracy.", "It's undeniable that the Left represents India's most important ideology-driven current, which perhaps concentrates more brainpower per capita than any other. Despite the Left's conduct in Singur and Nandigram -- which this writer has strongly criticised -- its strategic objections to the deal cannot be dismissed.", "The nuclear deal is inseparable from the US game plan to recruit India into a junior partnership, not least to counter China, and broadly, to create another anchor for a Washington-dominated Asian security architecture. ", "The deal cannot be divorced from the June 2005 Defence Framework agreement, from India's two votes against Iran at the IAEA, nor from the 27 recent high-level military exercises with the US.", "The Left's critique of the deal is foundational, and centred on the US's destabilising world role and attempt to ignite a second Cold War by encircling Russia and targeting China and Iran through \"Son-of-Star-Wars\" ballistic missile defence. The US remains the globe's most belligerent power. It has made the world more insecure through its Empire project.", "True, the Left didn't consistently emphasise the deal's strategic dimensions, and often concentrated on its text rather than context. It was, until recently, more concerned about highlighting differences between the Hyde Act and Singh's assurances to Parliament. It also didn't publicly agitate the issue. ", "Any genuine, principled, opposition to the deal should logically focus on its harmful consequences for nuclear disarmament, and its promotion of an inappropriate, costly, hazardous, and environmentally unsound energy trajectory through nuclear power -- besides loss of India's strategic and foreign policy autonomy via a strategic embrace of the US. These are errors of omission.", "However, the government's errors of commission are graver. Singh acted like a typical bureaucrat, and left the deal's negotiation to bureaucrats alone. He fomented the illusion that the deal would offer a magic bullet for India's energy problems. ", "He capitulated to US pressure on Iran. Former US assistant secretary of state Stephen Rademaker says India's anti-Iran votes were obtained through \"coercion.\" ", "Dr. Singh still pays lip-service to disarmament, but knows fully well that the deal will enable India to stockpile 1,600 kg of plutonium every year -- enough for more than 300 bombs, in addition to the existing estimated inventory of 100-150 warheads. This will trigger a nuclear arms race with Pakistan, and worse, China, reducing the security of all.", "It would be foolish of the UPA it to brazen out of its present crisis of survival. It can still rescue the situation by doing four things. The first is to distance itself strategically from Washington -- minimally, by cancelling future military exercises with the US and its allies. ", "Second, it should initiate what might be called a \"domestic Hyde Act\" to prevent the transfer of any imported nuclear material/equipment out of India, which would jeopardise the continuous operation of Indian reactors. ", "Third, the UPA must update the 1988 Rajiv Gandhi plan for global nuclear disarmament and place it before the United Nations. That would concretely fulfil the National Common Minimum Programme's pledge that India would seize \"leadership\" in fighting for a nuclear weapons-free world. ", "Finally, the UPA must launch a national debate on nuclear power, reviewing India's (unhappy) experience with it, analysing its international performance, and focusing on its hazards, costs and (un)sustainability. ", "Meanwhile, the UPA must suspend all negotiations on the deal. Similarly, the Left must categorically state that it won't vote against the government and in no other way help the BJP.

Indeed, the spontaneity, spread, and intensity of the event has few parallels in our recent history. ", "It spread like a prairie fire, engulfing in its flames the entire country, while the student community was gripped by a spasmodic hysteria. When the rampage stopped, it left a deep scar on the face of the nation and the establishment. Already exasperated with multiple problems, they are trying to understand what it was all about.", "However, it goes to the credit of the authorities that they played it cool, and reacted fast and responsibly before it could snowball into yet another national crisis. Now that the storm has blown over, the people at the helm are expected to do a bit of introspection and soul-searching to pinpoint what was it due to. ", "Was the trivial incident at the university gymnasium alone the catalyst of an episode of epic proportion? Few believe it. Moreover, apparently there is little evidence of the involvement of any political elements during the whole course of the agitation. It remains an enigma more because the fray was joined by many non-students who couldn't possibly have anything common with what the students were fighting for.", "A comprehension of the bizarre explosion of the students' wrath, the extent of which clearly jolted the authorities and was watched with trepidation by the whole nation, is a must to be able to tide over the crisis that remains only suppressed at the moment. It is also essential to be able to sift out the inherent message of the uprising. These exercises may reveal some bitter truths, which ought to be taken in good spirit.", "The nightmarish experience during the past political government of the BNP-Jamaat preceded the installation of the present interim government. The majority of the people struggled for years to bring such a dispensation into being. In a twist of events, the interim government preferred to draw its strength from the military, although there is perhaps nothing wrong in that. But it can happen only at the cost of its standing with the people, who have welcomed this interim government and appreciated its brave and noble ventures.", "Belying public expectations, this dispensation has not been much of an improvement over earlier political governments, either in addressing the hard-issues of the nation or in resolving the complex problems of the masses. The socio-economic sector never looked as bleak as it does now. The prices of the daily necessaries have perhaps reached an all-time high. ", "Contrary to an adviser's claim, the purchasing power of the people has decreased due to double digit inflation. The moribund state of the infrastructure, as well as the continuing closure of the public sector enterprises and disincentive in investment, has pushed many to unemployment and virtual pauperisation. Things seem to be withering away, with the economy in the doldrums. Business and commercial activities have stalled, and there prevails a consternation and a sense of deja vu with regard to past public experiences.", "All these do not, however, reflect on the government's insincerity, but lay bare the limitations of a non-representative plutocracy staying long in power and expanding its agenda. The interim government, in its desire to do more, has over-stretched. As a result the routine has suffered. Moreover, a small band of plutocrats and technocrats, detached and alienated from the public, can seldom feel their pulse and be aware of their grievances, because there exists no mechanism for this purpose.", "Worst hit, however, has been the country's political arena, which suffers from total vacuum. In the process of reforms now underway, the old political edifice has been pulled down without being replaced by an appropriate structure. Consequently, the leadership, organisations, political programs, and even routine activities of stakeholders in national politics are in shreds with the suspension of fundamental rights and the state of emergency.", "All throughout the country's political history, the nation aspired and fought for democracy and a civilian-political supremacy, which are hallmarks of modern statecraft. It is not surprising that our student community, which has the tradition of pioneering enlightened ideas and bailing out the nation from crises, feels disillusioned at the country's ground realities with regard to its political prospects -- particularly restoration of the democratic status. The students as well as the inquisitive public want to see beyond the realities that meet their eye.  However, students cannot indulge in destruction of state and private property in the nameof agitation.", "The people have made many noble and great sacrifices, and have noble achievements, for which millions laid down their lives. Now when they take stock of them, they instinctively want to preserve those achievements. They have respect for the military, who are in one way or other their kith and kin.

The core message that comes out from numerous research works, seminars and workshops is that if the forests are gone, biodiversity will be gone too.

Before the world community comes forward to help us with damage control measures, we have to make our own people conscious about what would happen if all the forests were gone one day.

But as the gas situation was precarious, it was re-sealed on April 7, 2006.

{"reporter": "Binoy Barman", "headline": ["The price conundrum"], "lastModified": null, "newsBody": ["If you ask anybody what the number one problem of Bangladesh is at the moment, the answer will surely be \"price rise.\" In a real sense, it has become a more serious problem than corruption, which the government is busy chasing relentlessly when it is itself being chased by the wild beast of rising prices. ", "Price rise is more serious because it affects the lives of the whole population directly, while corruption affects people indirectly. Although both are harmful to society, price rise has by far the more devastating effect. The problem, over the years, has reached such a point that it has made life difficult not only for the poor but also for the average middle class. The pinch of high prices digs so deep that it gets to the bone. ", "Recent surveys reveal that the inflation rate is about ten per cent. The people feel helpless when they have to buy a kilogram of coarse rice for Taka 20. They become furious when they have to pay Taka 80 for a kilogram of lentil and Taka 20 for a kilogram of potatoes. They feel dizzy when they find that a kilogram of chilli sells at Taka 200. ", "The price rise was one of the toughest problems the four-party alliance government had failed to solve. I daresay, this unresolved problem made the erstwhile government most unpopular, and made people pledge-bound not to cast their votes for them. Sensing danger, they tried to form a caretaker government that would be allegiant to them and would bring them to power again. But the design was torn apart and the result was the present caretaker government (CG). ", "Therefore, it is evident that price rise has its role in the current political crisis the country is undergoing at present. The CG started its tenure with the commitment of containing prices, along with other tasks. Although this CG has inherited the problem from the previous government, it cannot avoid its responsibility to address it. ", "The CG is trying heart and soul to solve the price conundrum, which, however, is a hard nut to crack. The BDR bazaar cannot contain the prices, which gallop and gallop, shifting further beyond the reach of the common people. In fact, the BDR bazaar cannot be a permanent solution to the price problem. First of all, its impact is not widespread. Only a negligent number of people are benefited by the measure. Secondly, it cannot make a big price difference. The differences in price between commodities in the BRD bazaar and regular markets are marginal, so the degree of benefit is hardly worthy of mention. Thirdly, the BDR bazaar covers only a handful items -- rice, pulse, potato, and the like. But there are numerous other essential things needed for persons and families. Fourthly, and most importantly, the BDR bazaar has to work against the normal market mechanism. ", "It has little impact on demand and supply, the two principal determinants of price in market economy. It cannot control other factors like production, hoarding, transport, extortion, profiteering, syndication, export-import, and natural calamity, which also contribute to the price of a commodity. The government might attempt to mitigate the problem with open market sale (OMS), but this system is also fraught with the same range of problems as faced by the BDR bazaar. ", "Now, the CG has decided to deploy army in a desperate move to suppress price surge during Ramadan. There is, however, room to doubt whether this extreme measure will be effective. Price rise, being a complex problem, related to sociology on the one hand, and psychology on the other, cannot be solved so easily. This multifaceted problem needs multidimensional efforts for solution. ", "We can think of the nature of the efforts needed to tackle the problem of price hike. Firstly, the government may fix a code of conduct for businessmen, who, regrettably, fall short of showing a sense of decency in case of profit-making. There should be laws on how much profit they can make on the goods or services they deal in. The businessmen will have to submit buying and selling statements to the concerned cell (which has to be created by the government). If they violate the profit margin rule, they must be arrested and given exemplary punishment. This will discourage others from being dishonest in business.", "Secondly, the government has to strengthen the market monitoring system. A trained and honest team should be made for the purpose. Dedicated law enforcers may be employed in this job. Thirdly, there should be provisions for trying the price manipulators in speedy trial tribunals. Syndicated traders, wholesalers, retailers -- whoever is accused of perpetration -- must be brought to book. New laws may be enacted in this connection if existing ones do not suffice. Fourthly, the government might consider giving subsidy to certain \"very essential\" commodities if their \"logical\" market prices are found burdensome for the common people. ", "I suggest that the government constitute a powerful body comprising prominent economists of the country, legal experts, and high-ranking lawmen, who are knowledgeable about the reality here. For God's sake, don't include any businessmen in the body. It will investigate the situation and prepare an action plan for the government. If the government can effectively solve the price problem, it can claim to be successful. Otherwise, it will lose popular support and face the fate of any failed institution. People may forgive for failure in the campaign against corruption, and probably law and order, but they will never forgive for failure in taming the raging prices that make their lives hell!

If our GDP goes up to 8 per cent, we will need 450 mt coal to generate 41,000 mw power.", "If we continue with the Barapukuria underground mine, we will only produce less than half a million tons of coal each year. That means, till 2025, this mine will only produce 9 million tons! If we spend money for yet another sham like Barapukuria -- how much could it add? ", "In the best-case scenario, and if there is a miracle, 2 million tons a year? That would, at best, generate 36 million tons. Then in the lowest GDP scenario -- what should we do? Import coal or petroleum to compensate for 100 mt coal? This is a patriotic vision indeed.", "Readers should remember, we now have five identified coal zones. The total proven reserve is 2,350 mt (including the deep and large Jamalpur deposit). Our coal policy should cover development of all of these mines -- not just Phulbari. This coal is worth more than $100 billion in the current global market! Its up to us to make the best use of it -- not waste it by over-exploitation, and not under-utilise it by not developing it properly.", "While underground mines in China kill 5,000 people, unofficially 20,000, every year, there are fewer instances of fatalities in open-pit mines. Typically, all mine related fatalities take place in underground mines, where workers work in a high risk and very hot and humid environment. Open-pit mines are easy to work in. ", "But that does not make open-pit mines safe enough. There are instances of severe environmental damage caused by open-pit mines. The least of such hazards is the most visible one: the destruction of the natural landscape. No matter what technologies one uses, an open-pit mine will drastically change the landscape as it will strip the top soil, create large voids extending several square kilometres, fill up those voids where mining is complete and, finally, leave a void equivalent to the volume of the coal that has been extracted. In the best practice, the last void will be converted into a lake. The landscape in underground mining changes slowly. This kind of mine also causes land subsidence, but this process is slow. ", "A less visible hazard is damage caused to the underground water tables, which is an issue that used to be totally overlooked in the past. Mining, underground or open-pit, requires extraction of large volumes of water -- which eventually dangerously dries up the arable land around the mining area. ", "Unplanned release of the mine's water, which can be toxic depending on the soil condition of the mine, can damage marine life and can make a river sterile. Heavy metals or sulfide oxidation from this water also affect the environment.", "Research has found that several open-pit mines in the US (Nevada and other western states) lower groundwater, typically by aggressive pumping, to mine ore below the water table. In contrast, underground mines need less water pumping, because of the lower volume of coal production -- and, thereby, underground mines pose a lesser threat in this regard.", "Open-pit mines are developed by stripping the top soil, unlike the underground mines. The topsoil is fertile, and it is the giver of all agriculture products and forestry. Therefore, when an open-pit mine is developed, an area must be fully dedicated to the mine for at least two decades -- before the people can re-use it for agriculture and forestry. ", "As open-pit mines are large, they also demand displacement of a higher number people -- which causes social anxiety, uncertainty about the future, and unrest. The other environmental aspects of open-pit mine are sound and dust. Coal-fired power is the chief source of harmful CO2 emission in the air.", "All types of coal mines pose one common health hazard for the workers -- black lung. ", "Different nations, which are involved in mining for decades have had their hard lessons, therefore, each nation follows its own best practices which it has developed to minimise environmental hazards and human sufferings. ", "Some hazardous mines have been closed, but mining has not stopped -- because humans need energy. Some nations don't have the best practices, and some nations follow the best possible practice there is. Germany, France and Australia are some of the countries known for best environmental practices (which is also an evolving process).", "The landscape will change, for sure. But its up to the planners to keep that landscape looking good. In Germany, the post-mine landscape is hilly in some parts and flat in other parts. The residual lakes have been created with water safe enough for children to swim in and fish to grow. It will take years before the water from these lakes will be safe for drinking.  ", "Germany has been addressing the water issues for three decades. It scientifically pumps out water where new mines will be developed and pumps the water back into the places where mining has been completed. ", "In addition, the pumped out water is distributed among the towns, villages and cities, sensitive water bodies, and, finally, the river. Of course, they make sure that the water is not toxic when it is pumped out. The end result is a visibly healthy agriculture and forest landscape. The German mining region produces sugar bit and has sugar mills adjacent to the mines.", "An external group monitors the mining companies activities to make sure that the mining is not affecting the water and environment in a way that cannot be addressed. ", "The German miners do not strip their open-pit mines mindlessly. The fertile top soil is stripped and kept in one location, and the soil layer below, which is basically sand, is kept in another location. When they refill the land, they put the sand layer first and the top soil in its right place. Then they implement a 7 to 10 year soil re-fertilisation plan to make sure that the top soil is as fertile as before. ", "The human resettlement issue is entirely a political matter, because compensation takes care of the monetary issue, but cannot ensure future lifestyle and livelihood. This is where government and local communities come in. This is why the German government, municipalities, and affected people work with coal mining companies, under certain legal framework, on resettlement.", "Best practices demonstrate that mining can be done with minimum environmental damages and minimum public grievances, while keeping the energy supply growth high.  To achieve that kind of standard, Bangladesh needs to adopt the appropriate environmental standards, and a set of environment and resettlement rules for mining. ", "The Barapukuria coal mine has a proven 389 mt coal. But alas! Because of corruption of the past BNP regime, we are now getting only 6 per cent of that reserve in the next 30 years! ", "Some geologists say Barapukuria is a bad example. Of course, it is a bad example. This is why one should properly review this example. This is the only example of coal mining in Bangladesh, and only fools will underplay this.", "Interestingly, it was Germany's RWE that made the first proposal with an Indian company for open-pit mining in Barapukuria in 1990-91. The government had ignored RWE (called RE then), and then secretly gone for the Chinese deal. The internal rate of return (IRR) was inflated from 13 per cent to 39 per cent (The Daily Star ran its reports) to justify this horrendous deal. ", "The Chinese miners did not carry out any hydrological or feasibility study, and the government, till date, has not even held an environmental study of the site. The Ben itself has not reviewed the mine, which we already have in our hands.", "More interestingly, the Barapukuria mine and power establishments have acquired 1.5 square kilometres of agriculture land. As the land is subsiding, the mining company is now planning to acquire eight adjacent villages. But let us stick to the 1.5 sq km area and try to understand the proportion of land that the people have lost because of this mine -- against an open-pit mine. ", "This 1.5 sq km area has been acquired to extract only 21m tons of coal from a reserve of 389 mt. The Chinese developers originally had planned to extract 60 mt (which is less than 20 per cent of the reserve). Let's pretend that we will get 60 mt by acquiring 1.5 sq km land. ", "If, hypothetically, we wanted to increase production at par with an open-pit mine by installing more shafts, we would have to acquire more land. If we wanted to extract 90 per cent of the reserve (or 350 mt) by this method by installing many shafts (which is impossible), we would have to acquire at least 7 to 8 sq km land. This land would have to be dedicated to the mine, as nothing else could have been done on it.", "I have put up this technically impossible picture just to illustrate that open-pit and underground is a matter of scale and technology. If open-pit is technically impossible in Bangladesh, we should not have anything to say. If it is possible, let us give it a new look.", "If Germany's example is too foreign for us, let us look at India. One would be surprised that coal mining in the Indian subcontinent started from Raniganj (opposite to north Bengal), Bengal, in 1774 under Warren Hastings' initiative. Coal India, responsible for 85 per cent of India's coal production, is based in Kolkata -- and is the largest coal company in the world in terms of coal production. It employs a little less than half a million people, and its turnover in 2005-06 was Rs. 339.98 billion.", "Let us bust the myth that India is highly dependent on underground mines. India has 218 open-pit mines and 354 underground mines.  ", "The 218 open-pit mines produce 85 per cent of the total hard coal production in India. In 2005-06, this amounted to 346 million tons. The largest open-pit coal mine is the South Eastern coal field of Coal India in Bilaspur, launched in 1981, with a maximum planned depth of 180 meters, currently being worked at a depth of 100 meters. India follows various international environmental standards in its mining.", "The Rajmahal open-pit coal-field is located in Godda district and eastern Jharkand in West Bengal -- opposite to Bangladesh's north Bengal. Coal is deposited in small Gondwana rocks -- similar to those in Bangladesh. The underground water table scenario is similar to that of Bangladesh -- with a deep water table reachable from the depth of only 8 to 9 meters.", "This field covers five coal basins with a proven deposit of 493 mt, and the quality of this coal is low. Open-pit will allow mining of 468 mt coal in 48 years. The 2.7 km by 2.6 km open-pit mine is producing 10.5 million tons of coal per year, with a future annual target of 15 mt. The coal from this field, that started production from 1985, is being used by the Farakka 1,000 megawatt power plant. Presently, mining the coal from a depth of 120 meters, the mine will require a total land of 1,829 hectares of land.", "Just for the reference of the readers, the coal seam in Barapukuria is located at a depth ranging from 118 meters gradually down to 503 meters. The Phulbari coal seam is located at a depth ranging between 140 meters to 250 meters. Germany's highest open-pit mine depth is 400 meters.", "As BEN activists are too focused on opposing Asia Energy's scheme, they may have inadvertently opposed some basic aspects of mining. Of course, open-pit mines can harm our environment -- but from the German experience we can see that there are ways to compensate for that damage. We need this coal to turn Bangladesh into a rich nation. We cannot settle for underground mines that will keep us dependent on energy imports.", "Nobody is saying we should cut-and-paste the German experience. Countries learn from each other. Our micro-credit system is being adopted in many countries. We have also adopted many agriculture technologies from other countries. ", "Some are badly implemented and some are good. It's the proper \"localisation\" of a foreign experience that should be our focus. In the global politics that revolves around energy, some nations and quarters will be very happy to see Bangladesh stays import dependent and poor. ", "The plea of environmental damages is so sensitive that some of us cannot keep our minds open to the fact that all except Bangladesh are utilising coal to become rich. We are not a mining nation. This should be our advantage -- because, till date, the only damage was done by a comparatively small mine. ", "We can easily learn from the best and worst practices around the world. Other countries have paid the price for environmental follies. We can simply avoid those follies and establish a regime of best practices.", "This piece does not undermine the concerns of the BEN activists; because I believe in watchful environmental groups for the benefit of the nation.

Therefore, instead of sitting idle and suffer as a fait accompli, perhaps we may try to adopt measures which may mitigate the sufferings of the flood stricken people, particularly belonging to the far flung areas.", "In this respect I have thought of following steps which may be of interest to the authorities and other  quarters: ", "1. Construction of six storied flood shelters in the remote inaccessible areas throughout the country to provide temporary shelters to the displaced persons and livestock of the locality. The shelters should have at least five thousand square feet in each floor with helipad facility on the roof. ", "2. Each shelter should be provided with two large boats for use during flood. ", "3.

The management committee of each shelter may comprise of representatives from local public, UP members, law enforcing agencies, NGOs like BRAC, Grameen Bank etc. The shelters should be under the overall legal and administrative supervision of the Ministry of LGRD.

Question is being raised-whether there is a signal for economic slow down? All of them thought to have welcomed the new interim government focusing on bringing in few long overdue corrections or corrective measures in the economic management process, often hindered by political regime. But six/seven months down the line, the same lot of people, seem to be frustrated with business confidence being down, corrective measures not yielding expected results or even question being raised with the nature and process of economic management or even about the role of some development partners. The resultant impact is- trust gap or disconnect about the destination model.", "Bangladesh had problems in congenial environment with regard to market lead growth, lack of appropriate policy directives, lack of infra-structure, lack of skilled manpower, capital shortage, inefficient money markets, regular natural calamities eating away the economic build ups, political unrest and etc. Despite that we had 5 plus percent economic growth in last 15 years or so. To be precise, we have seen 6.7 percent growth in fiscal year '05-06. Despite political turmoil, labour unrest in the garments belt, slow down in the government procurements, port, power and infrastructure constraints and political transition, the country has showed a reported growth of 6.5 percent in fiscal '06-07.The analysts took the higher growth momentum as a sign of the economy nearing a take off stage.", "What's happening in the new fiscal year of the new government? Are we doing okay? What we expected to happen? When the people will get to see the results of long awaited economic and political corrections? The following tables show the import, export and new L/C opening data for the last two fiscals. Trade data is very important for a land hungry import-prone country, which is trying to build on its core strengths as an RMG/textiles export nation.", "Domestic credit growth in July-May 2006-07 period was Tk 21, 631 crore or 12.17 percent growth against July-May 2005-06 of Tk 23, 954 crore or 16.23percent growth over corresponding period. This implies 4percent reduction of domestic credit year on year. Public sector credit grew by 9.35 percent over corresponding period of last year's growth of 38.87 percent. Private sector credit grew by 11.72 percent over corresponding period of last year's growth of 14.20 percent. Domestic investment is also reported to be down due to the corrective measures forced into the country due to recent change of regime. Total domestic borrowing during July-May 2006-07 was Tk 7545 crore or 40.76 percent growth over corresponding period last year, which was Taka 5360 crore in July-May 2005-06. Bank borrowing during July-May 2006-07 was Tk 3577 crore or 42.11 percent growth over corresponding period last year (July-May 2005-06 was Tk  2517 crore). Non Bank borrowing during July-May 2006-07 was Tk 3968 crore or 39.58 percent growth over corresponding period last year (July-May 2005-06 was Tk 2843 crore). Composition of deficit financing in last fiscal was: from Foreign source 37.66 percent, from Domestic source 62.34 percent, previous fiscal: from Foreign source 48.04 percent, from Domestic source 51.96 percent (source: Bangladesh Bank). If we analyse the above data, we would see that export, import payment and new L/C opening have increased year on year, but the 2nd half of the fiscal year was significantly slower than the first half of the fiscal year. Also, if we consider the figure from January to June '07 with preceding six months we would find that the numbers have actually been decreasing. The July-August period is not expected to show any dramatic upside.. ", "With all that seen above and tension in the business community, we can possibly agree with our economists that the economy is slowing down. May be other factors like low agricultural production, price hike of essentials, nabbing the top business people and putting them behind the bar or under corruption radar or as such political correction from early this year, might have contributed significantly here, but the issue remains to be- economy showing symptoms of slowing down. If we accept that reality, now the million dollar question would be- if the economy is slowing down, is that going to be `V' curve or `U' curve recovery. As we have seen in the US economic slow down (which afterwards impacted the entire world) early this decade, though it was expected to be a `V' curve or quick bottom up recovery, it ultimately became a long lasting `U' curve recovery, which is again under threat with this latest sub prime mortgage related debacle. While this nation, which almost forced itself into a `correction' mode, probably can withstand a 'V' curve, but an `U' curve could be an extremely painstaking journey.", "Though with the growth momentum of last two fiscal, our policy planners have projected a growth rate of 7 percent, some of the economists with what's happening around, are visualising a shocking reverse in the growth rate for the first time in several years. Few of them even apprehend that the growth rate could be very marginal, which we of course don't pray or hope for. Government has reportedly announced to revive the economy through increasing public spending. This is apparent from the flood recovery plan in the offing, from feeding people to repairing infrastructures. As per the books taught in our economics classes, this would put money into people's pockets, provide them some purchasing power with temporary increase in employment creation. However, this is also true that this kind of pubic spending (including flood aid or rehabilitation) does not always support sustainable growth. In absence of growth generating investments in the domestic sector as well as lack of foreign investments, the net investment is likely to remain bearish during this fiscal, if not beyond.", "The challenge for the government is therefore to win the confidence of the business community. Businessmen should be allowed to manage their `money' with ease and make their own investment decisions. Though some of them have been nabbed on corruption charges, the `fear' has engulfed most of them. Their entire `business model' (the way they run their business, maintain books of accounts and settle sovereign claims/dues) seems to be rocked up. It seems they have decided to go low or even stop investments for the time being, on the basis of faced realities or perceived ones. It is not that they want anti corruption drive to stop, but they expect this to be done with due care, and of course without creating a `panic' situation for all of them and thereby impacting the entire business activities of the country. With bit of handholding from the ruling regime and understanding from the business community, it is possible for anti corruption drive and business activities to co-exist or even flourish. When we cross Bhatiary and reach Faujderhat on train towards Chittagong, we get to see a writing on the top of a hill- `Katha Noy, Kaj'(Deeds, not words). We need more activities from our growth drivers including regulatory agencies, towards that direction, not unnecessary words overheating the entire system, and creating doubts about integrity of the purpose.

", "One would naturally ask: Is the incident simply a temper tantrum, or is it a pretext machinated by some estranged pressure groups to trigger a larger movement against the government.  ", "What was most unfortunate, though, was the attitude of the university faculty who openly supported the students' unruly protests instead of calming and guiding them for realisation of their legitimate demands for the pulling out of the army and the police from campus grounds. ", "It's inexplicable why the university community would risk whatever reforms and good governance have been achieved since 1/11.  ", "The students' and teachers' demand quickly expanded from removal of the army and police from the campus to lifting of the state of emergency (SOE).", "And why does the immediate lifting of the SOE constitute one of their demands? So far, SOE has infringed very little, if at all, on the freedom of the media, and not at all on academic freedom and intellectual discourses in college and university campuses, except outlawing hartals, lock-outs and aboroads. ", "The countrywide students' unrest, joined by a select group of the faculty and roadside onlookers, instead of shortening the tenure of the SOE would now justify prolonging it until the 2008 election and the installation of an elected government. ", "The eruption may have also hurt the prospects for lifting of the moratorium on indoor politics -- a setback for both intra-party reforms and the proposed discourses between the EC and the political parties surrounding the roadmap to the general election.  ", "There is no denying that stationing of the army in the campus gymnasium caused inconvenience to students' athletic activities. A constant presence of the army on campus grounds is, in itself, an irksome spectacle, brewing pent-up tensions waiting to flare-up on any pretext and ploy. ", "The university administration shouldn't have dithered in persuading the authorities to withdraw the army camp from the campus grounds when it was first installed. ", "The demand for withdrawal of the army and the police from campus grounds is fully justified, whilst the brawl for lifting the SOE, and rioting on the streets, obviously seemed like playing into the hands of the politicians working to disrupt electoral reforms. ", "Now that the army has vacated the campus, the students should reassess their role in light of their academic objectives, dedication to campus discipline, and their concern for the safety of the entire academic community. ", "They should think about learning and preparing for the real world, and specialising in the areas of their interest, rather than exhausting their stressed energy in protests and political unrest.   ", "Historically, students have played a significant role in many national movements, including the 1952 language movement, the overthrow of Ayub Khan in 1969, the 1971 war of independence, and the 1990 \"restore democracy and oust autocrat Ershad from power\" movement. However, given what brought the SOE, the post 1/11 CTG, and the cascading reform initiatives in the judiciary, EC, ACC, PSC and so on, a another \"restore democracy movement\" must wait until the scheduled 2008 election.  ", "Adviser Mainul Hosein's recent concerns that failure of this government would be grievous is a reflection of the government's realization of the brewing dissatisfaction of the people in many areas, including the persistent price spiral. ", "The government must also realise that its claim \"no one is above the law\" is being dismissed by the people as a mere catchphrase because of the obvious dilly-dallying in pressing charges against the country's allegedly most corrupt former prime minister, her son and her brother. People know \"charges delayed are crimes bypassed.\"   ", "As this government cannot fail, the army and all branches of law enforcement must act even- handedly and not lose people's ultimate trust in them. However, the unfortunate brutality with which the police dealt with the protestors' is evocative of the repressive eras of the past, and grossly at variance with IGP Noor Mohammad's vision of a people-friendly police. Nonetheless, the students' irresponsible acts cannot be condoned either. ", "Pre-1/11 campus politics required mastering violence, agitation, hooliganism, kidnapping, and so on. Campus violence has plagued higher education. Much like trade unions, student organisations promoted the political agendas of their affiliated national parties, and often did so under the tutelage of faculty groups. Should the students allow themselves to become pawns of the corrupt and ill-educated politicians again?  ", "Pre-1/11, student politics were guided by non-students cloaked as students. Over the last 15 years, many student activists simply mimicked their national leaders' penchant for land-grabbing, extortion, assaulting the media, and brutally attacking the opposition. Would the students like to engage in those illicit pursuits instead of focusing on their academic goals?", "The pre-1/11 illicit activities tarnished the image of student politics. At the same time, the quality of post liberation graduates, politicians, and civil servants has depreciated significantly relative to the pre-liberation period. Shouldn't the students and faculties work jointly for improving academic discipline, rather than promoting disruption in the learning environment on campus? ", "The post 1/11 administration in the country in terms of rule of law and overall governance, in my objective judgment, is better than any in the past. The judiciary and the Election Commission are achieving constitutional independence. Many more institutional reforms are in the pipeline. Why would the students rather turn back the clock to be ruled by a politicised and corrupt administration?   ", "Students should always assess the quality of their teachers. Are they engaged in scholarly pursuits and dedicated classroom teaching? How many of these teachers are chasing money by moonlighting (consulting and part time teaching elsewhere) instead of devoting their time and attention towards helping their students reach their academic potential? ", "Shouldn't the students ask their strike-supporting teachers if they're taking a salary cut when the students are taking a class cut from university closure?    ", "All academic minded students everywhere must realise that a minor incident at Dhaka University, absolutely personal in nature, could not spread countrywide unless politically disruptive and violence mongering elements masquerading as students were working to derail the government's initiatives to lock up the corrupt and the criminals and conduct a free and fair election. Do the students want to be accomplices to their evil designs and causes?

It was vandalism of the worst kind. They wanted to make it look like a student protest, but people saw only a few astray students and hundreds of hoodlums going berserk on the streets. As a result, people withdrew their support and sympathy and openly condemned the actions.", "The recent student protest on various campuses brought forth the role of some of the student leaders who allegedly have worked from behind to fan the fire on behalf of the political parties for their individual and narrow political gain. The very mention of the term \"student leaders\" continues to intrigue us. ", "Who are these people? What actually do they do on the campuses across the country?

Do they bargain with the authorities to take examinations in time, take classes regularly, and assess performance of students impartially? Do they take steps to improve the infrastructure, laboratory facilities, hostel facilities, research facilities, and teaching/learning standard of the institution? ", "They do nothing of the above. We have information that they are the licensed gangs of toll collectors who send their cadres to collect weekly tolls from shop owners and contractors. They come with two trousers and two shirts from their villages and eat free breakfast, lunch, and dinner in student halls. Within three years on the campus, they drive tinted Pajeros and live in their own flats in Gulshan or Banani. Aladdin's lamp? No, blessing of madam or apa. ", "The present lot of student leaders is quick to cash in on the reputation of the past leaders, who had shown great valour in our fight against the Pakistani rulers. But this has to be added here that many of those past \"heroes,\" at a later time, forgot all about their ideology. It's sad, people do not consider them heroes anymore.", "    ", "We had started with the warning of dark forces working together to push the country back to square one.

Despite the battering he has been getting in recent months, especially over his decision in March to sack Pakistan's chief justice, he remains unwilling to acknowledge his role in the making of his troubles. The fact that Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry was re-instated by the Supreme Court was a sign of the new difficulties the president would soon face. And they came soon enough. The judiciary swiftly released an arch Musharraf foe, Javed Hashmi, from what could have been a long spell in jail had the military ruler had his way.

The general has a simple, almost outrageous answer to such a question. He says in that case they will either be placed under arrest or sent back into exile in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Arabia factor appears to be working with Musharraf since it is his contention that the former prime minister had made a deal with him to stay out of Pakistan and in Saudi Arabia for ten years. According to Musharraf, therefore, by coming back home Sharif will be reneging on the deal. It is this attitude of the president that is worrying. He is keen on emphasising a deal that Sharif obviously made under duress, at a time when the latter had already been ousted in a coup. But he is oblivious to the thought that through taking such a position he is holding the Supreme Court in contempt. If he does try to prevent the Sharif brothers from returning home, it is quite likely that the judiciary will move again, this time to discipline him.

{"reporter": "Rekha Chakravarthi", "headline": [], "lastModified": null, "newsBody": ["On 30 June 2007, the Bush administration announced an arms package of US$63 billion to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf States along with Israel, aimed at containing Iran's growing influence. The deal was justified by the US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, at a conference in the Gulf when she said: \"There isn't a doubt that Iran constitutes the single most important single-country strategic challenge to the United States and to the kind of Middle East we want to see.\" The arms package involves US$20 billion for Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, US$13 billion for Egypt, US$30 billion for Israel, including warships for the Saudis' eastern fleet that faces the Iranian navy in the Persian Gulf.", "As can be inferred from the above statement, the US is increasingly concerned with Iran's growing political influence, not least interference, in Iraq and elsewhere in the region. American (as well as Israel's) suspicion of Iranian motives stems from a number of factors. To begin with, the US views Iran's nuclear gambit with extreme caution, firm in its belief that the latter is pursuing a nuclear weapons programme. The second most pressing concern for the US is Iran's alleged provocative role in fueling the insurgency in Iraq by buttressing Shia militants (whether militarily or financially), thereby undermining American efforts to stabilize the nation. Finally, Iran's support for anti-Israeli militant organizations such as Hamas and Hezbollah, widely considered to be Iranian proxies.", "Many Arab states, especially Saudi Arabia, fear sectarian violence (if unchecked) may spill over into neighbouring states, thereby threatening their Arab identity (vis-a-vis Sunni dominance). Subsequently, Saudi Arabia, has bolstered Sunni insurgents against Shia militias. The US, for the first time, recently voiced its contempt against the weapons, finances and personnel flowing into Iraq from many Arab states in support of Sunni insurgents, arguing it undermines stabilization efforts. In essence, the deal may be considered a quid pro quo for Saudi restraint. Top US officials have in fact stressed the deal is an attempt to reassure their Arab allies by insuring them against a possible fallout of the ongoing sectarian war. It may also be viewed as a contingency against retaliatory attacks from Iran, should there be a US or US-Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities or the Revolutionary Guard Units aiding Shia insurgents in Iraq. Finally, the deal also provides a security-blanket to Israel should the new arms supplied to the Arab States be turned against the former. Most importantly, the deal is an indication that the United States intends to keep a presence in the region in case of an eventual withdrawal from Iraq.", "Many analysts, however, have criticized this deal and see it as a last resort in anticipation of failure of Washington's policies with regard to Iraq and Iran. An emerging American-led alliance comprising of so-called 'moderate' Arab regimes can be likened to a Middle Eastern version of NATO. This strategy to counter Iran appears to have drawn inspiration from the Cold War text. Washington is simultaneously aiming to contain Iran and compel it to squander money on an arms race, thereby further jeopardizing Tehran's economy. The Washington-Tehran antagonism may run parallel to the Moscow-Washington fiasco, however, the US is overlooking certain imperatives. Iran's increasing clout in the region is not because of its military muscle but the manner in which it has wielded power by way of supporting militias throughout the region, thereby challenging the Israeli and American command. Moreover, Iran is the only state in the region apart from the US, bolstering a Shia government in Iraq. A Time magazine story in August 2005 reported that the Iranian assistance to Shiite insurgents was \"dwarfed by the amount of money and material flowing in from Iraq's Arab neighbours to Sunni insurgents\". Therefore, arming Iran's Sunni-Arab neighbours does nothing to resolve the conundrum, especially when there have been reports that most of the suicide bombers in Iraq are Saudi citizens.", "If the US finalizes the deal, the weapons sales will undoubtedly encourage Iran to hurry in developing its arms technology. Iran may also seek weapons from Russia and China more aggressively. Consequently the American dream of promoting democracy in the region will witness a premature death. A US-Iran confrontation is likely to unleash greater upheaval in the region and accelerate the course of sectarian aggression in Iraq. The US would do well by realizing that this deal will provide more breeding space for radical Sunni groups vehemently opposed to American, Iranian and Shiite influence. Moreover, given the manner in which arms have been previously proliferated across borders in the region, the probability of their being stashed by militant groups remain high. It is time Washington appreciates that massive military equipment induction is not the road to peace in the region. Instead, it should work in cooperation with all of Iraq's neighbours, including Iran and Syria, to counter the consequences of withdrawing from Iraq."], "tag": ["Strategic Issues"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=1432", "location": null, "date": "2007-08-26"}
{"reporter": "Dr. Abdul Ruff Colachal", "headline": ["Arabs in Israel"], "lastModified": null, "newsBody": ["For many decades the conflict between Arab states and Israel has remained an explosive issue revolving around the creation of a homeland for the Palestinians. Emboldened by the economic as well as military support it receives from the USA-led west and other nations like India by way of selling weapons to them, Israel has successfully retained most of Palestine and conducted campaigns on Palestine. Intermittent wars by Israel on the Palestinians on one hand and on Lebanon on the other not only made the issue more and more complicated but the very existence of the Palestinians also became a question mark. In recent years, however, many Arab League member states have adopted a more conciliatory tone toward Israel, as they became more concerned about the rising influence of Iran's hard-line regime and al-Qaida's brand of extremist Islam. Moderate Arab countries and the West have been pushing for renewed Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking since Gaza fell to Hamas, a group that refuses to recognize Israel. ", "After the first ever visit by Israeli leaders to Saudi Arabia, the Arab leaders have also made a similar trip to Israel. Led by the foreign ministers of Egypt and Jordan, the Arab delegation representing 22 countries was taken deep into Israel's political heartland. The delegates met the prime minister and the president and visited parliament, bringing a proposal for full recognition of Israel by the Arab and Islamic world in return for Israel's withdrawal from all lands captured in the 1967 Middle East war. \"This serious offer constitutes a major opportunity of historical levels,\" Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul-Ilah Khatib said at a news conference alongside his Israeli and Egyptian counterparts. \"It will provide Israel with the security, recognition and acceptance in this region which Israel has long aspired to.\" He said the plan was endorsed not only by the Arab League, but also by non-Arab Muslim states. At the outset, Israel has welcomed the proposal as a basis for negotiations but says parts of it are unacceptable.", "Both Jordan and Egypt already have peace treaties with Israel and have sent their leaders to the country before, but never on the Arab League's behalf. The delegates themselves said they were sent by the Arab League and would report back to it on Monday. \"We are not being asked to negotiate on behalf of the Palestinians,\" Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit said. \"We will be helping both the Palestinians and the Israelis to negotiate among themselves.\" He cautioned against any expectation of a quick resolution to the dispute. \"I don't expect that we shall see a Palestinian state established tomorrow,\" he said. The Arab states, according to Amr Moussa, the secretary general of the Arab League, expressed his reservations and skepticism stating: \u201cWe are not convinced at all that Israel is ready to embark on a serious peace process, citing continued settlement building and construction of barriers in the West Bank.\u201d However, it has agreed to open a dialogue with Israel for the first time in its history. The decision to send a delegation to Israel to discuss the peace plan is seen as being reflective of the weakness of Arab countries, having no bargaining position.", "It may be recalled that an Arab Summit held in Saudi Arabia in March 2007 revived the Abdullah Peace Plan, approved in the Beirut Summit of 2002. The Saudi peace plan was based on the principle of land for peace and mutual recognition. It is, however, a measure of the Arabs' weakness that they have reversed themselves, offering peace, recognition and negotiations in return for Israeli withdrawal to 1967 borders. What Israel rejected in 2002 could hardly form the basis of negotiations in 2007. The emergence of Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, deemed by Israel as its implacable enemies, has led Israel to intensify the conflict between Fatah and Hamas and lead them on to bloody confrontation. Such a strategy will enable Israel to declare that it has no negotiating partner. Bush's plan is based on isolation of Hamas politically and its marginalization financially. The plan has been offered in the twilight years of Bush's presidency.", "The plan once again has offered Israel an Arab peace initiative and the opportunity to resume the process of direct and serious negotiations on all tracks. The UNSC Resolutions 242 and 338, which held the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by use of force and had urged Israel to withdraw from the territories occupied in the June 1967 War. Israel, as expected, rejected the peace plan and reiterated its opposition to the right of the Palestinians to return to their homes within Israel proper. The Arab League, on its part, declined to redraft the plan. The Arab League initiative thus failed to make any headway. The Abdullah Plan is based on UNSC Resolutions 242 and 338. It declares that a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East is the strategic option of Arab nations. Under the plan, Israel must confirm that it too seeks peace and in return for recognition and security, it must withdraw from territories occupied during the 1967 War, accept the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital and achieve a just solution to the Palestinian refugee problem under the terms of UN Resolution 194.", "With Israel rejecting the Arab Peace proposal to create a Palestine by following the required conditions by Israel in exchange for better cooperation with Arab states, the prospects of peace in the Middle East remains a bleak proposition. Israel presented the one-day visit as an unprecedented conciliatory gesture by the Arab League which actively pursued the destruction of the Jewish state when it was established in 1948, refused to recognize it for decades afterward and suspended Egypt for a decade after it became the first Arab state to make peace with Israel in 1979. After pulling out of the Gaza Strip in 2005, Israel still rejects a full withdrawal from the West Bank and east Jerusalem, hoping to retain areas heavily settled by Israelis. And Israel strenuously objects to the plan's apparent call for the repatriation to Israel of Palestinians who became refugees in the 1948 Mid-east war and their descendants  some 4.4 million people, according to the United Nations. Israel says any influx of refugees would mean the end of Israel as a Jewish state. Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni said the way ahead was to look for points of agreement between Israel and the Arab world while seeking a bilateral solution to core issues such as the refugees and the status of Jerusalem.", "The Palestinians have been undergoing one trouble after another engineered by Israel. The plot envisaged aimed at the creation of two Palestines, one for Hamas and another for Fatah; accordingly, Abbas has overthrown the Hamas government and installed his own. Since Hamas took over Gaza in mid-June, Israel has only permitted shipments of food and basic supplies into Gaza through two smaller passages. Israel, which shuns Hamas as a terrorist organization, says it cannot reopen Karni passage. Israel will be ready to reopen the crossings when the Palestinians get their house together regarding security at the crossings,\" he added. Tel Aviv is using the passage as a weapon to punish the Palestinians.", "The U.N. Mideast envoy Michael Williams warned on July 25 of impending economic collapse in the Gaza Strip unless Israel reopens the Hamas-led territory's main commercial crossing to the outside world to ease international isolation. Williams said the closure of the Karni crossing in early June has prevented the export of agricultural and industrial goods to Israel, the West Bank and elsewhere, as well as the import of materials needed for manufacturing and construction. The restriction has brought the Gaza economy to a standstill. The World Bank estimates that 75 percent of Gaza's factories have closed and more than 68,000 Palestinian workers have been laid off as a result, he said. In his report, Williams praised the quick response of the international community to provide financial aid and political support to the Fatah-led government set up in the West Bank by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and his pro-Western prime minister, Salam Fayyad. He said Gaza and the West Bank cannot remain separated in the long term, but there are no immediate prospects for reconciliation between the two sides, either. \"Unless the crossings are open for imports and exports, the downward economic spiral will lead to extensive hardship for an already impoverished Gaza Strip,\" Williams told the U.N. Security Council in his regular monthly briefing on the Middle East. Israel says that it is fully cooperating with the relative U.N. agencies to ensure the constant flow of foodstuff and medicine into Gaza to ensure there are no humanitarian shortages, and the international community confirms that there is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza,\" Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev said in Jerusalem.", "A new vague Bush plan is being promoted in the Middle East. In a surprise move, President Bush in a nationally televised speech on July 16 proposed an international conference for reviving the Middle East peace process. President Bush's naivet\u00e9 in putting across the proposal in such stark terms is typical of him. He also announced $190 million assistance for the Palestinians and clearly wants the Palestinians to shed the Hamas by calling Hamas terrorists, and Fatah, a patriotic front with Mahmoud Abbas, a visionary of \"a peaceful state\", called Palestine as a homeland for the Palestinian people\u201d. Bush's 2003 road-map visualizing a two-state solution also talked of territorial adjustments, showing that the US did not support Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied territories. Bush's characterization of Hamas as more \u201cdevoted to extremism and murder than to serving the Palestinian people\u201d would further deepen the conflict. The proposal for convening an international conference, to be chaired by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in November 2007, involving Israel, the Palestinian Authority and some Arab states, would only complicate the issue further and also intensify the conflict between Hamas and Fatah. It is not only the Hamas alone but Israel's leadership too is against Bush's proposal. \u201cWe are not willing to discuss at this stage the three core issues of borders, refugees, and Jerusalem,\u201d declared Olmert's spokesman. Little wonder that Middle East observers are skeptical of the success of Bush's initiative. Daniel Levy, a former Israeli negotiator, has rightly observed, \u201cThe two-state solution will need to deliver and have legitimacy on both sides to be sustainable. This cannot be based on an irreconcilable Palestinian political division.\u201d", "In the meantime, the former British Premier also undertook a trip to Jerusalem. President Mahmoud Abbas and his pro-Western prime minister, Salam Fayyad, urged Blair to push a political agenda that would help restart direct talks with Israel on the core issues. Blair recognizes and understands that Gaza can't be separated. He understands that the Gaza economy is important and vital for the West Bank economy. Palestinian business leaders told Blair that Israeli checkpoints in the West Bank have stifled the economy. \"Reform and economy can't be tackled without Gaza being an integral component.\"  Israel says the barrier, about two-thirds complete along it's planned 425-mile route, is meant to stop suicide bombers; but the Palestinians call it a land grab. The UN's International Court of Justice in The Hague has declared the structure illegal.", "Hamas has understandably denounced both Blair and the new Middle East peace plan, \u201cwhich aims to serve the interests of the Zionist enemy\u201d and will separate the Gaza Strip more deeply from the West Bank while increasing divisions among the Palestinians. The supporters of Abbas' Fatah and the rival Hamas movement keep clashing and killing each other. People are injured and killed in regular Israeli air raids in Gaza. As Blair visited Ramallah, riots erupted at the An Najah University in Nablus, about 30 miles away. A Palestinian student was shot and seriously wounded. The rejection of Blair mediation by Hamas is quite understandable because they don't trust him. But the fact remains that he had to sacrifice his Premiership of UK only when he announced a plan to withdraw the troops from Israel in opposition to USA stand for continuity. Bush is a different matter altogether.", "Under emerging situation in the region, Whether or not a delegation sent to Israel by the Arab League is in fact an Arab League delegation, the visit is part of a flurry of diplomatic efforts meant to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks after a seven-year lull. The international community's Mid-east envoy, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, made his first trip in his new role to the region this week, and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is expected next week. While the Israeli and Arab officials greeted each other with smiles, jokes and what looked like genuine warmth, both sides acknowledged that the Arab League peace proposal couldn't bypass direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians.", "It seems no Israeli government will sign an agreement with a Palestinian leader who is not authoritative, peace-seeking, residing over a unified populace and in control of all guns. Both the West and Israel have groomed Abbas to initiate a two-nation agenda for the Palestinians, but that would be dangerous for the Palestinians themselves even if that solves the \"Israeli problem\". No Palestinian government can sign an accord with Israel that does not resolve the core issues of Jerusalem, borders and refugees. Neither the US-led West whole-heartedly supports the Palestinian cause nor is Israel, on the strength of US support, keen to resolve the Palestine crisis. One thus does not really know, if all these delegations, big-power visits and peace plans could only essentially mean going back to square one with no tangible results!"], "tag": ["Strategic Issues"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=1431", "location": null, "date": "2007-08-26"}

Khurshed Alam ", "headline": ["Decommissioning and re-commissioning of a Navy ship"], "lastModified": null, "newsBody": ["Among the navies all over the world, Commissioning is the act or ceremony of placing a warship on active duty with the country's naval force. The commissioning ceremony marks the acceptance of a warship as a unit of the operating forces in the Bangladesh Navy. Thereafter the ship is officially referred to as the Bangladesh Navy Ship (BNS). A commission is the fixed period of time in which a warship, with its full complement of officers and men, is allocated to specific duties as a part of a fleet/ squadron/ flotilla.                 ", "The ceremonies involved are rooted in centuries old naval traditions. BNS Khalid Bin Walid (Bangabandhu) was launched in Korea in 1999 and was endowed a ship hull with her identity. The engineering plant, weapon and electronic systems, galley, and multitude of other equipment, required to transform the new hull into an operating and habitable warship were installed and tested. The commanding officer, ship's officers, the non commissioned officers and seamen were selected and sent to Korea for training and intensive familiarization with their new ship. The new ship underwent sea trials during which deficiencies were rectified and it finally arrived in Bangladesh after a sea passage of almost 17000 km. Through custom and usage, however, a fairly standard practice was followed to commission her, the essentials of which were  officers and crew members of the new ship were assembled on the naval jetty area.", "Formal transfer of the ship to the prospective commanding officer was done   ceremonially by the then PM on behalf of the honourable President. The Chief Guest read the commissioning directive, the national anthem was played, the jack and ensign were hoisted, and distinctive commissioning pennant broken at the mast head, and the ship was placed in commission as the BNS Bangabandhu in June 2001thorugh a public ceremony", "Normally, after a ship is commissioned she is supposed to continue in that state until she is paid off, at which time her ships company is dispersed. Decommissioning of a warship is normally overseen by the commander of the fleet and is usually attended by other senior officers and government officials. After the Chief Guest's arrival honours are rendered, the national anthem is played to commence the ceremony, a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the ship's history is read out, and after receiving the last report from various departments the commanding officer asks his superior officer for permission to decommission the ship. After granting it, the attending officers and guests are piped ashore with appropriate honours. Once the crew is ashore, the commanding officer orders, \"Strike eight bells,\" and all present salute as the national ensign and jack are lowered. The commissioning pennant is hauled down last. The commanding officer is presented the last commissioning pennant to fly over the ship to keep as a memento, and the crew member with the most years of service keeps the last ensign flown by the ship.", "The sequence of events in the Navy after BNS Bangabandhu's commission was totally dictated by those close to the seats of power. PM's office, without going through MOD or Armed Forces Division, formed a committee to investigate the ships purchase. President of one of the original selection committee was appointed the president of this committee, totally disregarding navy rules and other rules of the country. The rule clearly states that anybody associated with the purchase before, cannot be appointed in such investigation committee. But this was intentionally done with ulterior motives. ", "All the committee members were then promoted to higher rank and the President of the Committee was rewarded with the highest appointment in the service. Events were dictated in such a fashion that the ship could remain in active service only till Feb 2002 and disregarding all norms, the BNS Bangabandhu was decommissioned, without following any rules of the navy and placed into Reserve class iii without any justification. ", "According to Bangladesh Navy Regulations, Reserve class iii means \u201cShips with major defect requiring refit before service and therefore at extended notice and normally not stored\u201d. It was not known for what reasons the brand new ship was decommissioned after only 8 months of active duty. She was not due for major refit at all as required by the Navy Regulation and did not have chronic major problems which needed such out of proportion action by the navy. Warranty repairs were supposed to be done even during its commission. ", "Point to note is that the navy lowered the commissioning pennant of the ship but did not hand over the same as part of a proper decommissioning. Contrary to any existing rule, the Navy allowed the ship to sail to the sea with her ensign without commissioning pennant, ship's commanding officer and full ship's crew remained onboard. Although it is not supposed to be stored, she must have been provided with all types of stores, food, clothing and even arms and ammunitions. ", "It has been reliably learnt that the ship has been fitted with Chinese missile system against the original selection, which is yet to be functional with the ship's system. It is alleged that the system cost the navy almost half of the total ships price.", "We congratulate the caretaker government and all others associated with the decision of putting the ship into commission, which is the only state of art ship Bangladesh Navy has acquired so far.  But an important question remains why the name of the ship has been changed. It would be quite difficult to find another instance of changing a ship's name in the same navy unless it was transferred to some other navy. Members of the public have every right to know the real reasons for changing the name of the ship. It would have been only proper for the government to keep the same name which would have set a good precedence for our future generations. But the good initiative of the present government to commission the ship must be followed up with some other actions as to who and what prompted the authority to take the brand new ship out of commission. Was it proper as per Navy Rules or were the rules manipulated to satisfy some individual at the cost of the service and the nation? ", "The nation has a right to know how and why more than five years of the ship's useful life have been wasted. She could not be used for protection of the sea resources for which the nation has paid and the officers and men were deprived from getting much needed training from the only state of art ship of BN. Persons responsible for such action must answer as to what made them place the ship in reserve class three, why she was allowed to proceed to sea violating the rules and regulations, allowed installation of missiles system against the original selection which is yet to be operational, how the ship officers and men were paid and the stores were issued to a decommissioned ship. It would be an injustice if such questions are not answered in right earnest and those responsible are not brought to book.

And the United States is trying to put the blame for its own failures on China. Lyn Cockburn, a columnist for The Ottawa Sun, recently wrote: \"Watch the evening news or pick up a newspaper and you're almost certain to see something about China's many sins -- economic and moral.\" Cockburn has succinctly pointed out the tendency in the West, especially in the US, to find \"a big bad guy\" to test its mettle. The Soviet Union served this purpose during the Cold War. Now, Russia is not as powerful as it used to be. After 9/11, al-Qaeda provided some kind of threat. But it is too amorphous, too weak militarily to become a threat on its own, despite the Bush administration's best efforts to make it one. So China, with its large population and growing industrial might, seems to fit the description.", "By the end of 2006, China achieved several important milestones: It replaced the US as Japan's biggest trading partner, it replaced Japan as America's second biggest trading partner after Canada (for a brief period, it even replaced Canada as America's biggest trading partner), and it replaced the US as the European Union's biggest trading partner. And it surpassed America as the world's second biggest trading nation after Germany.", "It is also interesting to note that US-China trading is a one-sided affair. While China exported a staggering $287 billion to the US, America exported a paltry $55 billion to China, leaving a $230 billion trade surplus in China's favour. By the end of July, China's trade surplus for the first half of this year rose to $112.5 billion, marking the first time that it has exceeded $100 billion in a six-month period. If the economy keeps growing at this blistering pace, China's total trade will reach more than $2 trillion this year, surpassing Germany as the world's biggest trading nation. ", "These would be staggering numbers anytime. As Goldman Sachs, one of America's biggest investors put it: \"This level of trade surplus is unprecedented for China or any other major economy in the world.\" It is also doubly surprising, given all the bad news about the safety of Chinese products. The U.S. and other governments are threatening to put restrictions on Chinese imports. But none of this seems to have put slightest crimp on the demand for cheap goods from China. Shoppers in the United States, Canada, and other Western nations continue to snap up televisions, computers, cameras, shoes, garments, and toys that flow in an ever-swelling caravan of container ships from China.", "The United States blames China for deliberately keeping its currency under-devalued to gain unfair advantage. But the American policymakers may be reminded that both Japan and Germany have been able to maintain a balanced trade relationships with China. It only shows how uncompetitive the US economy has become while America remains embroiled in a ruinous war in Iraq.", "It is undeniable that American demand for Chinese goods, more than undervalued Chinese currency, helps Chinese surplus to grow by leaps and bounds. Despite the US Congress's griping about the unfair advantage of an under-valued yuan, the Chinese currency has, in fact, risen against the US dollar by 8.9 percent since China stopped pegging to the greenback in July, 2005. This suggests that the yuan alone can't be the reason for China's rising trade surplus vis-\u00e0-vis the United States.", "The surplus is a product of demand and supply: the huge demand of America's consumers for relatively inexpensive Chinese goods and China's ability to supply such goods in vast quantities are the real reasons behind China's success. Consumers in the United States, meanwhile, save between $70 billion to $100 billion a year because they can buy cheaper products from China. They also enjoy lower borrowing costs and easier home ownership because China uses some of its trading surplus to finance the US budget deficit, helping to keep interest rates down. ", "If China didn't buy the US Treasury Bonds, the United States would be obliged to borrow in the open market, pushing the interest rates up and causing private borrowers to pay more. The United States can help itself by keeping budget deficit down, and by exporting goods that China needs. Both Germany and Japan mostly export cars and trucks, heavy machineries, and high-tech products, which China needs. The United States should try to regain a competitive advantage vis-\u00e0-vis Japan and Germany for such goods, instead of opening more McDonald outlets in Beijing and Shanghai.", "The US budget deficit is the result of President George W Bush's misguided policy of tax cut. It may be recalled that when former US President Bill Clinton entered the White House, his first act was to raise taxes on wealthy Americans to stem a runaway budget deficit left behind by earlier Republican administrations. Clinton's tax-hike, denounced by the Republicans as \"a passport to recession,\" balanced the budget, produced a surplus, lowered the long-term interest rate, and triggered the longest economic boom in recent history. Bush has squandered the surplus by his staggering $1.67 trillion tax cut, producing a massive $400 billion deficit. Now China, by lending massive sums, is bankrolling America's budget deficit.", "China's economic and financial clout is underscored by the fact that it has accumulated well over a trillion dollars in US currency reserves, with al least $400 billion of US government treasury notes, and it is now second only to Japan in holding American debt. If China decides to unload the US dollars it possesses, it will have catastrophic implications for the American dollar, which will plummet in value and the interest rate will rise steeply leading to a deep recession. Although China will not do such a thing because it has a stake in the U.S. dollar, the fact that it holds the key to the dollar's stability speaks volumes about its economic prowess. China is also using some of its surplus to provide loans to poor countrries, especially  African countries. ", "With such dependence, America is hardly in a position to bully China. In fact, by trying to paint China as a \"big bad guy,\" the US risks biting the hand that feeds its."], "tag": ["OP-ED"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=1435", "location": null, "date": "2007-08-26"}
{"reporter": "Saad S. Khan", "headline": ["Remembering a unique mutiny"], "lastModified": null, "newsBody": ["This year was the 150th anniversary of the bloody events of 1857.  The year marks the beginning of the end (for 90 years) of South Asia ruled by the sons of soil. The events that followed led the symbolic power change seat from the imperial palace in Delhi to Buckingham Palace in London by 1858. It was then even the Peacock Throne of the Indian emperors as well as the legendary dazzling diamond of the imperial crown, known as Koh-i-Noor (literally: the mount of light) was looted and physically taken to Britain by the mutineers. ", "In this year's commemorations in India and Pakistan, since most of the areas where conflagration started or the heaviest fighting took place, like Delhi, the imperial capital, Agra, Khansi, Ahmadabad and Meerut, lie in present day India, celebrations there were much more emotional. ", "Tens of thousands of Indian people marched from Meerut to Agra to trace the path of the imperial troops who came to succor the ailing emperor, exactly 150 years ago, and had declared his sovereignty over the whole of India. ", "At the Red Fort in Delhi, the prime minister of India Manmohan Singh addressed the celebration and paid rich tributes to the warriors of 1857 who laid down their lives for the defense of the empire. The prime minister reminded the South Asians that it was in the true spirit of inter-faith unity between Muslims and Hindus that all came together to defend the emperor who was a Muslim. In fact, all the seven major dynasties that ruled India since it started its journey towards a political unity had been Muslim ones. ", "In Pakistan, the National Commission for Historical and Cultural Research held a widely attended symposium in which the historians debated the causes and effects of the war and its real nature. President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz of Pakistan also in their messages paid rich tributes to the defenders of South Asia who tried to resist impending colonization of their land and tried to sustain the moribund empire from the Western powers' \"scramble for Asia.\" Calls were made to make a monument to remember the countless heroes and heroines, five hundred thousands of whom were butchered mercilessly by British troops after the defeat of the emperor who was exiled to Rangoon, where he died and got buried five years later in 1862. It was also demanded that the remains of the emperor be brought back and re-buried with full military honours either in India or in Pakistan. ", "The British call the war of 1857 as the great Mutiny. Mutiny, it definitely was, but not a \"great\" one. It was a mutiny of British officers of the company in the service of the Indian emperor against him, and not the other way round. That is why I have chosen the word \"unique\" for this mutiny since it is the first major mutiny the facts of which have been so disfigured by the new British rulers that our own textbooks sixty years after independence still call it as a mutiny of the Indian emperor against his British servants/subjects. What a mutilation and dishonesty towards history as well as a linguistic paradox. Mutiny is a rebellion by servants against master. A master cannot be said to be rebelling against servants. ", "Let us understand the nature of the 1857 war first. In many parts of the Indian empire, it had been a franchise issue just like the governance itself in the last century of the imperial rule had been. Most provinces were fully or semi-independent and owed little or nominal allegiance to the emperor at Delhi. This all changed when the subjects of the emperor felt the existential threat to the empire due to the division and fragmentation. Bakht Khan, a military general from the independent state of Awdh, descended in and defended Delhi, while taking over the command of the imperial forces on the emperor's behalf. The Rani of Jhansi, Satay Ram, Maulvi Ahmadullah Khan, and many local political and military leaders rose to the occasion, professed their allegiance to the emperor and tried to expel the rapacious British servants of the East India Company from the India soil. It is a misfortunate that neither in India nor in Pakistan, any of the top military medals is named after the military heroes of the 1857 war.", "Now, let us shed some light on theoretical part, on war's historiography, that is. 1857 was not a war of independence for the Indians since the British had not conquered India till that point in time. True, the Company was ruling three presidencies but that was area-wise less than one tenth of India, and in fact, even there it was ruling and collecting the taxes in the name of emperor to whom they paid an annual tribute. ", "Till as late as 1835, Persian had remained the imperial language for the court and the country and official one for the Company too. The Company's so-called governor of Bengal paid ritual obeisance to the emperor every year. The emperor's was the de jure government and Company was exercising de facto delegated authority mainly on revenue and law and order matters in a limited part of his domains. ", "Same was the case of around 564 other rulers, sultans, dukes and princes, who were ruling their own mini-kingdoms within the empire. Bahadur Shah Zafar, the 38th ruler of united India and the 17th and the last one from the Mughul dynasty, was on the throne. ", "At the beginning of the outbreak of hostilities, history tells us, the old and ailing poet-emperor was not hopeful of winning the war to expel the British intruders, but seeing the zeal of his subjects, he gave in and accepted to lead them as their symbolic head. Since it was the emperor who wanted to get rid of the British, it would be frivolous to call it as an independence struggle since emperor is not supposed to be getting \"independence\" from disloyal subjects. We can call his campaign as the one of retribution towards his British subjects who had shown seditionist tendencies, i.e. the officers of the British East India Trading Company that was operating under a license by the great ancestor of the incumbent, Emperor Shah Jehan in consideration of medical help that the British doctors had provided in a serious burn injury to a princess. ", "It may be recalled that Indian sub-continent boasts of one of the oldest civilisations of the known history. The Indus valley civilisation whose relics are found in Punjab province of what is now Pakistan, date back to 2500 BC when people lived in properly designed urban settlements and were fairly advanced in arts and learning. The Arab Muslims first conquered and annexed parts of India between 668 to 712 AD. The latter date marks the conquest of Deebal a town near the present day Karachi, now a bustling port metropolis of 12 million people, by the Arabs. Between 998 and 1030 AD the Afghans, who had by then turned Muslims under Sultan Mahmood of Gazna, invaded India seventeen times for plunder. By 1206, the Muslims had captured Delhi and at least the northern half of the sub-continent had become a political unity under Sultan Qutbuddin Aibak, the first Muslim ruler of Delhi and the founder of slaves' dynasty. The rule continued for around seven centuries under successive dynasties like the Tughlaqs, the Khiljis, the Syeds, the Lodhis, and the Suris. It was under the Mughals that the whole of India came under a single rule. By the early 19th century, anarchy and chaos best described Indian political landscape. A trading company, named East India Comapny became powerful and a time came that even the emperor was apprehensive of its power. Though the trouble started with Indian soldiers of the Company over the use of gun-lids allegedly made of cow fat, but once the emperor saw his opportunity to throw his weight behind and try to get rid of the British it became a national struggle. Now it was emperor and his loyalists fighting against the ones, whom the emperor wanted out of his realms. ", "Let's un-write the British-centric history of the 1857 war and let's unread their interpretation. Let us call it a mutiny on board HMS (sic) Indian empire, where the British servants mutinied, captured the palace, deposed the emperor, murdered the crown prince and four other princes, and than went on to slay countless of men and women on the streets in cold blood. The Company captured the Red Fort and turned for political guidance to Windsor Castle which decided to annex India to British domains and company's rule ended no sooner had it formally began.  British rule had some positive effects, but, by and large, it was a 90 year-long spell of oppression and suppression.

However, the authorities concerned took swift and proper action to arrest the protests that subsequently  took place from developing into anything more.

", "In addition, the uncertainty of legitimising their decisions by the next parliament is also agitating its thoughts.", "Truly speaking, this government is surviving on the good will of the common people. If the people get any wrong signal because of some indiscreet acts of its partner armed forces (or the police, for that matter) the ability of the government to remain effective will be lessened. ", "People are silent because they are watching and waiting for election. Failure of CTG would lead to a grave crisis. Thus, no provocative action can be allowed by the government. All out efforts may be taken to cool down the rage of the students and teachers of DU through consultation among student leaders, vice chancellor and teachers, senior army officers, and designated adviser of CTG immediately. Such consultation brooks no delay.", "The armed forces may realise that it is a tricky business when they are doing something even for the benefit of the people, because in doing such jobs they may be hurting the interest of some people who will certainly try to obstruct them so that they are spared of their possible loss. The government knows well that due to its strong drive some corrupt but powerful people have been badly affected financially and socially. These people are either serving sentences, or under trial or absconding or their charge-sheets are under proper processing. Some extortionists are either hiding or under trial. Their lifestyle has been badly affected.", "It is fairly clear that some major parties may lose their supporters because of increasing exposure of misdeeds like corruption, extortion, land-grabbing, tax evasion or illegal arms handling of some of their stalwarts. As such, they may try hard for failure of the government as early as possible. They may have even approached some law makers in certain countries such as US, UK, Canada and Germany with cooked up facts and figures to convinced them about abuse of human rights by the CTG. They may not even hesitate trying to stop remittance of Bangladeshi expatriates. It is reported that Khaleda Zia has advised some BNP activists abroad to agitate for release of her son Tarique Rahman.", "It would be unjust if we ignore the contributions of students from 1940s. In fact Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was a front-ranking student leader till 1947. In the liberation movement of Bangladesh the students not only actively participated in large numbers they also made great sacrifice in the war. ", "Even a dictator like Ziaur Rahman paid due importance to the students who could organise them as the largest and the strongest student body in Bangladesh. In throwing out dictator Ershad, the students played the dominant role. Thus, students are intimately involved in restoring democracy for which the CTG and the armed forces are now striving hard. ", "The Chhatra Sangram Parishad has come up with the following demands:", "It is learnt that teachers of DU have agreed with the demands of the students. One of the difficulties in handling this incident is that the armed forces are not under the chief adviser. They are under the president, as per the provision of our constitution. However, we do not think it may pose any big problem because this government is jointly run by civilians and the military. Both are responsible for successful running of the government. ", "It is reported that both army and police have already been withdrawn from the DU campus. They are, however, patrolling the campus from outside. The demand for free treatment of injured students appears to be reasonable. As for disciplinary action against the accused army personnel, the army will doubtless take the necessary steps. In regard to lifting of emergency, it may be little delayed due to this ominous incident because it is reported that the students were joined by a number of displaced vendors, hawkers, small shopkeepers and college students. ", "In view of the grim situation, the CTG did not have any other option except to impose curfew in Dhaka city and five other divisional headquarters. Needless to say that if no peaceful atmosphere prevail during the preparation of the voter list, election may be delayed and commitment of holding election by December 2008 may not be possible. ", "Thus our fervent appeal will be to all concern to remain calm and cool during the coming 16 months. We wish to utilise the opportunity (under the CTG) to banish the land-grabbers, tree-cutters (officials of forest department), constructers of illegal structures, and tax evaders.

While the Treaty of Westphalia heralded the end of the Thirty Years' War (1618-48) among European Princely states, and of the anarchic and non-regulatory  inter-state affairs existing in Europe at that time, the UN Charter was framed with the hope that, thenceforth, inter-state wars would be banished forever. ", "The Organization of African Unity formed in 1963 held respect for borders as sacrosanct. The 1975 Helsinki Final Act expressed the view that \"frontiers can only be changed in accordance with international law, by peaceful means and by agreement.\" The basis of the Dayton Agreement between Bosnia-Herzogovina, Croatia, and Serbia was full respect to sovereign equality of the contracting parties. But the European Union, though a \"union of sovereign states,\" has become an organization in which member states have limited their sovereign rights in certain areas. ", "The reason the international community has remained so sensitive to the sanctity of sovereignty is that if secession is allowed unchecked then an anarchic situation would prevail in the world, threatening international peace and security. The Bangladesh liberation war received international legitimacy because it was not regarded as secession, like Biafra's attempt to secede from Nigeria despite widespread death and destruction that the Biafran war caused. The Bangladesh case was accepted as the right of self-determination of all the people as a fundamental human right, and also because of the genocide committed by the Pakistan army in then East Pakistan. In the case of Biafra, the African States' orthodoxy that only former colonies could gain independence and form states stood in the way of the wish of the people of Biafra to be independent of Nigeria.", "The world, however, has changed from the values of freedom propagated by the US during the cold war to oppose the communist menace that the Western world feared would be embraced by the developing countries. The end of the cold war and the demise of the Soviet Union, and consequent spread of democracy in the former Soviet colonies, described as the third wave of democratic promotion by Samuel Huntington, interpreted by some analysts as inevitable because they felt that the erstwhile Soviet colonies were spiritually geared towards democracy that was rooted in their culture and that authoritarianism was foreign to them (one should not forget Soviet invasions of Hungary and Czechoslovakia), the drive by the West for defense of values of liberal democracy has now been enshrined in their foreign and defense policies. ", "The tragedies of Rwanda, Srebenica, and Darfur, as in many other African countries, have given a push to the doctrine of the responsibility to protect.  Paul Taylor (Sovereignty at the Millennium) has expounded the doctrine as the obligation by the sovereign states to the international community of their accountability for the license of sovereignty given to them. The states must be prepared to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the international community continued adherence to the rule of law, respect to human rights( in particular to those of the minority community), and democratic practices. The same doctrine has been enunciated by Gareth Evans, co-chair of the International Commission on Intervention, and Tony Blair in his doctrine of International Community that he advocated to explain the Nato bombing of Serbia.", "The UN World Summit of 2005 embraced for the first time the doctrine of the responsibility to protect, thus compressing the concept of unimpeachable  sovereignty that the world had been used to since the UN Charter came into being. The problem arises with a misadventure like the invasion of Iraq, firstly on the premise of Saddam Hussein's readiness to strike the West with weapons of mass destruction and his links with Al-Qaeda, that proved to be false, and later to change Saddam Hussein's brutal regime and gift the Iraqis with democracy, which effectively resulted in a fractured Iraq immersed in internecine and sectarian strife, leading the country to a possible disintegration into three parts.", "The Iraqi election of 2005 was directed more at establishing Shia supremacy over the Sunnis than attempting to establish democratic rights for an essentially tribal society owing primordial allegiance to tribal traditions. The lessons learnt from the Iraqi episode, and the reluctance of countries of the broader Middle East to embrace pluralism, give merit to Francis Fukuyama's thesis that democracy constituting the \"end point of man kind's ideological evolution\" needs a certain level of economic development for sustainability. India, the largest democracy in the world, has somehow proved to be an exception to the conditions generally believed to be necessary for sustaining democracy.", "The American concern, indeed the global concern of the 21st century, is to confront terrorism in all its forms. The locus of this evil, generally identified as rooted in Islamic extremism, is not only to be found in the West but in the developing countries of the East as well, which were no less victims of the Islamic extremists. These deviants from Islam believe many Muslim countries to be equally guilty of transgressing the limit of what they believe to be the \"purist\" form of Islam, like the West that has degenerated into a permissive society, thereby contaminating Muslim societies. But then, it would be na\u00efve to ignore that the stringent drive by the Bush administration to rid the world of \"all evils\" through hard power has resulted in the anti-US feeling that has become a global epidemic.", "This year's Pew Research Center Global attitude survey of 45,000 people in 47 countries has shown pervasive disapproval of US foreign policy, widespread opposition to President Bush, and worsening anti-Americanism in the last five years. The uncaring attitude of the present US leaders about the global issues beyond security has resulted in anti-Americanism not only in the Islamic countries but also in Europe, Canada( 83% feel that America ignores their interest), Japan and South Korea. Though seen through a different prism in 1842, Charles Dickens found Americans \"rude, addicted to sharp business practices, hypocritical about liberty in the light of their treatment of blacks, and careless about where they spit tobacco.\"", "The Democratic party's presidential nomination seeker Barack Obama's controversial remark about military assault on Al-Qaeda camps in Pakistan, if necessary without the approval of the Pakistani authorities, also repeated by his rivals Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, appears to be a reiteration of the Bush doctrine of preemption, or intended application of Professor Michael Byers' theory of exceptional illegality that would permit states to violate international law in truly exceptional situations where a serious threat exists and the UNSC remains frozen. ", "It has been argued that under the regime of customary international law, developed long before the UN Charter was framed, it was generally agreed that preemptive force in self-defense was acceptable as long as the state exercising the right of preemption could demonstrate its necessity, and the use of force was proportionate to the threat. To prevent a threat to international peace and security from maturing, the narrow view of inviolability of national frontiers should be ignored, preferably with the sanction of the UNSC or, if needed, without it. Admittedly small and weak developing countries with failing governance would be up in arms against any such intrusion. But in cases where diplomatic and economic engagements fail to cure the anarchy, with spill-over effects in neighbouring countries (e.g. Darfur and DR Congo), then the global hegemons may, in the teeth of opposition of liberal democrats, have no option but to use hard power."], "tag": ["Editorial"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=1429", "location": null, "date": "2007-08-26"}

It is a gesture of personal peeve, contrary to the ethos of governance, which must at all times be an expression of collective will. There are some unusual occasions that become even more demanding, as in the case of the Indo-US nuclear deal, when a decision must be raised above the limitations of executive authority and sifted through a national consensus, for it commits the nation to a course of action stretching ahead through four or five decades. ", "Ronen Sen, India's ambassador to the United States, has sullied a long and distinguished career by an uncharacteristic outburst that reeks of personal frustration. Whether he will enter the history books remains to be seen. But I fear that his description of the deal's critics as \"headless chicken\" will enter that vast vault in which the foreign ministry's memory bank is stored. ", "Sen did little for his reputation by compounding his mistake with a clumsy lie when he \"clarified\" that he was referring to the media rather than MPs. Most of the media has, in fact, been supportive of his deal, and, in Sen parlance, the greater proportion of journalists thereby fall into the category of chicken with heads. In any case, journalists cannot stop such a deal. Members of Parliament can. ", "An interview, particularly one which has the stamp of a command performance, often reveals far more than it sets out to convey. The discerning try and read between the lines. But it is also useful to read behind the lines, into the mind of the nabob giving the interview. Stress and vehemence, for instance, are clues to motive, or a hint towards the next step being taken. The Ronen Sen interview should be read carefully for reasons other than the use of an unhappy phrase. ", "There is, by now, a familiar pattern in pro-deal arguments that breaks down with a little analysis of inbuilt contradictions. I shall give only one example. Sen asserts that every concern about guaranteed nuclear fuel supplies has been met. He then goes on to stress that the Hyde Act, signed into American law by President George Bush, will govern American decisions. (We have accepted this qualification in the 123 Agreement.) The Hyde Act clearly specifies that fuel supplies will be conditional upon clearance from the American Congress, which will require a certification of good behaviour by India across a range of issues. ", "It is possible that the government might float another line (already put into limited circulation) during the debates in Parliament: that a bilateral treaty takes precedence over American domestic law. This is self-deception, to use the kindest phrase. If this is true, why was the law needed in the first place? The government of India has repeatedly characterised Hyde as the \"enabling legislation\" on the deal, which of course it is. After the 123 Agreement was signed on July 23, Nicholas Burns, undersecretary of state and the chief American negotiator, said, on record, that \"we kept reminding the Indian side, and they were good enough to negotiate on this basis, that anything we did had to fall within, and respect, the legal guidelines that Congress had set forth.\" Those legal guidelines are what is known as the Hyde Act. ", "Negotiators on both sides are agreed, and have said so publicly, that the agreement must live within the parameters set by Hyde. Delhi has said that no provision of the Hyde Act has been breached in the agreement. How many more times do we need to hear such plain language in order to understand the import? ", "Sen also rules out any renegotiation of Hyde. This \"cannot even be considered.\" If nothing can be altered, then it makes a nonsense of the government's current argument that the next stage of discussions, in Vienna with the IAEA and later with the Nuclear Suppliers Group, should be allowed to proceed while the Left's concerns are addressed. The Vienna talks are, in fact, an operationalisation of the 123 Agreement, since they are a consequence of its provisions. The outcome of these talks will be amicable, since that is pre-arranged. ", "Perhaps the most revealing part of this interview, done by Aziz Haniffa, is the section in which Sen's name does not figure. ", "The interview is divided into two parts. In the first, Sen is quoted directly. Then, mysteriously, the quotes are attributed to \"senior diplomatic observers,\" named once in the plural and once in the singular. These \"senior diplomatic observer/s\" are happy to be quoted, but very nervous about being identified. Why? Will they be imprisoned in Guantanamo because they are saying that no future government can abrogate this deal? Why were their quotes added to a Ronen Sen interview? Would it be wrong to surmise that these quotes came from Sen as well, but he requested that his name be kept out since he was being critical of a particular political party and calling its position a \"childish tantrum?\" ", "This unnamed but very senior diplomatic \"observer\" named the BJP, but he should have been even more wary of the communists. It is their opposition that has stopped the nuclear deal. The government made a serious miscalculation in its reading of the Left. Just because the CPI(M) supported a Congress-led government three years ago, it does not mean that the CPI(M) had become a wing of the Congress. The CPI(M) remains an ideological party, and there is a limit that it cannot cross without compromising its raison d'\u00eatre. The Left's concern extends to the \"strategic partnership\" that is being developed by this government with the United States.", "What is interesting is the belligerence with which the \"senior diplomatic observers\" condemned any thought of the deal being abrogated by a successor government. ", "This fits in with the latest strategy being pursued in some circles of the Delhi government. ", "The thinking is that Dr Manmohan Singh should go ahead and sign the deal, even though he has lost the support of the Left on this issue. The alliance with the Left is dead for all political purposes, so why become hostage to its demands? However, there are still two stages of negotiations left before the deal can be inked. They can be hurried through with American assistance, but it will still need time, perhaps eight weeks or so. Till then, the Left needs to be placated, or hoodwinked, with the argument that these interim discussions do not amount to an operationalisation of the deal. The Left has set the condition that it will withdraw support only when the deal becomes operational. The deal will become operational, it will be argued, with various degrees of ingeniousness, only when the prime minister of India signs a document, either with Bush or the American secretary of state Condoleezza Rice. ", "The worst that the Left can do at that stage is withdraw support, but the Congress will be ready to go to the country on the strength of this \"achievement.\" The prime minister is convinced that he will obtain nationwide support for the partnership with America, and that he can lead his redesigned coalition back to power after an early general election. Further, he will not be hampered by leftist baggage in the future. In any case, since no future government can renegotiate what has been signed, the deal will survive even if the present government does not. ", "India was shining for the last government.

Lack of proper planning, mismanagement, and mindless plundering were largely responsible for the dimming gloss of the golden fiber that was once the largest foreign currency earner of the country.", "Though the country's climate is very much suitable for growing jute, the environment-friendly natural fiber, the farmers are losing interest in growing it. Farmers who still grow jute cultivate it only on those lands that are not suitable for growing any other crop during that  season. The indiscriminate closure of jute mills has a snowballing effect on jute cultivation.", "The government nationalised the jute industries along with other industrial units, and the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC) started its journey in 1972 with 77 jute mills set up in the pre-liberation period. Following the sweeping nationalisation, the non-Bangladeshi owners, technical experts, and skilled manpower left the country. As a result, a serious vacuum was created in the jute mills.", "On the other hand, the government appointed some inefficient persons with dubious character to run these jute mills. Eventually, the government was compelled to denationalise 35 jute mills between 1982 and 1985. Another 24 state-run jute mills faced closure at different times due to various factors, including mismanagement and rampant corruption. In fact, that was the beginning of the end of the jute era. ", "The World Bank (WB) is also blamed for the miserable state of our jute sector. The WB formulated the Jute Sector Reform Programme in 1991, and promised to provide $250 million to the government to implement it. The main objective of the reform was to privatise all the nationalised jute mills and find ways to make country's jute sector viable.", "But the WB provided only $50 million, the first tranche of the loan, and stopped payment of the remaining $200 million on the plea of slow action in the privatisation process. Such unfair treatment by the WB only made the ailing jute sector more vulnerable.", "The government also formulated a number of policies to revitalise the jute sector, but all were in vain. The policies include signing of an agreement with the WB, titled Jute Sector Adjustment Credit (JSAC), in 1994. The objectives of the JSAC were revitalising the jute sector through privatization, restructuring debt, decreasing the number of labourers and looms, and upgrading technologies. The WB has so far provided Tk 1,500 crore to the government in loan under the JSAC. But the JSAC could not revive the jute sector.", "There exists a strong perception that the WB put pressure on the government to shut-down Adamjee jute mills, and is now promoting India's jute industries by downsizing our jute sector. India set up four new jute mills after the closure of Adamjee, and another three under- construction mills will go into operation soon, raising the total number to 92.", "A big jute park on 152 acres of land near Kolkata is also going to be set up soon to cope with the growing demand for jute products in the global markets. India's Jute Compulsory Use Act facilitates the sales of jute bags in their local market by imposing restrictions on the use of all other packaging materials for grains.   ", " It was the utter misfortune of the nation to watch woefully the closure of world's largest jute mill, which was the pride of the country, on July 1, 2002. The smooth operation of Adamjee jute mills during the post-liberation period was hampered largely due to political interference, mismanagement, and corruption. The people in power utilized the unit for their own purposes, without taking any initiative for saving the country's most vital industrial unit.  ", "Bangladesh had dominated the global trade in jute for many years in the past, with 85 percent share in raw jute export and 65 percent share in jute goods export. The total quantity of hessian, sacking, and CBC produced in 1972-73 was over 450,000 tons, which grew to about 563,000 tons in 1982-83. But the production of these jute goods dwindled to about 242,000 tons in 2005-06 due to lack of pro-active policy support, sheer negligence, and indiscriminate closure of jute mills.", "Bangladesh is now fast losing its foreign jute markets to India. The hasty decision to shut-down four jute mills in Khulna just on the ground of incurring losses was detrimental to the overall jute sector. Bangladesh lost a large volume of business in Ghana, Syria, Iran, and Sudan, as the buyers from these countries were apprehensive because of the closure of jute mills and were doubtful about delivery of the goods on time. These buyers have now moved to India.", "A comparison of our jute exports with India's reveals that Bangladesh exported 14 lakh tons of jute goods in 1990, while India's share was only six tons, against 30 lakh tons of global demand. But the situation has been totally reversed now. The global demand for jute and jute goods has risen to 50 lakh tons, and India has seized the major markets. Bangladesh has failed to cope with the growing demand for jute goods in the world market with only 22 jute mills, as out of 82 mills 60 have already been closed.", "The UN has declared 2009 as the International Natural Fiber Year. Bangladesh must not miss this golden opportunity to tap the full industrial potential of jute, which is widely known as a versatile and ecologically safe natural fiber.", " A world-wide movement is currently on to find a substitute for wood as raw material for paper. Paper pulp can be produced from jute, a system which was evolved through successful completion of a project called Biotechnical Application of Enzymes. Paper pulp made of natural fiber like jute was sure to draw the attention of all in today's environment-conscious world. Unfortunately, there was no further development of the project.", "Bangladesh's jute industry, the biggest producer and exporter of jute goods in the global market, is now regarded as a \"sunset industry.\" Ironically, the jute sector in India has flourished tremendously over the past few years, while it declined alarmingly in Bangladesh. Really, our jute sector is now at its last gasp, and all because of wrong policies, mismanagement, and rampant corruption.", "The sun has not yet set fully. In our view, there still are possibilities for bringing back the lost glory of our golden fiber. All we need is the right policy, and its uncorrupted enforcement. Substantial rethinking by the caretaker government is the need of the hour for rejuvenation of our jute sector, without going for indiscriminate closure of jute mills.

We speak of the difficulties that weavers have been going through over the last several years. As a report in yesterday's issue of this newspaper makes it clear, as many as 50,000 handlooms have been forced into inactivity in Tangail owing to the economic problems that weavers face. Those problems centre around the abnormally high prices of the materials they need to produce their goods. Essentially, it has been high cost yarn and dye that have forced many weavers in Tangail off their trade. ", "In such places as Pabna and Sirajganj, the weaving industry has been badly affected by the floods, to a point where 100,000 weavers are now in grave difficulties as they have incurred losses to the tune of Tk. 62 crore. An immediate response from the authorities is therefore of paramount importance. In a condition where traditional trade is in many areas dying out or is being pushed out altogether (and here we note the predicament the jute sector finds itself in), it becomes critically important that the heritage yet in place be preserved. Some meaningful steps such as a rehabilitation of weavers who cannot reasonably go back to their profession must be taken. Then comes the matter of those weavers badly affected by the floods. Their hardship can be alleviated to some extent through arranging bank loans on easy terms for them. Let the modalities for such rehabilitation and loans be worked out by the authorities. Additionally, the allegations made about the existence of a syndicate responsible for the rise in prices of weaving-related material must be thoroughly investigated and the culprits brought to book. Again, the argument the aggrieved weavers have made in favour of import of yarn and dye makes sense as such a step will give them a chance to go back to their trade through not having to depend on local syndicates for the materials in question.

Langley; Dhaka: Nazrul Institute; February 2007", "In April 2001 going through Volume 6 of the Nazrul Institute Journal, the irregular English publication from the institute, I came upon an essay by Winston E. Langley called 'Kazi Nazrul Islam and the Voice of Poetry in the Affairs of Humankind'. I read it time and again. I was amazed at the way he had evaluated Nazrul--in a very different and comparative way, which was inconceivable earlier. The idea in that essay has now been more elaborately and analytically presented in the book ", "Professor Langley teaches international relations and political science at Massachusetts University, Boston, USA. As Dr. Rafiqul Islam, the chairman of the Nazrul Institute trustee board, states in the foreword: \u201cLangley became interested in Kazi Nazrul Islam in the year 1996 when he attended a Nazrul evening at one of the Bangladeshi friend's house in Boston. His interest in Nazrul grew when he had the opportunity, for the first time, to listen to a few Nazrul songs.\u201d Langley writes in his preface that \u201cFirst, I was introduced to Nazrul's music and felt as if I was totally penetrated emotionally and aesthetically. I, therefore, sought to find out more about him by reading some of his poetry as well as some articles about his personal history. Intrigued, I decided to prepare a paper on what I had discovered.\u201d ", "Prof. Rafiqul Islam rightly termed Langley as the first Western scholar to study Nazrul.  It would also not be wrong to state that he is the first critic who has ventured to examine Nazrul and his literature in a very novel perspective. He has evaluated how Nazrul's work can be worthy even in the era of globalisation. In his own fashion, Langley has argued why Nazrul is not a nationalist, how Nazrul came across the borders of nationalism and extended his horizon worldwide that is termed as globalism today (Nazrul: The Global Citizen). In another essay Langley critically noted the aspects of development, i.e., \u201cthe gaining of capabilities which frees one to act\u201d and comments that Nazrul understood that development \u201cwas not confined to economic matters\u201d (Development and Globalism, p.141). \u201cNazrul saw development as broadly cultural, and that is why, whether he was pointing to the actions of literary or scientific intellectuals, or to the efforts of political leaders in their joint or several pursuit of development, he sought to emphasise that practices, tastes, and ways of life are a part of a people's identity be respected,\u201d ( p.146).", "But the sorry saga is that, as is the general fate of almost all English language publications here, the book contains some printing and other mistakes which could possibly have been avoided. No doubt, this book will create a new flow in the otherwise clich\u00e9-bound school of Nazrul criticism. Here it is worth mentioning that the book must come out in Bangla version as well.

Partha has no job and lives off his parents. While he does have a close group of friends that he goes to movies and parties with, he continually feels alienated from them as he sees them move further and further away from him in terms of their professional and social life. His lack of experience in the real world is something that Partha fails to recognize, and at times sneers at, as he puts himself above such things. However, his detachment from the humdrum workings of society and the distance he feels from others his age nonetheless creates a void within him that he attempts to fill making verbose entries into his journals, drinking incessantly and falling into the company of the romantic Ahmadi sahib and the infuriatingly patronizing Kaushik. To them, Partha vents his frustrations at the world, giving them an excuse for their pseudo-intellectual, quasi-senile ruminations. Considering himself above the masses and droves of people who go to work everyday succumbing to the world's mundanity-- Partha is happy to ignore the fact that he has become part of the hoi polloi who are unemployed! He does not manage to find a vocation in life throughout the novel!  ", "I suppose the biggest problem with this novel is that the chief protagonist is not memorable - a serious problem considering that the novel is mostly about him and his thoughts! It is not possible to say that he is likable, or that he is despicable or that his troubles will haunt the mind for any significant period of time. This novel attempts to explore the feelings and thoughts of a young man facing a new, grimy, hypocritical world and it provides some insight into why he would feel this way. However, all it most persuasively manages to do is leave a bland aftertaste. ", "The writing is overwrought. The writer is trapeze-ing between indeterminate moods and styles. On one page the hero is twentieth-century over-sensitive \u201canti-fashion\u201d (p.9) man sniggering at the world and himself (I suspect) and on the next page he seems to gung-ho into nineteenth-century soul-wrenching swoons--now he is stomping and swearing, now he is the weary sophist burdened with bile and melancholia. The wild swings are impossible for the reader to keep up with and made infinitely more nerve-wrecking because Sriram's novel is a trap for flighty philosophical profundities, obtuse diary entries, cringing conversations, cryptic asides, non-doings and a voluble death wish. The book - I am looking for a polite word here - was 'tiresome'. Not because the subject was a bleak one but because it thrashes a bleak subject to death.  ", "The reveries are possibly intended to show the hero's mind as a cauldron of images and random sensations. When one has tired of Partha's tedious prose: wounds are wounds when you're hurt, and their memory lasts--like sense-memory! Fear, like rust, seeps and corrodes. So much energy and feeling: expended to what end? Oh, thinking is useless! And purposeless! The sheer chaos of reality warrants no reflection! Experience doesn't give perspective: experience is opaque! (p.89), there are unwarranted surprises, like TWO whole pages on how repulsive lizards are. And then there are other ordeals - for example, the heated exchange that a young woman (and Partha's love interest) Akanksha has with her crusty mother on getting the maid to make kofta and coleslaw. Sixty or so pages on to the book, I was about to give up, sadly concluding that ", " is a bizarre mash. Kofta and coleslaw.", "However, I did read on and slowly realized that the book had taken on an ambitious theme which, had it been done with less fuss and a more defined sense of purpose, could have been something to talk about. What redeems the book is Sriram's wry understanding of human relationships - not his excruciating study of ennui smothered with Rilke, Keats, Wordsworth, mystics, Khayyam and so on. He is able to zero in on facets of yuppie life that strains credulity (I can't imagine in what kind of a world an interior designer comes to a party dressed as Mary Poppins or someone dressed as Spiderman shoots gelatinous stuff from a hose) - granted this is very, very weird but somehow the sections where Sriram is more readable are where he stops pontificating and writes in a clean, no-nonsense prose - for example, about Mr. and Mrs. Dutt's marital life. Or about a harried young man called Shaurab who is unsure whether he is still in a relationship even though he is in a furniture shop with his girlfriend who is browsing for beds and coasters. I was still counting how many pages I had left to reach the end, but I was ok with a writer who writes \"hormones do for love what it does for acne\" or \u201cshe made him happy, so she controlled his happiness\u201d. If one is patient, one is rewarded by sections that are not jaunty hype but written with 'pleasant' (Sriram loves this word!) ease."], "tag": ["Literature"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=1339", "location": null, "date": "2007-08-25"}

Increasing waste generation in the present time is associated with voracious consumer culture and human greed, which have done irreparable damage to the environment. ", "Human activities generate wastes. Most of these wastes are normally solid and the meaning of the word waste suggests that the material is useless and unwanted. But many of these waste materials can be reused and thus can become a resource. Environmental pollution due to waste, whatever may its source be, has reached menacing dimensions. The wastes associated with environmental problems have revealed that greater emphasis must be given to the management of urban solid wastes and their by products.", "The solid wastes generated from different sources are highly heterogeneous in their physical, chemical and biological properties and call for different methods for their safe disposal. Solid wastes comprise countless number of different components: dust, discarded food, papers and boards, metals, plastics and glass, cloth and furniture, garden wastes, and many hazardous substances. In most cities of Bangladesh, the decomposable organic matter is the major component of the municipal refuse and makes up nearly 70 to 80 percent of it. This component of solid waste when left uncleared starts decomposing emitting foul odour and it also leads to breeding and proliferation of undesirable and disease causing organisms. The most poignant environmental damage caused by solid wastes is to its aesthetics and hygiene. ", "Many people feel that solid waste management is a simple affair -- simply putting it onto a vehicle and unloading at a dump. But successful solid waste management is rarely achieved without thought, effort and learning from mistakes. Solid waste management is much more than a technological issue -- it usually involves managing a large workforce and working closely with the public. Waste generation should be avoided as far as technically possible and economically acceptable, and waste must be recycled unless this is economically not feasible. Low waste technologies deserve priority over customary waste disposal.", "According to Chittagong City Corporation source, the total generation of solid waste from all possible sources (industries, markets, clinics and hospital, households and travellers) is 1069 tons per day. It is mentionable that the amount of solid waste produced from industries and clinics added are negligible. A study was conducted from September 2004 to June 2005 to identify the most potential source and composition of biodegradable solid waste generated in the Chittagong metropolitan area, without which any energy recovery plan from solid waste tends to be trivial. The composition of the domestic source along with their sub-sources (done by systematic sampling) and physical and chemical properties were studied. Pertinent domestic source was found as the most potential (75.75%) biodegradable solid waste, which is a very good sign for its composting.", "Still there is no proper master plan for solid waste management in Bangladesh. Solid waste management is ignored a lot. What happens in the city corporations are just raw dumping of waste collected from all sites in a comparatively low value low land ignoring all the environmental impacts from it. Though some small initiatives are taken but these are insufficient and are not being implemented in proper way. All of these projects and tasks should be coordinated and brought under one master plan.", "There are many factors that vary from place to place and that must be considered in the design of a solid waste management system. Amongst them are: ", "In Chittagong Metropolitan area previously there was no recycling process for the huge amount of solid waste produced but recently one recycling plant has been installed in Halisahar dumping site to produce fuel wood charcoal from freshly dumped wastes. Collecting and processing secondary materials, manufacturing recycled-content products, and then purchasing recycled products creates a circle or loop that ensures the overall success and value of recycling. ", "Considering the nature of the waste, its generation rates, density, composition, moisture content, size, distribution of waste materials, pH level, climatic and geographical situation to recover and recycle acceptable biodegradable materials from agricultural, municipal, institutional, commercial and industrial organic wastes in an environmentally acceptable and cost effective manner, and to produce a marketable end product, we can suggest composting as the recycling procedure for the solid waste management. Composting has the following benefits:", "Conversion of a reusable waste resource to a stable and useful product as a soil amendment and mulch medium; reduction of the pollution potential of organic waste; considerable reduction in organic waste volume and weight enabling more economic handling and utilisation; destruction of various nuisance insect pests; elimination of most pathogenic organisms, rendering a pasteurized compost product; and destruction of the viability of plant seeds, particularly weed and other obnoxious plants."], "tag": ["OP-ED"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=1337", "location": null, "date": "2007-08-25"}

More employment to skill and semi-skilled working force in these countries would reduce the risk of corruption and terrorism. Poverty should not be considered a national or regional affair. It is a global phenomenon. Therefore, developed rich countries in the world should think and do something to stop this unhealthy breeding of corruption and terrorism.

Bangladesh is a poverty stricken and densely populated country of 150 million whose per capita income is approximately $480.", "Of the industries, the ready made garment has distinguished itself as an industry with the highest potential of growth. This particular industry, which accounts for the major share of exports, employs two million young women as they have been increasingly participating in the work force. In Bangladesh, young men and women are increasingly adapting to modern technologies. That is really amazing. ", "Since the development of this industry, Bangladesh has been receiving friendly treatment from major industrial countries of the world, but not from USA, unfortunately. It has been treated unfairly by tariff structure of the United States. Nevertheless exports to the United States has increased manifold and the US turned out to be the biggest destination for Bangladesh's exportable products followed by Germany and the Great Britain. ", "Bangladesh has been enjoying duty free entry into European Union with effect from mid 90's while Bangladesh was granted duty free entry into Canadian markets since 2003, a close door neighbour of USA, although two way trade with Canada stands at 429 million dollars only. Bangladesh exported-goods worth $ 333 million to Canada from 2006 until March, 2007 while she imported from Canada goods worth $ 96 million during the same period.", "From January, 2005 all quota imposing countries have lifted it as per WTO agreement on textile and clothing. This has put Bangladesh along with other LDCs in a competitive environment. The system actually provided security to enter US or European markets. Now Bangladesh has been competing with developed countries like China and India. If tariff on products from LDCs is not withdrawn by USA , the stiff competition will have to be confronted with by the LDCs, including Bangladesh. Possibility of the survival of the garment industry in Bangladesh may appear bleak if we do not keep on improving. ", "The government of the United States has shown magnanimity towards countries in Latin America, the Caribbeans and Africa either by reducing or eliminating tariff on products from these countries. The United States may consider adopting lenient view on the ready made garments, and in particular on products from Bangladesh and save this industry by introducing laws that would reduce or eliminate tariff. Nobel Laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus and representatives from Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association gave testimony to the Senate Finance Committee in May this year to explain the reasons for offering duty-free excess to Bangladesh products in US markets. ", "A bill in the Senate sponsored by Senator Gordon Smith, Republican, along with three other Senators was introduced on January 26, 2005 to accord duty free access to textiles and other exports from 14 least developed countries of Asia and the Pacific region while Congressman Joseph Crowley and Congressman Jim Kolbe placed similar bill in the House of Representatives in February, 2005. ", "Trade, not aid plays a very important role in enhancing bilateral relations and improving the condition of downtrodden people in a poverty-ridden country like Bangladesh. Bangladesh has been receiving aid from the United States since its birth. Presently the flow of aid has been drastically cut. Aid is one of the financial incentives that contribute to the breeding of corruption. Hundreds of politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen are facing the consequences now in Bangladesh.", "Bangladesh is exporting ready made garment and frozen food to and importing cotton and machinery from the United States. Both countries benefit from this trading. Bangladesh is following the market economy and conducting reforms in macroeconomic policies as noted by World Trade Organisation in its 2006 Report. In the field of micro credit, the Grameen Bank has brought revolution by strengthening the social and economic position of women, especially in rural areas. If the flow of trade increases, it will benefit both countries.", "Further scope of expansion of industries and opening up of back up industries, such as more spinning mills and accessories factories exists. These intricate global trade developments and relationships create jobs and wealth. In the case of Bangladesh, it would increase employment opportunity and take young men and women off the streets and channel them into productive and meaningful lives.

In some cases, significant progress has been made in combating natural disasters but, by and large, people remain only spectators before nature that can cause devastating losses.", "It is a matter of common knowledge that South Asia, along with adjacent regions in South East Asia, is a disaster-prone area, and the countries here have had enough of the onslaughts of severe proportions in recent history. Catastrophic floods, storms, hurricanes, droughts, earthquakes, and other colossal problems caused by the whims of nature are a regular phenomenon in this part of the world, while many other regions are also vulnerable to various disasters. ", "An early warning system, adequate pre-calamity preparedness, and a speedy post-disaster management system are some of the measures that can definitely reduce the chances, and more importantly lessen the scale, of devastation likely to be wrought by the disaster. It is not that these possibilities are not being thought of, or efforts are not being made in this line, to save the calamity-prone nations as far as possible. But what is urgently needed is a more serious attempt in that direction on the basis of utmost priority, and placement of resources, even if there is constraint on part of the countries that desperately need protection from natural disasters. It appears that such a drive is somewhat lacking, even though there is no dearth of anxiety and concern as well as talk of probable steps to mitigate the causes and consequences.", "Not long ago, the tsunami tragedy, which occurred just before the scheduled 13th summit brought to the fore once again the dire need of anti-disaster measures on a regional plane, and this has received particular attention since the occurrence of unimaginable magnitude that took the lives of more than a quarter million hapless people in South and South East Asia. The Tsunami that struck mainly three South and two South-east Asian nations, leaving a trail of devastation, caused postponement of the summit .Indeed, such a postponement was the logical development of the situation caused by the disaster. ", "In the past, Saarc summits had been deferred several times owing to man-made crises like political problems among the member states and, hence, there was no reason why the event should not have been called off temporarily when nature had inflicted three of its seven members and friendly nations of nearby areas. The nations affected by the disaster obviously needed to focus on domestic relief operations at that critical hour of national tragedy. The summit took place later, and it was heartening to note that when the leaders met the issue of the natural disaster was fresh in their minds, and the tsunami figured prominently in the discussions in the context of natural disasters causing huge destruction in the region.", "Bangladesh is vulnerable to natural disasters, which are highlighted by the catastrophes of 1970, 1988, 1998, and other occasions. Our country is often described as calamity prone by the international world, and the world conference on disaster management in Kobe, Japan, two years ago focused especially on the hardships caused by nature in such nations. The conference was participated by most of the world's countries, and opened by no less a person than the Emperor of Japan as a rare gesture. The former chief of the UNHCR, Dr.Sadako Ogata, was an attraction in the high profile event which drew world-wide attention. The Bangladesh delegation was given importance as a disaster-prone nation.", "The 13th Saarc summit in the Bangladesh capital, coming almost immediately after that global conference, picked up the thread of that conference suiting the regional requirement and priorities. This idea was beneficial for individual nations as well as collectively. It goes without saying that a venture like disaster prevention in South Asia needs collective endeavour, and larger international support and assistance are also required for the purpose. It can be concluded that international help will not be absent, as evidenced by the fact that the sympathy demonstrated in the aftermath of Asia's tsunami was more appealing in the Western nations, particularly among the people, whose hearts went out in consolation with the dead and affected. ", "Some leaders of powerful nations were criticised by their people and the press for either not acting immediately, or adequately, for the calamity hit countries. School children, top celebrities of the cinema and music worlds, sports figures, and heads of government of some countries spared no efforts to stand by the suffering humanity. Many of the Asian countries lagged behind in this regard in contrast to European, and several other nations. ", "Bangladesh was definitely narrowly spared by the tsunami. Had it hit, the destruction could have been of unimaginable proportions. The Kashmir region in Pakistan and India was extensively damaged by severe earthquakes, and now parts of three countries -- Bangladesh, India and Nepal -- are in the grip of floods. The woes of the people in the affected areas naturally know no bounds, and the government, the armed forces, and people of all walks of life throw their weight behind the relief operations, which is no doubt a gigantic task.", "The Kobe conference threw up several effective ideas for disaster prevention, and mitigation of their consequences. The Dhaka conference, and the subsequent 14th conference of the Saarc leaders in New Delhi in April this year, discussed the natural disaster issue as a major area of cooperation among the member states. However, the Saarc must take a new look at the issue of disaster management and related matters in the wake of the current flood situation in South Asia, which has displaced millions apart from killing many. ", "What is more important is the massive task of rehabilitation in the post-flood situation, which is more complicated and difficult. The South Asian countries had earlier reached broad understanding on issues like natural disasters, but experience from the current deluge can certainly provide meaningful input to the quest for combating or mitigating the natural disasters in the region in a concerted manner. They should discuss the issue soon, and not wait for the next summit in Male, or the next meeting of the council of ministers that generally takes place midway between the summits. ", "As the South Asian nations under the banner of the Saarc are sparing no efforts to improve their economic and social condition through collective endeavour, despite occasional strain in the Saarc and the sluggish progress made by the forum, all avenues are being explored for multi-faceted cooperation in various fields. The last summit in New Delhi was quite productive in this direction. But the disaster-prone South Asia must take up the issue of cooperation in this field as a priority. It is just not that disasters bring human tragedies of enormous proportions, but they also badly damage and even, at times, wipe out assiduously built developmental infrastructure. ", "This destruction covers agriculture, road, and other communications, as well as some other vital sectors which are critically important for the welfare and well-being of the people. Such catastrophes obviate progress being made in different fields, and it is imperative that anti-disaster plans be taken up with all seriousness for socio-economic uplift. It also needs modern and external technological and financial support, which should not be lacking since many quarters are keen to assist Saarc for the larger good of the region, particularly when related to the direct interest of the vast multitude living in the most populous region in the world.  ", "Meanwhile, the UN has expressed fears that the flood-hit countries in South Asia may face food shortage and other problems. Saarc should discuss all these issues so that timely and concerted measures can be taken to minimise the consequences.

Though the book originated as her doctoral thesis and is fairly technical in nature, with architectural terms and plans not easily accessible to the layperson, it is on a subject that is inherently interesting to Bangladeshis. How can we not be interested in the mosques around us, not be curious about their origins and history, not wonder about the ideas and environment that shaped them ? What do they reveal about the arrival of Islam in the delta from north India and beyond, about its impact and spread, about our own evolution as a nation and state? Dr. Perween Hasan, by focusing her study on the independent Bengal Sultanate period, has written a study that zeroes in on the formative era of mosque-building in the eastern part of Bengal that is now Bangladesh.", "Below is a conversation The Daily Star had with Dr. Hasan.", " Would you please give us a brief overview of your life, i.e. where you were born, your education, your academic career.", " Born in Kolkata where I started school, my family moved to Dhaka in 1953.  Here I started going to St. Francis Xavier's Convent School (now Green Herald), in Lakshmibazar, and took my 'O'levels from there. I studied English at Dhaka University,  and started  my career as an English teacher in Central Women's and Government Intermediate colleges, before joining the English department at DU in 1969.", "After moving to the USA with my husband and two sons in 1973 , I was admitted into the Ph.D program at Harvard University, from where I earned an MA in Regional Studies, and subsequently a Ph.D in 1984 (Thesis:", ").  Later that year I joined the Department of Islamic History and Culture, Dhaka University as Assistant Professor.  Being also associated with the Women and Gender Studies Department of DU, I offer a course on Women in the Visual Arts, and co-teach a Women and Religion course. Under the Fulbright program, I have been a visiting professor at American universities (Oberlin College, Ohio; University of Southern Maine, Portland). My publications are mostly on the Islamic architecture of Bengal, on aspects of artistic and cultural continuities.", " Could you give our readers an idea what your book is about, the subject matter, your particular approach to it, why the Sultanate period, etc.", " My work is a survey of mosques built during the rule of the Independent Sultans of Bengal (1338-1538). Fifty-five mosques were surveyed (as many as I could find) and each one is reproduced with photographs and floor plans. ", "During the period in question, the frontiers of Bengal were variable, and usually included both East and West Bengal and at times even extended to beyond that. However, I have covered only the geographical limits of the state of Bangladesh, because (a) I felt that the large number of monuments situated here seemed adequate for a single study, and (b) there were practical difficulties involved in carrying out similar extensive fieldwork in India. However, the Indian monuments are discussed whenever relevant.", "The mosque was singled out as a building type because, (a) it is architecturally representative of Islamic culture by its association with collective ritual prayer; (b) of the various types of buildings that must have been part of the architectural landscape from the 14th to the 16th centuries, mosques have survived in the largest number; and (c) buildings with a common function are well-suited for historical investigation, as their architectural features can be readily identified as imported or indigenous. These Sultanate mosques form a homogeneous group of monuments in the area, and contrast sharply with those of the Mughal period that followed.", "My interest in cultural continuities led me to investigate into the origins of these monuments.  They were built in a very regional style that borrowed much of its vocabulary from the thatched huts of Bengal. Always made of brick and decorated with terracotta plaques or sometimes veneered with carved stone, Sultanate architecture clearly formed a continuum with both pre-Islamic Buddhist and post-Sultanate Hindu temples, which were also mostly built of brick. In addition Sultanate mosques also copied the ", "(roof) of the hut. Therefore we see here a style that is rooted in local architectural traditions. The trend was started by Sultan Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah (1415-32), the converted son of Raja Ganesh who was the first Muslim king of native Bengali origin.", "In the Sultanate period, the leaders of Muslim society, although foreigners themselves, were concerned with presenting Islam in an idiom that was within the experience of the common Bengali. Even today, a Muslim who may not be very well versed with the finer points of Islam is emphatic about her/his Islamic identity. Perhaps the cultural identity and psychic mould of today's Bengali Muslim is rooted in the liberal attitudes of the Independent Sultans of Bengal who permitted Bengali culture to flourish and combined it with Islamic influences brought in from the central Islamic lands.", " Reading your book one would get the overall impression that after Bakhtiyar Khilji dispatched Lakshmana Sena in 1204, the basic impulse of the new political authority was towards syncretism, towards accomodation, as expressed in Bengal Sultanate mosque architecture. Yet, this new political dispensation, in order to establish itself, had to uproot the orthodox Hindu ruling Senas. Richard Eaton, in his ", "(a book that you like) writes that the Senas' vision of a Hindu cosmos found expression in their \"monumental royal\" temples. You write in your book that \"the central mihrab (of the Adina Mosque) shows that, although much of the stone was taken from the earlier temples, it was used with a good understanding of how it worked, in contrast to the helter-skelter manner in which plundered material had been used in the early Muslim architecture in both Bengal and elsewhere.\"", "Is it possible to say that, then, there was a period, until, say, 1415, when the Bengali Hindu convert to Islam, Sultan Jalal al-Din Mohammed began his reign, the battle was between the mosque and the temple, and that this history is somewhat ignored amid all the 'syncretic' history-writing of Bengal?", " Have I given the impression that from 1204 the Muslims were benevolently trying to accomodate the culture of the conquered, and every thing was idyllic? Initially there must have been a lot of destruction of temples and edifices of all kinds. Again, that was one of the ways to assert power in those days. ", "But my period of investigation is from the Independent Sultanate that starts from 1338. By this time the Muslims had settled down, a minority ruling over a majority of non-Muslims, and for this to continue for over 200 years, there must have been some spirit of accomodation. According to Eaton (and I agree with him), Sena influence was very much restricted to north and western Bengal; central and eastern Bengal remained beyond their religious and cultural influence. Perhaps this is one reason why conversion (or accommodation) to Islam was easier in central and eastern Bengal, because these areas had never been properly Hinduized. Moreover I think that really monumental stone temples of the scale described in the quote by Eaton could not have been many. Most temples were of modest size. The Buddhist monasteries in Paharpur and Mainamati are truly monumental structures, but they are exceptions and there must have been many small Buddhist temples (a few of their foundations have been excavated by the Dept. of Archaeology) being built simultaneously.", "The weather in Bengal is not favorable to buildings at all, especially those built of brick and mortar. From the first 200 years of Muslim rule only three mosques remain, all in extremely ruined state (including the ones in Tribeni and Adina). We know that there were Muslim traders and settlers in south-east Bengal even before the conquest, yet there is no architectural evidence of their presence. Also, early temples were of brick or wood, rarely of stone, because there is no stone in this delta. Therefore, destruction was, up to a great extent by nature also. ", "Sultanate mosque architecture, on evidence of mosque-building materials alone, cannot be termed as a 'battle' between the temple and the mosque. My whole argument is that both temples and mosques were ultimately derived from the forms of the hut, and Jalaluddin sort of iced the cake by curving the cornice. Rather than syncretic, (which I feel is a very strong word), I would like to call this process 'cultural adaptation, or accomodation' which anyone with long-term plans to stay must do.", " What about the relative size and grandeur of the mosques in West Bengal of this period, and the far more modest stuff here on the eastern side. Is it is a question of form following function, in this case political function? The Bengal Sultanate, in Pandua Gaur and Lakhnawati, uprooted both the Senas and their temples since the latter, like mosques, had a political legitimizing function. The eastern half of Bengal, by contrast, was sparsely populated, with rudimentary communities expanding eastwards through land grants with wet rice cultivation. Here, mosques were built according to community needs, not due to state imperitives. If one therefore studies only the eastern mosques (for whatever reason) isn't it possible to advance the thesis of 'spirit of accomodation' than if one studied the whole? ", " For most of Muslim rule, the main capital of the Muslims was Gaur or Pandua (both in West Bengal). The first building with the curved hut eave (the tomb of Jalaluddin of early 15th century, known as the Eklakhi Tomb) is also situated in Pandua; so the complete Bengal style fashioned after the hut originates in West Bengal. The eastern part of Bengal was settled after the north and west and it was only during the Independent Sultanate that most of it was brought under Muslim purview. The point is that after the Eklakhi, all mosques, tombs, as well as gateways (at least from the evidence that we have), both in East and West Bengal were made in the Bengal style.", "There are some very large mosques in East Bengal too: the mosques at Mahasthan (on a Buddhist site of a much earlier date, but where a Hindu temple could have existed during the time of the conquest), Shaitgumbad, Shatgachhia, Bagha, Kusumba, Pathrail. Four of the mosques that I have included have platforms on a mezzanine level which were reserved for the king, governor, or other very high official, so these were not all small, single-domed mosques, although the majority were; several were medium sized with several domes. Although I have not done a survey, from what I have seen, I would suspect that even in W. Bengal the majority of the mosques would turn out to be small or medium-sized with single domes. I have argued that whether large or small, it is the square, single-domed unit that became the basic component of all mosques. These units were simply multiplied when a larger space was needed, perhaps for the needs of a larger community but most often to express the power of the builder. The Adina mosque expresses only the power of Sikandar Shah, who had just repulsed an attempt by Sultan Firuz Shah Tughluq of Delhi to take back Bengal, so he does not hesitate to call himself khalifa and express his affiliation to Arabia and Persia, not mentioning either Bengal or India. There are several such mosques in W. Bengal. ", "Again, there are more monuments, some with more elaborate decoration that survive in West Bengal than in the east. This is not only because the capitals were there but because of the relatively drier climate. Also Buddhist manuscripts as well as Buddhist/Hindu sculptures recovered from E. Bengal indicate that there were some well-known sites with temples even in the east (though perhaps not as many as in the west). So there must have been a period of destruction in both east and west. To come to any kind of overall conclusion, there must be a similar survey of the monuments of W. Bengal, just as this one is for the east. Until then I don't think we have enough evidence to make a judgment.", " There is talk presently about how multi-storied madrassah construction is ruining the 'setting' of these Sultanate mosques, making them look ugly. Can we possibly posit two differing creeds at loggerheads here: one the westernized, educated middle class impulse that values historical conservation (and thereby perhaps a certain reification), and the other that sees a mosque as a living organic being, which traditionally has not been a single unit but a complex of masjid, madrassahs and khanqas? How do you see it? ", " These old mosques had been left alone in their settings for all these years. The orphanages and madrassahs are very recent phenomena, and they have taken over the ancient monuments with no regard to their value as antiquities. They have bored holes through their terracotta plaqued walls so that RCC pipes can be inserted on which shamianas are hung during Friday prayers. The old mosques have always been used for prayer and no one ever objected to that. But they were not vandalized like this. Is there a shortage of mosques anywhere?  There are several mosques in the same neighborhood which can accommodate many more jamaats, why does the old one have to be sacrificed? If this goes on, nothing of historic value will be left.  Instead of taking over the few heritage sites that we have, we could educate our people to respect and look after them even while they are used, as they have been for so many centuries.", "It is quite evident that an extensive, and arduous, fieldwork undergirds your book. Is there any memorable experience from those days that you would share with us, a lasting impression that you have with you?", "I have plenty of memorable anecdotes from my fieldwork, but let me just say that I was amazed at the kindness and hospitality that we received in the villages when we traveled.

Probably, the Left felt that it would not be convincing if it were to do so after having dotted i's and crossed t's in more or less all the decisions that Manmohan Singh government took in the past three and a half years. Till now, the Left, particularly the CPI (M), has been having vicarious satisfaction of governing, sorting out names for India's president and appointing the vice-president.", "Even today, the Left could have created a rumpus over the increase in the number of poor in the country. It could have taken the government to task on the data revealed by its appointed commission on the Unorganised Sector. The report says that 836 millions, 87 percent of India's population, live on Rs 20 (half a dollar) or less per person per day.", "For reasons best known to the Left, it chose the nuclear deal. Politically, it misfired. One, the Left found itself on the side of the BJP. Two, a few hours before the Left rejected the deal, China had threatened that \"either the Indo-US nuclear deal will fall or the Manmohan Singh government.\" Was there any telepathy? ", "If any country, leave America apart, had made the observation which China did, the Left and its camp followers would have been up in arms. The remark would have been considered interference in India's domestic affairs. Yet, there was not even a whimper in the Left quarters, much less criticism. They felt important by giving repeated statements on how India's sovereignty would be circumscribed if the deal went through.  Little did they realise that sovereignty rested with the people in a country. It was from within, not without. How could America or, for that matter, any other country take away, whatever the wording of the deal, our sovereignty?", "India became sovereign after untold sacrifices. The nation knows how to defend itself against the different challenges. In their shoddy wrangling, the political parties should not drag in sovereignty, which is something sacred. All American laws, including the Hyde Act, put together cannot enslave us. Nor can Washington's warnings deter us from doing what we want to do. The Left should judge the government on the basis of the steps it takes to implement the prime minister's statement in parliament in July 2005.", "We stand by \"no-first use,\" the undertaking given by BJP prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee. He even announced a moratorium on nuclear tests. The BJP's turnabout, like that of the Left, is political. It has nothing to do with our sovereignty. The Left's animus against America is understandable, but what is the BJP's problem? The latter initiated the whole thing following the unending talks between BJP foreign minister Jaswant Singh and America's I. Talbot, a top functionary in the Clinton government.", "The point of concern is not the deal but the manner in which New Delhi is watering down its independent foreign policy, which had come to be known as non-alignment. We, as a nation, lessen ourselves when the US ambassador in New Delhi warns us not to vote against America on the issue of Iran, and we obediently do so. We, too, do not want Iran to have the bomb, and we should support all steps to stop it from developing one. ", "But what is disconcerting is the general perception that America is dictating us. In the renewal of the cold war atmosphere, New Delhi has to play a role, the independent one that we played when the world was divided into two hostile blocs. How to win back the confidence of small and weak countries is what New Delhi should be thinking, instead of demolishing the consensus on foreign policy we have been having.  I am personally against the entire nuclear programme, starting with the bomb. Both Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru were against making the bomb. I am not sure whether we should have nuclear energy.", "Nuclear power houses will be a big hazard. Any leakage, as happened in Europe and Russia, can kill thousands of people. I do not know whether nuclear energy will turn out to be cheaper than the thermal or the hydro one. Billions of dollars need to be invested in nuclear energy. And all this will be in the public sector. We should have concentrated on harnessing water, including the Brahmaputra, with the help of Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. It would have benefited us all economically.", "However, the Manmohan Singh government's mind is made up on nuclear energy. In a country like India, where the marginal group consuming less than Rs 15 per person has increased from 290 million to as high as 392 million, nearly 40 percent of population, the priority should have been livelihood, not energy, however important it is for development. The same question arises again: Development for whom? ", "The political fallout of the nuclear deal is what seems to worry the Congress-led government. Some sort of mechanism has been established to allay the Left's fear. But the confidence between the two has been shaken. The Left also feels that support to the Congress and its policies has eroded its base. This is true. Yet, it looks as if the present crisis over the Indo-US nuclear deal will blow over. The Left is beginning to realise that it would lose heavily if the polls were to take place immediately. Still, as things look today, it is only a matter of time when the distance between the two would become unbridgeable.", "A mid-term poll may become unavoidable because even if the government is not pulled down, its credibility would lessen if it is reduced to a minority in the Lok Sabha. The Congress, without majority in the House, can rule as Narasimha Rao did for full five years. The president, who is the Congress nominee, will come in handy. But that does not solve the problem. The minority does not become a majority.", "Already moves are afoot to cobble together an alternative. The BJP-headed NDA is willing to extend support to any group that can show how it can reach the magic figure of 273 in the 545-member Lok Sabha.  The third combination (United National Progressive Alliance) is all for ousting the Congress-led coalition at the Centre. Again, its problem is that it cannot have a majority. ", "However uncertain the future scenario, the bottom line is that no political party wants a mid-term poll. The Left has said that it will oppose the government without being a party to the toppling move. There is more heat than substance.

{"reporter": "Md Zafar Sadeque", "headline": ["Overcoming problems in agriculture", "Opinion"], "lastModified": null, "newsBody": ["It is undeniable that Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in agriculture specially in cereal production in post independent era. Population of Bangladesh was 75 million just after the liberation and production of food was 10 million tons with a deficit of 3 million tons. Nowadays the population is double touching the tune of 150 million and food production is about 30 million tons. Apparently there is no deficiency. It is a great achievement! The half-fed farmers can claim the lion's share of this success. But beside the successes there are some identified and conventional problems in the agriculture sector of Bangladesh. Some new and strategic problems in agriculture are emerging parallely alongside the conventional and century old ones. It is a matter of regret that these new problem fail to attract the attention of the policy makers.", "Use of appropriate technology can play an excellent role in the extension of agriculture in Bangladesh. Use of drum-seeder is gaining popularity as an appropriate technology in different countries including Vietnam. Drum-seeder was first innovated at the International Rice Research Institute in Manila, the capital of the Philippines. Production of rice has increased enormously in Vietnam using drum-seeder successfully. There is a huge potentiality of producing more rice in Bangladesh too using drum-seeder. Production of rice in Bangladesh can at least be increased by 2.5-3 million tons valued at Taka 20,000 million if successful use of drum-seeder is ensured keeping other factors unchanged. Again Taka 20,000 million can be fetched by saving Taka 2000 per hectare. ", "Thus Bangladesh can accrue Taka 40,000 million yearly from internal source ensuring use of drum-seeder. For this, all the rice farming of Bangladesh should be brought under drum-seeder cultivation at the earliest possible time. At the same time use of urea can be controlled by using leaf-colour-chart and gooti urea. Then demand of urea could be met by the production of the urea factories of the country. There will be no need of importing urea from abroad rather it could be exported to some extent.", "It is customary that transplanted Aman season is considered as the main rice producing season of Bangladesh. But it is being noticed in the last few years that Boro season is turning into the main rice producing season. Transplanted Aman season is stepping down to 2nd rice producing season. But this Boro occupying the main season defeating Aman is rather deadly. Priority for Boro is because of the corresponding shrinkage of land under pulses, oilseeds, wheat and winter vegetable. Attention should be given for increasing the land under cultivation of pulses, oilseeds, wheat and winter vegetable for more production by stopping this terrible trend. Transplanted Aman season should be reinstated to its main position. Transplanted Aman is more or less rain-fed and there is no need of supplementary irrigation.", "Gradually decreasing cultivable land is yet another burning problem for agriculture in Bangladesh. 212 hectare land per day or 77,380 hectare per year is being lost which is approximately 1 percent of the total cultivable land in Bangladesh. All the cultivable land will be lost by the year 2092 at this rate. Appropriate measure should be taken at once for not losing any further patch of cultivable land. Steps should be taken to construct multi-storied houses in the villages too. Perhaps there is no alternative to multi-storied houses in the villages, though it may not apparently seem realistic in the background of the prevailing socio-economic condition of rural Bangladesh. Experts calculate that 1.2 million hectare three-crop cultivable land can be recovered by constructing multi-storied houses in the villages.", "Poverty reduction is yet another incarnate problem of Bangladesh. To speak the truth, agricultural development and poverty reduction are supplementary to one another. Permanent poverty reduction is indeed possible by distributing all the khas land, land recovered through constructing multi-storied houses in the villages and land recovered through implementing land ceiling of Bangabandhu. By these measures poverty reduction will attain 100 percent success in the year 2008 instead of 50 percent target of the Millennium Development Goal (by the year  2015) as stated in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Food security can be ensured by eradicating poverty for good.", "Another problem may emerge due to the increasing production of rice in 2 to 3 years. Total production is likely to surpass the requirement due to the increasing use of hybrid seeds. Then there will be a crisis of storage facilities and packaging gunny bags. Policy makers should be cautious about this ensuing problem right now.", "Flood is another yearly problem. Bangladesh must suffer the havoc due to its geo-physical position and flowing of three great rivers over its territory. So in Bangladesh development plans should not be made on the concept of \"flood control\" rather the concept of \"controlled flood\" should be given preference in implementing future infrastructural development plans. Due to the \"controlled flood\" 2500 million tons of silt may be deposited evenly on the cultivable land all over Bangladesh which will play an important role in increasing food production.", "It is noteworthy to mention about the recent and amazing development of agriculture in the Indian state of West Bengal. During the period of 1980's West Bengal was one of the backward states of India. Situation started changing after taking necessary radical land reform and agricultural development by the left front government. Political stability returned to the state and wind of development started blowing in economic arena. Due to this the left front government in West Bengal is passing its glorious 30 years in power. West Bengal now is one of the advanced states of India. The radical land reform and agricultural development could be an ideal model for Bangladesh too.", "It is a matter of regret that even after 36 years of independence, the country has no mention worthy agriculture policy though Bangladesh is dependent on agriculture. During the Awami League government a very simple 35-page agriculture policy was adopted which too has never been followed in its true sense. Bangladesh needs a comprehensive agriculture policy.", "For ensuring the food security in the coming days for the ever increasing population the policy makers should pay attention to the emerging problems in agriculture. If agriculture in Bangladesh is made dynamic by following a comprehensive agriculture policy, the dream of a prosperous nation will come true by the year 2021 when it will celebrate its golden jubilee of independence."], "tag": ["Editorial"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=1357", "location": null, "date": "2007-08-25"}

Huge swathes of our territory, as well as that of neighbouring India have been subjected to inundation, flood-related damage and loss of lives. This time round, the process has peaked once towards the end of the second week of August, receded slightly and then again gained strength because of renewed heavy rainfall in Nepal. It has not only devastated standing crops but also existing infrastructure related to communications, education, healthcare and the rural economy. ", "Bangladesh and its citizens are used to floods and to coping with such natural disasters. We have over time also realised that the level of our vulnerability increases in the post-monsoon period when seasonal reversals of wind direction caused by temperature differences between the land and the sea can dump enormous quantities of water from the sky. ", "We have with resilience and patience also proved that we are able to regenerate after the country has been subjected to severe flooding (as happened in 1988 and in 1998). ", "This time as well, all concerned are trying their best to salvage a situation that has been triggered by heavy monsoon rainfall not only in Nepal (worst in the last 40 years) but also in the upper reaches of the foothills of the Himalayas both in the northwestern (Himachal Pradesh and the United Provinces in India) and northeastern flanks of Bangladesh (bordering Bhutan and Assam in India). It has caused hardship and affected over 15 million people in Bangladesh alone. The death toll has reached nearly 600. Rural housing has been particularly damaged and meagre savings in terms of livestock and poultry washed away by the swirling waters. Crops worth nearly Taka 2,000 crore have also been lost. ", "It has been interesting watching the government gradually evolve its position with regard to the disaster. In the beginning there was hesitation in declaring the flood as a national disaster. Relief efforts and temporary rehabilitation was undertaken, but at every turn, it was stressed that the interim Administration was not willing to 'politicise the flood' and use it to seek necessary foreign assistance. It was also stressed that people could support the providing of relief without identifying such efforts under political banners. Such an approach, for obvious reasons, caused debate. Some pointed out at that time that the government was being naive. ", "Well, a few weeks later, the government has finally  acknowledged that the matter is more serious than what was anticipated. They have now decided to ask the donor community for US dollar 150 million in budgetary support and flood aid. Ostensibly, such a sum will be critical for meeting the post-flood situation. ", "The floodwaters might be receding slowly, but as explained by Bahatun, a flood-hit old woman from Hazaribagh, hunger is on the rise. This is something that is clearly staring us in the face. To this has been added the acute shortage of pure drinking water. This in turn has led to severe presence of water-borne diseases. Critical need has surfaced for shelter, food and medical help including IV saline. Electronic media have informed that, on an average, more than 35 diarrhea patients are crowding into Dhaka hospitals every hour. I can only imagine the seriousness given the fact that 47 districts out of 64 have faced varying degrees of inundation. Hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons have also sought temporary shelter in relatively urban areas. ", "One of the biggest casualties has been education, with almost all the educational institutions turned into relief camps and schooling being suspended for nearly one month. Repair of damaged infrastructure will take quite some time. Meanwhile, for all practical purposes, students at large in the flood-affected areas will be falling behind others in the non-flooded zones. ", "This time round, misunderstandings and communication gaps between the relevant government  authorities and civil society and political parties have led to the latter taking a back seat and playing a less than enthusiastic role. The government must not allow this situation to continue. It has to visibly demonstrate the inclusiveness of other stakeholders. One way out might be to ask civil society representatives to be part of government post flood rehabilitation teams. It should  not be overlooked that NGOs, because of the nature of their functions always maintain a strong database and links to local community leaderships. Political party networks should also be encouraged to participate in relief operations along with the armed forces (who traditionally have better logistical support). The government needs to make it clear that emergency is no bar to participation in relief operations, even by political activists at the grassroots level.", "We have many challenges ahead of us. I am however confident that we will be able to overcome them through discussion and inter-active practical engagement. We need to restore normalcy in governance as soon as possible and practicable. We have a fixed time frame with regard to the electoral agenda. Effective addressing of this will require functional and meaningful resolution of the post-flood travails. It is one thing to say that correction of electoral rolls and preparation of ID cards will continue without interruption. That will however be difficult if the post-flood short-term and immediate rehabilitation is not completed by end of October at the latest (despite the many holidays associated with Ramzan and Eid-ul-Fitr).", "I am expressing this anxiety because government officials have to be free at the lowest administrative levels to carry out their expected functions pertaining to the preparatory steps associated with the holding of a fair and credible parliamentary election.", "This will be the only way forward in our ongoing effort towards eventual poverty reduction within our development agenda paradigm. This will have to include direct intervention by the government in providing credit extension support to the flood affected farmers and micro entrepreneurs whose crops, livestock and seedbeds have been destroyed either by water or sand brought in by flood waters. In this context, an efficient food grain distribution system will have to be set up as a supporting mechanism till the next harvest comes home. Without this measure, we will have a huge movement of population to urban areas from affected rural hinterland. The damaged transportation networks, both roads and railways, will also have to be repaired.", "Natural calamities always have a bright side. They provide the general population with opportunities for unity. We should try to find least common denominators irrespective of professional background and political persuasion and join hands to mitigate the sufferings of the distressed. It would also be pertinent for the business community to shoulder part of this responsibility by trying to contain profiteering and hoarding that has been the bane of our consumers in the recent past.", "We as a people have courage and fortitude and must again demonstrate to the wider international community that Bangladesh can face natural disasters and quickly return to business as usual.

{"reporter": "Monzurul Huq", "headline": ["Japanese PM's Kolkata connection", "Closeup Japan"], "lastModified": null, "newsBody": ["AS this piece reaches the readers, I presume that the prime minister of Japan will still be in India, on the second stage of his three-nation Asia tour. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe left Tokyo this Sunday on a week-long tour that will take him to Indonesia, India and Malaysia. This will be his first official visit to India since he assumed office last September. In India, he will meet his counterpart, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, and will also give a policy speech in the parliament, in which he plans to call for stronger bilateral cooperation between the two major economies.", "At his scheduled meeting with the Indian prime minister, the Japanese leader is expected to seek cooperation from the country that has recently become not only a powerhouse in global economy, but also one of the largest greenhouse gas emitting states, on his \"Cool Earth 50\" initiative aimed at halving global emissions by 2050. Mr. Abe had earlier outlined this goal as a step towards creating a new framework agreement that would succeed the Kyoto Protocol which expires in 2012. ", "The two countries are also to conclude a currency swap agreement to help counter investor speculation in their respective currencies. Since a stable currency is a key to any country's continued economic growth, the agreement will help India as it tries to attract foreign investors. A stable rupee will also be advantageous to Japan as the pace of Japanese investment in India is accelerating. In 2006, for example, Japan's direct investment in India doubled from the previous year to about 60 billion yen.", "All this sounds pretty attractive and beyond any controversy. As a result, there should not be any doubt about anything going wrong during this very important visit for both the countries, as Japan too is keen on forging a closer relationship with the emerging Asian giant. But the itinerary of the Japanese prime minister includes a less significant meeting far from the Indian capital New Delhi, at the very end of his visit. That gives a small hint that something controversial might be cooking up at the back. Abe is to make a brief stopover in Kolkata, just next door to Bangladesh, to meet a person he considers very important to his heart. ", "To understand the depth of this importance, we have to look back briefly at one particular episode in Japan's recent past, that the Dutch scholar Ian Buruma described beautifully in his book, \"Inventing Japan,\" in the following words: \"On Christmas Eve 1948, a thin middle-age man in a shabby khaki uniform and a peaked cap was released from Sugamo prison. His soft lips formed a toothy smile as he boarded an American jeep. ", "Kishi Nobusuke had just spent three years in Sugamo jail as a Class A war crimes suspect. He had been General Tojo's minister of commerce and industry when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. Before that, he had been the industrial czar of Manchukuo. He was, in fact, the nearest Japanese equivalent to Albert Speer. His wartime responsibilities ranged from munitions to slave labour. If the war had been fought by soldiers, their conquests had been administered by people like him\" (Inventing Japan, page 155).", "It should be mentioned that just a couple of days before, on December 22, 1948, seven of the Japanese defendants at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal, including Tojo, were hanged at the same Sugamo prison after a simple meal of cold rice and sake. Kishi was lucky enough as the changing times changed the heart of the occupation authorities, which eventually paved the way for him to make a soft landing again at the helm of power straight from the prison. And he is the grandfather of the present Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, whose vision of a beautiful Japan doesn't differ much from the grand old man he definitely admires.", "It has been reported in the Japanese press that the prime minister of Japan is making his trip to Kolkata to pay a courtesy call on the son of one of the judges of the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal, who found none of the defendants guilty on any count and who, in his long dissenting judgment, acquitted the defendants of all the charges brought against them. ", "Judge Radhabinod Pal, the Indian judge in the tribunal, was probably the most well versed in international law among all the eleven judges. He was also a scholar of international repute who had been highly admired in India. Moreover, none of his speeches and writings gives any clear indication of any politically biased inclination that might have influenced him indirectly to come to such a controversial conclusion. As a result, one wonders what prompted him to decide that what General Tojo and his followers did in Manchuria, Nanjing and many other places did not merit to be called war crimes, because those who were judging them did the same in other places they conquered and ruled.", "Judge Pal was obviously in need of strong evidence and examples to prove what he said in his dissenting judgment, and he tried to present all such arguments in a lengthy written form that might have taken up much of his time in Tokyo. Writing a judgment covering almost 1,200 pages no doubt requires time and energy, and Judge Pal did not hesitate to give time for that purpose, most likely at the expense of the court proceedings that judges are not supposed to skip. ", "American Scholar John Dower, in his acclaimed account of post World War II Japan, \"Embracing Defeat,\" gives us a hint that Judge Pal probably knew how he intended to vote before being seated at the tribunal. For, Dower reminds us, Judges Pal and Webb were notably absent from portions of the proceedings (Embracing Defeat, page 465). So, there is a possibility that the Indian judge might have taken up the seat with a preconceived judgment, a highly controversial position that runs contrary to what a free and fair trial is supposed to be.", "But for those who in Japan tend to look at the country's wartime history with a feeling of nostalgia and humiliation, Judge Pal had immediately become a hero, and the worship of such a hero has long been shifted to its right place -- the controversial Yasukuni shrine that, from time to time, fans the feeling of distrust and suspicion among Japan's neighbours. The Yasukuni shrine has a museum adjacent to it that largely displays items related to Japan's past wars. Until a few years ago, it also displayed a large portrait of Judge Pal, which was replaced recently by a life-size bust. Skeptics in Japan say that since the museum cannot show any portrait or bust of Tojo publicly, therefore, Judge Pal represents sort of a proxy for Japan's war-time leader, as he had acquitted him of all the charges of war crimes.", "As a result, Abe's visit to Kolkata to pay respect to the deceased Indian judge of the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal is seen by many in Japan, and probably also in neighbouring countries, as a sort of a proxy visit to Yasukuni shrine at a time when he refrains from going there personally just to appease the neighbours."], "tag": ["Editorial"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=1254", "location": null, "date": "2007-08-24"}

Once again it was evident last Monday when a small incident magnified to rock the country. A brawl at a soccer game between students and army men turned our streets into battlefields. Human follies is what we should blame for it. If anything it reminds me of a myth. It reminds me of the Achilles' Heel.", "For the sake of those who may not remember it: When Achilles, a Greek hero, was an infant, his mother had dipped him in the river Styx, holding onto him by his heel. She had done it to make her son invulnerable where the waters touched him, which excluded areas covered by her thumb and forefinger. In the Trojan war, Achilles died when Paris fired a poisoned arrow and hit that spot in his heel.", "Ever since then the phrase ''Achilles' Heel'' has been used as an expression for a fatal weakness in spite of overall strength, which can lead one to downfall. Those who started it and those who couldn't preempt its spread, failed to realize that one small incident could have such widespread ramifications and turn into a  showdown against this government. It looked as if all the educational institutions in the country were soaked in kerosene. One spark of discontent ignited a fire that is still burning.", "It is possible that the politicians have fanned the fire to keep it going. In his address to the nation Wednesday night, the chief adviser blamed the violence on the \"evil forces.\" He has also assured us that the government was forced to impose curfew to protect the lives and property of people. He further said that the curfew was a temporary step and would be withdrawn as soon as the situation improved.", "That is one of the many ways the whole thing could turn out. But one of the concerns is whether this should be seen as a sign of defiance. Has the violence on the streets and campuses made a crack on the fortified walls of the Emergency Rule? Has it jarred loose the grip of the semi-civilian government which had come to power with ironclad popularity? ", "Perhaps some or all of those in the government will bury their heads in the sand and like to think that nobody is watching. But the fact remains that the government should have avoided this confrontation. ", "To the extent that quick decision was taken to remove the army camp, and that the government itself, in effect, apologised to the students, it should have calmed the situation. But it was the police brutality of the first night that angered the students so.", "Students are a difficult ballgame and no matter how much we want to ban their politics, politics infiltrates homes through them when families see the world through the eyes of their children.", "The most alarming part is that even if student politics can be crushed, it has the uncanny power to rise from its ashes. In 1968 two rival groups of students fought each other in Mexico City and the government responded by sending riot police next day to stop the accompanying vandalism and to arrest the perpetrators. These policemen attacked the students so ferociously that it led to countrywide protests, which engendered an unending cycle of university-state conflict leading to the Tlatelolco massacre. For the next 30 years, the fallout of this massacre reverberated through the Mexican society and shook it in its foundation. ", "The Mexican movement revealed the system for what it was: authoritarian, sometimes brutal, and primarily interested in making the rich richer. Previously immune from governmental violence, the upper and middle classes learned through their children that they would be attacked if they questioned the system too closely. Scholars, both domestic and foreign, began criticising the system and calling for democratic reform.  In 1997, the ruling party lost control of the lower house of Congress, the Mexico City government, and the governorships of several states. ", "The history is not to scare the government which has no intention to spend three decades in power. Yet the ultimate concern is that student revolts seldom die down and almost always lead to wider and deep-running conflicts. This is where the events of last few days leading to indefinite curfew in six divisional headquarters should ring a bell. ", "It is not exactly clear how the volatile situation is going to be resolved. A few days of curfew, expulsion of students from their dorms, closing of campuses are temporary solutions, and, if past is any experience, these measures are of limited value unless the real issues are addressed.. For last seven months, the political parties were looking for a lifeline and the government will throw that lifeline into their lap if it fails to tackle the present situation wisely.", "The Wednesday night speech of the chief adviser did not tell us how that is going to be done. If the police becomes more repressive and the army is used to quell the resistance, something which also took place in the Mexican experience, it is likely to push the politicians and people towards the students. Compounded with its failure to control prices and law and order, the overwhelming popularity of the government may continue to erode.", "On the other hand, if the government decides to back out, it will expose its weakness. It will embolden the students and the politicians to further undermine its authority. In short, the tiny incident at a soccer field has discomfited the government. If it gets embroiled in this crisis, the reforms of political parties, crusade against corruption and holding of election by the end of next year will be disrupted. ", "One option could be that the government will try to have an honest dialogue with the students and avoid further conflicts. But the students must also realise that widespread vandalism that accompanied their agitation is totally unacceptable and has greatly damaged their acceptability.

{"reporter": "Muhammad Nurul Huda", "headline": ["Abuse of authority and the invitational edge", "Straight line"], "lastModified": null, "newsBody": ["GIVEN the fact that the police have discretionary authority to institute proceedings that the population finds inconvenient or costly, there are obviously many opportunities for officers to abuse their discretion by accepting or demanding bribes to \"turn a blind eye.\" Thus, in many societies citizens are expected to offer bribes to avoid tickets for traffic violations, or to speed up the processing of some administrative task for which the police are responsible.", "The above rarely occurs in isolation: in such countries government officials commonly also demand bribes. The reason is usually pretty clear: it is that impoverished governments are unable adequately to remunerate their officials, and bribery, though illegal, is accepted as one of the means by which officials, including police officers, enhance their salary.", "The notion of the \"invitational edge\" is useful because it draws our attention to how policing itself is structurally conducive to illegality and breaches of rules. The implication of this being that anyone placed in the position of a police officer would be similarly tempted. This is a conclusion that undermines easy condemnation and adopts what some criminologists have called an \"appreciative\" stance towards other forms of deviancy.", "There are many who would like to argue by saying that policing allows officers to become corrupt. Such a statement would not amount to much because many occupations do so, from small shop-keeping to being executives of multi-national companies. However, policing invites deviancy and that invitation, in undercover operations, is extended by those with a vested interest in subverting the enforcement of the law -- namely the participants in the illicit activity. They actively seek to ensnare officers in a web of mutual dependence and reciprocity that compromises the integrity of the police and, thus, safeguards their business interests.", "Much more common, indeed endemic, is the breaking of the rules that supposedly govern police behaviour. Police officers take actions strictly forbidden by law, such as stopping and searching someone without the necessary grounds for suspicion. Equally, procedures designed to safeguard the rights of suspects and other vulnerable people might be ignored or circumvented. Improper bargains are sometimes struck with some suspects.", "Policing is a thoroughly bureaucratized activity governed by voluminous rules and procedures that stipulate in great detail what the police should do in any situation. However, \"invitational edges of corruption\" enables us to see that these rules, far from being part of the solution, are often actually a principal cause of the problem.", "Police organisations epitomise bureaucracy: they attempt to orchestrate the behaviour of officers through a dense set of rules and procedures. Police officers, like personnel in other bureaucracies, suffer the frustrations that any such organisation produces. The response of officers to these frustrations is to circumvent or subvert the formal rules, just as their counterparts do in other bureaucracies. However, police organisations belong to a distinctive sub-set of bureaucracy, that is they are \"punishment-centred.\"", "It is important to recognise that the above rules are almost purely negative in their effect: that is, police officers may be disciplined, prosecuted, or otherwise put into difficulties if they are seen to break the rules, but they will not necessarily be praised, or enjoy their work, or achieve their career objectives if they keep to them.", "The \"punishment-centered bureaucracy\" of police organisations arises from the \"invisible\" exercise of discretionary authority that leaves senior officers unable to effectively command their subordinates. The history of policing has been characterised by the attempts of senior officers to extend effective control over their subordinates. The threat of penalties for transgressions is one of the few available means of achieving this and, so, formal rules mushroom as particular problems surface from the depths of invisibility that surrounds most police work.", "The \"punishment-centered\" style has consequences that can bring officers to the \"invitational edges of corruption.\" The formal rules of the organisation are regarded with almost complete contempt and, perhaps, good reason. An incompetent, ineffective, and injudicious officer could remain in good standing in his department provided it cannot be shown by any accepted method of proof that he has violated some expressly formulated norm of conduct. This comes very close to saying that an officer who shows up for work, does what he is told to do and no more, and stays out of trouble, meets the criterion of adequacy demanded of him. \"Real\" police officers do more, and in so doing risk violating \"inhibitory\" and \"presentational\" rules. ", "A significant implication of \"punishment-centred bureaucracy\" is that it obliges senior officers to be hypocritical. They are aware that subordinates cannot police \"according to the book,\" but they are obliged to maintain the fiction that policing is rule-governed. This creates the contradiction that police organizations are both \"punishment-centered bureaucracies\" and also notoriously indulgent; for senior officers and middle-ranking supervisors often give the \"nod and a wink\" to their subordinates, especially if the latter are achieving \"results.\"", "We know that discretion is an unavoidable corollary of policing: full enforcement of the law is impossible, and to attempt it would be undesirable. Laws, however specific they might appear, are universal precepts that must be applied to very specific circumstances. We also know that the use of discretion necessarily relegates legality to a secondary status, for the law is used selectively to enforce prevailing notions of respectability.", "We also know that policing in modern liberal democracies involves the police living a lie: they pretend that they are mere servants of the law, whereas their daily experience is that they are, if anything, its master -- employing the law as and when necessary to achieve their discretionary goals. This is a situation calculated to encourage cynicism, for the ideals are not just unattainable they are actually inappropriate -- to enforce the law blindly would be to perpetrate massive injustice.", "Policing is a scandal-prone occupation, not simply because the opportunities for illicit conduct exist, for they exist in almost any occupation. Temptation is more active than that: policing places officers repeatedly at the \"invitational edge of corruption,\" where exactly the same actions may be taken with proper or improper motives. ", "The reason for the above reality is that the police operate in a nether world just beyond the limits of respectability. In the fulfillment of their duties officers lie, deceive, conspire to allow illegal activities to continue, and use force. Yet, this can never be acknowledged, for the legitimacy of police authority in liberal democracy rests upon the myth that they impartially enforce the law according to \"the book.\"", "In situations as above, officers are repeatedly tempted to secure their purposes, which are often the same as those of the police organization itself, by exploiting the latitude that their role affords them. This might involve the accepting of bribes from, and performing corrupt services for, those with whom they are invited to establish close rapport. Often, officers have to ensure that those they believe to be guilty are convicted, or use excessive force against those who challenge or threaten them.", "In societies where there is a large and threatening underclass, police misconduct is endemic. In more developed societies, especially where notions of universal citizenship are firmly established, it is more restrained, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Yet, the public in many societies tacitly conspire in police illegality, provided it is targeted at excluded groups and does not erupt into a public scandal."], "tag": ["Editorial"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=1252", "location": null, "date": "2007-08-24"}

This happened despite press identity being strapped in bold letters across the bonnets of transports and the journalists themselves showing their identity cards on demand. Some journalists despite revealing their identity, were even detained in police stations before being let off at late hours.

It is, therefore, imperative that the curfew in force be lifted at the earliest. The duration of the curfew must be as limited in nature as possible, indeed should be curtailed in order for normal life to resume.", "Such drastic steps, while they may become necessary in extraordinary circumstances, have a bad effect on livelihood. Those who lead lives as daily wage earners, such as rickshaw pullers and scooter drivers, find themselves in a straitjacket when a curfew or similar restrictive measure is in force. There is too the question of how countless numbers of people are deprived of medical treatment because of a shutdown of drugs shops during a curfew. The supply of daily necessities is also important.

With scenes of unmitigated violence in such places as Mirpur, Satmasjid Road and other places repeatedly shown on the television channels, it became clear that vandalism had been let loose and strong steps needed to be put in place to roll back the violence. The imposition of a curfew, from such a perspective, is therefore understandable. And yet let us note once more that thoughts should be given to its lifting at the earliest in order for people to go about their daily business.", "There is today a paramount need for peace and normal conditions to be restored in the country.

They will make sure that the recent flood victims have been rehabilitated quickly with whatever resources in hand without giving any opportunity to pilfer relief goods and money as was witnessed during the political regimes. The devastating flood  put extra burden of stress and strain on the nation.  With the current volatile world in both political and economic terms, this is by all means, a worst of times for all the nations rich and poor alike.  Certainly, the recent flood inflicted a major blow to this nation in the present global environment.  ", "We know, immediately after January 11 there came a great relief.  Except the corrupt politicians and some officials of the Khaleda-Nizami regime, everyone, from a day-labourer to the president, was relieved.  The day-labourer hoped that finally the price of essentials will come down after getting rid of the clutches of business syndicates from the market.  The president was relieved since he finally saw a window opened through which he would be in a position to exercise his constitutional role without fear.", "Unfortunately, the honeymoon did not last long.  The dreams of the day-labourer never come true.  The prices of essentials let alone reducing, have been rising unabated over the last seven months. Now, the flood has made it an impossible task to do anything better until a normal year returns.  The nation has to wait for another good harvest after the present cycle of floods. I am sure the international community knows this very well. ", "How is the honourable president doing?  It is impossible to tell.  Unfortunately, he made the position controversial before the weeks and days of January 11 that it is not clear how serious he was then in exercising president's authority.  Apparently, he seems relieved and is enjoying the life at Bangabhaban by keeping arms length distance from his former political masters. ", "However, this cannot be said by seeing the faces of the CA and his rest of the advisers.  Of course, the recent flood has made their positions and roles even harder. We argued in this forum in the past that it is humanly impossible for eleven people to manage more than fifty departments for such a long period of time.  It is now clear that the constitution becomes a hurdle in increasing the number of advisors.  One wonders: which come first, the constitution or the nation?  A layman could ask, is not a smooth running of the nation also a constitutional priority?  Certainly, the advisers' life would have been less stressful if they were given the chance of co-opting few more members in the cabinet.", "Some, however, argue that the CA must be enjoying his job since he has the rare opportunity to serve this impoverished land with a status of a PM.  He would not have got this opportunity if 1/11 had not taken place.  While this is true, one can also provide a counter argument that the CA has been doing this out of his love for the nation having no monetary gains what so ever unlike his politician predecessors.  Let's  not forget that the major mission of the CA and his cohort with the support of the joint forces is to bring back the order in our morally crumbled society.  ", "It is now clear that all the political governments in the past had two missions in mind:  love for power and love for money.  Some, however, strongly argue that they do politics nothing but love for the people.  Unfortunately, this does not buy anymore.  With the recent events surrounding tax dodging by both the immediate past PM and her right hand man for the last 20 years, it is now clear like crystal that they did not love the nation and they did not love the people unlike their political icon (Ziaur Rahman in mind).  Once again, Professor Yunus is proven to be right when he was on the record in saying that the politicians of the present era took politics as a business and for making more and more wealth.  It is indeed getting clearer day by day and night by night that the current day tall politicians had nothing but betrayed the nation.", "Natural disaster is not uncommon in this land. We experience this with regular intervals during our life time and so did our forefathers and their forefathers.  We also know well that a help is rare to come by.  Indeed, the nation knows, it has to stand on its own feet when flood water recedes.  ", "Historically, from the days of British Raj each and every flood made many people destitute and some people better off out of hoarding and pilferage of relief goods and money.  Why this time it should be different?  Every one, however, wishes that the CTG is not a political government and there is a strong force behind them in eradicating corruption, thus, they must not fail in managing such a chronic disaster.  It is sure flood has made their work even harder and it is also sure that the relief officials have not become angels overnight. It is much more stressful in watching the plight of the people and having not enough resources to offer help. ", "Having said all that, it is time to rethink strengthening the CTG by co-opting or else more manpower to face the present crisis.  This will not only help rehabilitate flood victims with an orderly fashion, will also release stress from the body and minds of the advisers, in turn, of the nation.  One would certainly hope that the president will take an appropriate step to bolster the administration.  It is still 18 months when a political regime is likely to take charge if and when election held by 2008, which both the CA and the chief of the army staff reiterated once again.", "One must not forget that this nation is not only natural disaster prone it also suffers from man-made one since its very inception.  The man-made disaster began from the period when this land was part of the eastern wing of Pakistan.  Over the last sixty years, including since the period of liberation, we hardly enjoyed a year of peace.  Nobody knows what kind of disaster is waiting in the wing during the next political cycle.  In this regard one reminds the comments made by the immediate past US Ambassador in Dhaka before her departure.  She was in the view that (if I can recall correctly?) \u201cBengalies are a great nation, however, they are conspiratorial too.\"   Who can blame her?  The events unfolded since our independence or even over the recent months certainly are mind-boggling.  ", "I was not sure whether the politicians of all persuasions yet realise this. Whatever the case, a nation cannot live without politics whether a democracy or a managed one.  The strain and scares the politicians left to the face of this nation over the last 15 years cannot be overstated.  Having said that, is post-2008 looking brighter?  Witnessing the recent events one cannot be felt reassured.  In this regard, a born again politician in this era of banned politics and his newly formed party having a free ride (PDP and its leader is in mind).", "Apparently, the way the PDP leader and his fellow party men and women are having a come back, seems a disaster waiting to happen. Why?  The way this party has been behaving even before its legitimate birth has taken everyone by surprise (demonstrating and distributing sweets when a former PM is taken into custody and recently making a broad daylight show of muscle during a so-called relief operation).

Although, very often, I hear lofty declarations over the media that the government is fully prepared and that there is enough buffer stock of food grains etc, I have a hard time believing them when your senior advisors, and I believe even you yourself, keep talking about \"setting up of monitoring cells and strengthening of Coordination Committees right through the district levels\" while   people still go hungry and have no homes or shelters to return to.

Whatever is being done can best be described as a \"drop in the ocean.\" What is also of concern is that in the midst of all these there is this issue of who is and who is not turning this issue of relief work into a political one.", "It is my gut feeling that in dealing with the entire flood situation there is visible lack of urgency, as I could gather during the past weeks from various reports in the media. I am afraid that, despite the good intentions and the good work your government has undertaken since it took charge of the administering of the country, in the end all your good work may ultimately go unnoticed and wasted. ", "May I humbly put it to you that you and your government have made the cardinal mistake, from the very beginning, of unduly extending your agenda without taking into  consideration the time and resources (money, men and material) available at your disposal. It is my opinion that you and I are here for \"creating a level field\" for holding free and fair elections and, subsequently, handing over the reins of the government to an elected civilian government, more than anything else. ", "Fixing social, moral, and ethical parameters, however important it may be, should not have been a part of the agenda of your administration. These matters are only straightened through years of social movements initiated by the members of the civil society, eminent thinkers, and the intellectual community. ", "Honourable Adviser,", "Linked with the post flood rehabilitation is also this matter of spiraling prices of essentials of daily use. Surely, you are already aware of the fact that it is causing havoc for the people all over the country. With the Ramadan approaching, and the receding of flood waters, we can visualize the situation turning from bad to worse. When an advisor says something to the effect that \"there may be further spiraling of prices following the floods, but that would be only temporary,\" I cannot but be concerned and sad, and pity the fate of the teeming millions who have already suffered enough. This is nothing short of adding insult to injury of those millions who are already reeling under spiraling of prices. I am afraid the measures so far put in place, aimed at controlling prices, are not only wrong but, in the long run, are sure to prove counterproductive.", "Honourable Adviser,", "It is all very fine and commendable that you and your government are making all out efforts to free Bangladesh from the evils of corruption, but let us also remember that it is also no less important to come to the aid of the suffering teeming millions who are poor and helpless, and to save their lives. Much of it also has not followed the due process of law of the land. I am sure you, too, are aware of that. ", "Because of the histrionics with which high profile corruption cases are being dealt with, I have this feeling that the entire exercise is slowly getting marred by the fact that a good deal of it has now turned out to be an exercise in advancing and projecting the personal profiles/images of some of your advisors, and playing to the gallery. Indeed, there is no collective thinking, nor the spirit, for the welfare of the people at large. Each of your advisors is busy trying to make a name for himself and creating a place in history.       ", "Honourable Advisor, ", "There is yet another issue I wish to dwell upon. What is happening with the Election Commission? To the best of my knowledge, no tangible progress has yet been made in preparing the critical voter list. The Commission is still talking about procuring certain vital equipment.

", "The Manipuri people, living in the green valley surrounded by high mountains in the Manipur kingdom, have from ancient times been devoted to the practice of dance and music. They gradually became a community with great artistic sense. In course of time they were scattered throughout the northeastern part of the subcontinent including Bangladesh and settled down. The Manipuri people living in these regions have nurtured and upheld their culture for ages. The Manipuri gurus (dance masters), using their impressive creative talent in music, turned Manipuri dance into a unique performing art form. From the folk tradition, the culture of the Manipuri's gradually became a classical dance form.", "A few decades ago Manipuri dance was not as popular as the other classical dance forms. But the subtlety of the tender dance form and the variety of the rhythm impressed Rabindranath Tagore so much that he is credited with introducing this enchanting style to the other parts of the world. Renowned gurus were invited to teach this dance form in Tagore's idyllic institute, Shantiniketan. Gradually the practice of this dance form extended outside the Manipuri community and was practiced with great enthusiasm, especially among the Bengalis. Following that initial period, the individual who can be credited for empowering and popularising the dance form, is Guru Bipin Singh.", "Guru Bipin Singh was born on August 24, 1918 in a family deeply involved in Manipuri Culture. His grandfather P. Tona Singh was a Manipuri Maiba (priest), his father Laikhomsana Singh was a poet and his mother Indubala Devi was a vocalist. Thus dance and music are in his blood.", "Right from his childhood Guru Bipin Singh received intensive and elaborate training in the art of Manipuri dancing from various experts residing in Manipur and its surrounding districts like Cachar, Sylhet and Tripura. Guru Bipin Singh is a rare combination of a dancer, choreographer, scholar and a teacher. For over the last 50 years he had dedicated himself to the task of exploring and revealing the classical elements of Manipuri dancing in order to preserve, promote and propagate the art form in its pristine purity.", "His genius for creating and innovating dance compositions and choreography had given him a rightful place among the choreographers of Indian dance. He composed various dance items, emphasising each classical element in a stylised way, bringing out its beauty to the fullest and keeping true to its original form and spirit. He gave a new direction to dance dramas and choreographed them keeping within the traditional framework. From within these dance dramas he chose the solo pieces and re-choreographed them for the stage, thereby making them complete. He was a pioneer in introducing solo dance performances in the Manipuri style.", "Through studies and researches, he had continually established a significant correlation between the available Vaishnavite and other Indian texts on dance, as well as the oral tradition of Manipuri dance and music. His scholastic abilities had enabled him to analyse, classify, systematise and codify various aspects of Manipuri dance and create fundamental and universal principles and disciplines to impart effective training.", "Guru Bipin Singh in collaboration with his well-known disciples Jhaveri sisters and Kalavati Devi, founded Manipuri Nartanalaya in Bombay, Kolkata and Manipur. The creative contribution of Guru Bipin Singh and the Jhaveri sisters had been to bring the traditional and classical dances of Manipur from the temples to the theatre without altering its form and spirit.", "The state of Manipur recognised his scientific attitude and scholarly approach and had accredited his 'school' of dancing as a significant 'gharana' of Manipuri dance. ", "In order to acknowledge and appreciate his contribution to the field of dance, Guru Bipin Singh was awarded with many prestigious awards among which were Nrityacharya by Maharaja of Manipur, National Sangeet Natok Academy awards given by Late Indira Gandhi, Uday Shankar Fellowship Calcutta, Kalidas Samman Madhya Pradesh, Anamika Kala Sangam Awards Calcutta and many others.", "Guru Bipin Singh's teachings and the Manipuri dance style were popularised in Bangladesh by Shantibala Sinha and Kalavati Devi at Chhayanat.

We learnt our lessons the hard way in 1973 during counter-insurgency operations in Balochistan, and the subalterns of that era comprise the military hierarchy at this time.  Obviously, the lessons were lost on them, or they did not actively participate in the operations.", "For the Balochistan operations, 60 Brigade was detached from 33 Division and placed directly under the command of Corps HQ. 60 Brigade was a particularly good fighting formation. Experiencing war together in the Thar desert in 1971, plus Chor and Umarkot, we had taken part in Internal Security (1S) Duties in 1972 in Sindh before pulling back to the forward defended localities (FDLs), both officers and men had trained together, whenever possible wherever possible.

Out of touch with Brigade HQ, Shafi had been sent to locate us. He was shocked when we told him that there were no casualties.  46 Baluch was in deep trouble, there had been several deaths due to heatstroke, and several MI-8 helicopters were ferrying dozens to the field hospital in Sibi and even directly to Quetta; most of the unit was suffering from heat exhaustion. The heli-lifted company of 45 Punjab had secured Maiwand and the rest of the unit had been pulled back to Sibi. Staff College was out, reality had sunk in. Theory had been hit for a six as \"Phase\" lines, a la Staff College, melted in the sun.", "The responsibility for the death of the soldiers of 46 Baluch on that hot day rests on those who chose one of the hottest days of the year, with troops wearing metal helmets without any protective clothing to lessen the impact of concentrated sun rays.

Nothing was done to the two Commanders concerned for the unnecessary deaths in their command, the Brigade Commander was later promoted to Maj Gen and the Corps Comd retired as a much acclaimed professional.

Stock markets in the United States and Europe reacted favourably to this move. ", "What the Fed is really trying to do is to halt the process of the modern equivalent of a run on the banks. Before financial engineering became too sophisticated, bank depositors used to react to financial panic with runs on banks. Unfortunately, such panic reactions often snowballed, causing perfectly healthy institutions to fail because of their inability to raise enough cash quickly. In order to avoid such a situation, the central banks across the world, including the Fed and the ECB, had already injected billions of dollars into the system. How did this liquidity crunch begin?", "The entire financial system is based on people's trust and confidence. As long as people have confidence in the system, it functions smoothly. But if there is a crisis of confidence in any one of the sectors of the financial market, it has a tendency to spread like wildfire to other sectors as well. Under normal circumstances, one should be able to convert certain financial instruments into cash without any difficulty. But if people stop buying financial instruments like the collateralised debt obligations (CDO) with triple A ratings, inevitably there is a liquidity crisis.", "As Professor Paul Krugman of the University of Princeton wrote recently: \"when liquidity dries up, it can produce a chain reaction of defaults.\" Although many experts had hoped that the crisis would be limited to the CDOs market, it did not come as a big surprise when the turmoil of the sub-prime mortgage market started spreading to other parts of the securities market, like the short-term commercial papers. ", "Commercial papers are short-term promissory notes (IOUs), issued by corporations that promise to repay the loans within a few weeks or a few months. They are easily convertible and are supposed to finance day-to-day operations, not long-term investments like fixed assets. But now that the rating agencies have warned that some of these promissory notes could be downgraded because they are backed by residential mortgages, the liquidity crisis has intensified, hence the recent corrective measures taken by the central banks. ", "We do not know yet whether these measures would be enough to correct the situation, but questions are already being asked as to who bears the responsibility for this crisis.", "Derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the value of underlying stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, and mortgages. The ever-innovative financiers are experts in this sort of financial engineering. \"Mortgages were bundled with others and sold to investment banks, which in turn sliced and diced the claims to produce artificial assets that Moody's or Standard & Poor's were willing to classify as AAA.\" That means that, in theory, they were as safe as the US Treasury securities. Therefore, the rating agencies are primarily responsible for this debacle. ", "In fact, as far as the rating agencies are concerned, this is a clear case of conflict of interest. The rating agencies, which work as unofficial regulators, are supposed to be independent overseers. Yet, they collect a huge amount of fees from the issuers of these CDOs for rating them. It seems that the investment banks knew more about the growing risks of the sub-prime market. Several due-diligence firms like Clayton Holdings or Opus Capital Markets issued damaging due-diligence reports and submitted them to their clients, the investment banks. Summaries of these reports were given to the rating agencies by the investment banks, but not the full reports that might have helped the rating agencies to evaluate the securities better unless, of course, they (the rating agencies) preferred not to find out more about them. Therefore, the investment banks also share some of the responsibilities for this sub-prime mortgage meltdown. Whatever the case, this is a serious market failure. It is time for the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, and the Securities and Exchange Commission to sit together and come up with measures which would give greater transparency to financial transactions in the future."], "tag": ["Editorial"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=1138", "location": null, "date": "2007-08-23"}

We have been hearing of various enquiries and investigations being conducted over the last there years. But we are yet to get any idea of the major findings of these investigations. Recent police statements suggest that the investigations are all but completed and charges would be framed soon. That being the case, would it not help matters, apart from assuaging the concern of the people, if we were told of the important aspects of the case. It needs to be done because there are many questions that, regrettably, still remain unanswered. This is a matter that has far reaching implications for the country's security.  ", "Admittedly, it may not always be possible for the government to reveal all the information or intelligence gathered in the process of investigation, both for the sake of future probe in this matter as well as others related to the issue, and also for the sake of national security. But it is essential that the public be made aware of the progress of the case and the direction the agencies are heading towards.", "I am aware of at least one inquiry commission, the one-man Justice Muhammed Joynal Abedin Commission, which had long since submitted its report to the government, in October 2004. While we have not had the benefit of the committee's important conclusions, what is perhaps more worrisome is the contradictory statements from higher echelons of the administration, including the investigating agencies, giving different views of the case which have compounded confusions even more.", "Since August 21, 2004, there have been several terrorist attacks in Bangladesh that were motivated by religious extremism. The most serious of which was on August 17, 2005. Through these bombings the religious radicals made their formal appearance, although there was very little doubt about the religious or ideological orientation of the perpetrators of most of the bombings in the country since the Udichi incident of 1999. The leadership of the JMB, perpetrators of the August 17th  bombings as well as some of the previous ones too, have been sent to the gallows, but we have not yet gone deep into the group's operation, sponsors, and motivators.  ", "But the incident of August 21 remains a mystery despite the statement of the police chief.  We compliment the IGP for being so candid and definitively clear about the complicity of Mufti Hannan and HUJI (B) in organizing and conducting the August 21 attack. It is for the first time in three years that we have heard such conclusive statements about the perpetrators of the August 21 attack. With several simultaneous enquiries being conducted at the same time, one would not be wrong in suggesting, given the statements in the press on August 21 on the matter, that the police chief's assured reflection (to a private TV channel on August 21) on Hannan being the main person behind the attack is a remarkable revelation. ", "But what he added after that is equally interesting. It throws a new insight on the operational mechanism of terrorists. He has suggested that Mufti Hannan might have obtained the help of other terror groups to conduct the attack. While outsourcing jobs is not new, this is the first time that one has heard of one terrorist group outsourcing its tasks to another. So what should one make of the \"George Mia\" episode? And what conclusions should people draw from whatever little that was leaked from Justice Abedin's enquiry report regarding involvement of a foreign intelligence agency?  All one can say by way of comment on the published interrogation report of Mufti Hannan is that there are enough holes in the statement to stitch a fairly large fishing net with.  ", "I started by calling the failure to come to a conclusive finding regarding August 21 attack appalling, not because it has remained unresolved, but because of the manner in which the case was handled. The soft peddling on the matter was evident, and there was red herring deliberately thrown to derail the investigations. What we have today are contradictory and confusing statements from the relevant agencies dealing with the case. Nothing can be more damaging than bringing partisan influence to bear on the investigating agencies of any case, not to speak of a case like the August 21 bombing that, had it succeeded in its mission, would have created a severe political and, consequently, a security crisis for us. Therefore, the investigating agencies must go deep into the facts revealed, not only by the arrested militants, particularly Mufti Hannan, but also by the Joynal Commission report. ", "Of interest to us is what the press has termed the biggest revelation of the Joynal Commission report. The justice has found links to \"foreign enemies apart from local ones.\" We are not aware of the facts that helped him reach such a conclusion, but this should not be brushed aside as merely speculative since the possibility of involvement of a terrorist organisation from across the border has also been in the press reports. If a \"foreign enemy\" could conduct such an attack in the heart of the capital, there must have been local collaborators to help them. While not going into the cost benefit analysis or the motive of an external terrorist group in undertaking such a venture, we should consider such a possibility and discard or accept it through the process of elimination. What we ought to consider is that it is not possible for the group to have infiltrated, carried out the task and escaped, without local help. Who is that local abettor? Is there more than one? This must be gone deep into. ", "I am inclined to believe that there are grounds to see the two incidents -- August 17 and 21 -- as being compelled by different motives. The former was entirely ideologically moored, while political motives drove the attack against Sheikh Hasina and her senior party leaders. While it is not my intention to throw a spanner in the works of the intelligence agencies, the description by Mufti Hannan, of his preparation and planning for the attack and the method of conduct, throws up many questions to which the agencies no doubt will seek answers.", "There is yet another equally important matter that we would want answered -- that of the local sponsors of the religious militants as well as their nexus with political parties. Several persons, including a senior BNP minister, have recently been sentenced to long prison sentences for abetting the militants. But statements of many of the arrested militants suggest an elemental link between them and the Jamaat-e-Islami, which has been denied by Jamaat.

Because of its interesting environmental conditions, it offers a wide range of outdoor recreational opportunities. Naturally, mangroves can attract a large number of tourists and be a source of earning through national and overseas tourism. In many countries, tourism in the mangrove environment has been developed. Revenue earned through eco-tourism from one hectare in a wildlife sanctuary in Kenya, exceeds many times the most optimistic projected return from agriculture. There is also evidence that the economic benefits derived from forest-based eco-tourism surpass the revenue earned from timber harvesting. It is important to note that preservation of forests, specially mangroves can be compatible to tourism if well planned. ", "Eco-tourism is a sustainable form of land use, which contributes to environmental conservation, while providing accrued socio-economic benefits to the indigenous people through the non-consumptive uses and indirect values of the natural biological resources. Considering the vulnerable nature of our environment eco-tourism must be encouraged. Eco-tourism should be based on the following principles: (i) optimum multiple use of the resources; (ii) maximum sustainable use; and (iii) conservation and development of natural resources. Obviously, tourist products should be used in such a way that they are not destroyed. Tourists, who unmindfully or without caring litter the spots leftovers cause damage to the local environment and eventually the earth. ", "One way to handle such problems is to regulate tourists visits to each place. Restrictions can be imposed on the number of tourists, and on how they undertake their visit, before a site becomes overcrowded. Without controls, it is obvious that the more tourists visit a place, the more its ecological balance may be threatened or degraded. However, we do not restrict tourism. If we can apply the principles of sustainable development, tourism could be encouraged to grow. More forests could be declared as sanctuaries for tigers, deer, elephants and crocodiles to attract more tourists. There are good laws in Bangladesh to protect the environment but these are rarely enforced. The goal of eco-tourism development in Bangladesh should be to capture a portion of the enormous global tourism market by attracting visitors and using the revenues to fund local conservation and fuel economic development.", "The Sundarbans is a unique ecosystem. Its exceptional scenic beauty and rich wildlife can be source of attraction to different levels of people and is convenient for outdoor recreation. Eco-tourism may be developed without causing damage to vegetation and wildlife. Because of weather condition tourism may be limited to winter months when the climate is fabourable. The only way to visit the Sundarbans is by water transport. Adequate water transport and accommodation facilities inside the forests are to be created to attract local and foreign tourists. In fact the recreational potentiality of the Sundarbans has never been utilized. Facilities needed for the tourists have not been developed. There is immense potentiality of the Sundarbans for earning through tourism. Eco tourism spots in this World Heritage site can easily attract the tourist from everywhere. Some of these sites are as following:", "Katka is an eye catching and quiet island located in the north-west part of Sundarbans. Katka is an excellent and favourable spot, where visitors can enjoy bird watching, wildlife especially Royal Bengal Tiger and deer, roaming around by country boat through small creeks and canals and also by walking through the forest. One can also enjoy swimming and sun bathing at Katka's desolate white sand beach.", "Kachikhali is a roaming and breeding ground for the Royal Bengal Tiger and is also known as \"Tiger Point\". There is a Forest Department resort, which is used by the tourists. Visitors spend their time by walking around the tiger point, Katka-Kachikhali beach and visiting the Egg Island or Dimer Char, a small island close to Kachikhali.", "Nilkamal is a beautiful place along the Bay of Bengal. The World Heritage plaque was unveiled at Hiron Point of Nilkamal. The combined beauty of sea and green mangroves Nilkamal must attract visitors from the watchtower of Keorasuthi another attractive spot there. Thousands of spotted deer, birds and sometimes a Royal Bengal Tiger can be seen from the tower.", "Dublar Char is an island famous for drying fish during the month of November-February in the winter season. This place is also famous for religious festival of Hindu community popularly known as \"Rashmela\" that takes place at the end of November. Visitors come here to see the life  of fisherman and their unique fish drying. These dry fish or 'sutki' is exported to domestic and foreign markets as a delicacy.", "The Sundarbans comprises 45 percent of the total productive forest of the country, contributing about one-half of the forest related revenue. About 50 to 60 thousand people work regularly and continuously for about six months, while the number of people entering the forest in a year can be as high as 3.5 million for minor forest product collection and fishing. Of these about 25 thousand  work for fish drying, 200 thousand get engaged in shrimp fry collection in the rivers and creeks around the Sundarbans. About 2.5 million people live in the villages surrounding the Sundarbans, while the number of people within 20km of the forest boundary is 3.14 million. The main forest products are timber, firewood, thatching material, newsprint raw material, honey and wax, fish and crabs, shrimp fry and miscellaneous items. Of all the products the fishery of Sundarban represents the most important non-wood component which constitutes 5 percent of the total fish harvest of Bangladesh. Eco-tourism is a major component of the Sundarban Biodiversity Conservation Project. It comprises a range of integrated activities. ", "Although generally it has been said that tourism in Bangladesh suffers from a poor image, but eco-tourism potential, on the contrary, is rated high. Presently it is in a very early but promising stage of development. The Sundarbans is unique of Bangladesh. This is because of its majestic beauty, richness of biodiversity and tranquillity. There are many aspects to learn and enjoy from this largest mangrove forest. ", "The Sundarbans represents a charming mystery. It is home of the Royal Bengal Tiger. It provides a peaceful and relaxing refuge from the population density of Bangladesh. Every year innumerable people visit this unique forest. But most of them do not have any sound knowledge about eco-tourism. Their actions often harm the environment in many different ways. Sound pollution is one of them. Many visitors like to enjoy music very loudly, which can be  upsetting to the quiet and serene environment. The development of eco-tourism in the Sundarbans should be given top priority both by the Forest Department and the Sundarbans Biodiversity Conservation Project.

{"reporter": "Md. Asadullah Khan", "headline": ["Ozone layer depletion: The threat mounts"], "lastModified": null, "newsBody": ["The Earth's atmosphere is divided into several layers. The lowest region, the troposphere, extends from the Earth's surface up to about 10 kilometers (km) in altitude. Virtually all human activities occur in the troposphere. Mt. Everest, the tallest mountain on the planet, is only about 9 km high. The next layer, the stratosphere, continues from 10 km to about 50 km. Most commercial airline traffic occurs in the lower part of the stratosphere.", "Most atmospheric ozone is concentrated in a layer in the stratosphere, about 15-30 kilometers above the Earth's surface. Ozone is a molecule containing three oxygen atoms. It is blue in colour and has a strong odour. Normal oxygen, which we breathe, has two oxygen atoms and is colourless and odourless. Ozone is much less common than normal oxygen. Out of each 10 million air molecules, about 2 million are normal oxygen, but only 3 are ozone.", "Laboratory and epidemiological studies demonstrate that Ultra Violet-B (UV-B) causes non melanoma skin cancer and plays a major role in malignant melanoma development. In addition, UV-B has been linked to cataracts. All sunlight contains some UV-B, even with normal ozone levels. It is always important to limit exposure to the sun. However, ozone depletion will increase the amount of UV-B, which will then increase the risk of health effects. Furthermore, UV-B harms some crops, plastics and other materials, and certain types of marine life. Higher air temperatures also increase the concentration of ozone at ground level. The natural layer of ozone in the upper atmosphere blocks harmful ultraviolet radiation from reaching the earth's surface; but in the lower atmosphere ozone is a harmful pollutant. It damages lung tissue and causes particular problems for people with asthma and other lung diseases.", "Shockingly, the incidence of skin cancer in the United States has reached epidemic proportions. Health experts predict that one in five Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime. Excess UV radiation may also affect the body's general ability to fight off disease. Says immunologist Margaret Kripke M.D. of the Anderson Cancer Centre in Houston, \u201cWe already know that ultraviolet light can impair immunity to infectious diseases in animals. We know that there are immunological effects in humans, though we don't yet know their significance\u201d. One impending tragedy is the possible blinding of almost all non-nocturnal animals and insects outside the darkest jungle. While humans can certainly protect their eyes, most other forms of life can't.", "However, even the small amount of ozone plays a key role in the atmosphere. The ozone layer absorbs a portion of the radiation from the sun, preventing it from reaching the planet's surface. Most importantly, it absorbs the portion of ultraviolet light called UV-B.", "At any given time, ozone molecules are constantly formed and destroyed in the stratosphere. The total amount, however, remains relatively stable. While ozone concentrations vary naturally with sunspots, the seasons, and latitude, these processes are well understood and predictable. Scientists have established records spanning several decades that detail normal ozone levels during these natural cycles. Each natural reduction in ozone levels has been followed by a recovery. Recently, however, convincing scientific evidence has shown that the ozone shield is being depleted well beyond changes due to natural processes.", "For over 50 years, chlorofluorocarbons -- CFCs (compounds containing Chlorine, Fluorine and Carbon) were thought of as miracle substances. They are stable, nonflammable, low in toxicity, and inexpensive to produce. Over time, CFCs found uses as refrigerants, solvents, foam blowing agents, and in other smaller applications. Other chlorine-containing compounds include methyl chloroform, a solvent and carbon tetrachloride, an industrial chemical. or bromine. When they break down, they damage the protective ozone layer.", "In the early 1970s, researchers began to investigate the effects of various chemicals on the ozone layer, particularly CFCs, which contain chlorine. They also examined the potential impacts of other chlorine sources. Chlorine from swimming pools, industrial plants, sea salt, and volcanoes does not reach the stratosphere. Chlorine compounds from these sources readily combine with water and repeated measurements show that they rain out of the troposphere very quickly. In contrast, CFCs are very stable and do not dissolve in rain. Thus, there are no natural processes that remove the CFCs from the lower atmosphere. Over time, winds drive the CFCs into the stratosphere.", "The CFCs are so stable that only exposure to strong UV radiation breaks them down. When that happens, the CFC molecule releases atomic chlorine which is highly active. One chlorine atom can destroy over 100,000 ozone molecules. The net effect is to destroy ozone faster than it is naturally created. ", "Large fires and certain types of marine life produce one stable form of chlorine that does reach the stratosphere. However, numerous experiments have shown that CFCs and other widely-used chemicals produce roughly 85 percent of the chlorine in the stratosphere, while natural sources contribute only 15 percent. Large volcanic eruptions can have an indirect effect on ozone levels. ", "One example of ozone depletion is the annual ozone \"hole\" over Antarctica that has occurred during the Antarctic Spring since the early 1980s. Rather than being a literal hole through the layer, the ozone hole is a large area of the stratosphere with extremely low amounts of ozone. Ozone levels fall by over 60 percent during the worst years.", "In addition, research has shown that ozone depletion occurs over the latitudes that include North America, Europe, Asia, and much of Africa, Australia, and South America. Over the U.S., ozone levels have fallen 5-10 percent, depending on the season. Thus, ozone depletion is a global issue and not just a problem at the South Pole.", "Reductions in ozone levels will lead to higher levels of UV-B reaching the Earth's surface. The sun's output of UV-B does not change; rather, less ozone means less protection, and hence more UV-B. Studies have shown that in the Antarctic, the amount of UV-B measured at the surface can double during the annual ozone hole. ", "Just as worrisome is the threat to world's food supply. High doses of UV radiation can reduce the yield of basic crops such as soybeans. UV-B, penetrates scores of metres below the surface of oceans. There the radiation can kill phytoplankton (one celled plants) and Krill (tiny shrimp like animals) which are at the bottom of the ocean food chain. Since these organisms found in greatest concentrations in Antarctic waters and nourish larger fish, the ultimate consumers -- humans -- may face a maritime food shortage.", "Let us think for a moment about the world's one billion refrigerators, hundreds of millions of air conditioners, mountains of foam insulation, seat cushions, furniture stuffing and carpet padding, streams of cleaning fluids, rivers of industrial solvents, wafting clouds of aerosol spray, all of them setting free the CFCs that destroy the ozone layer.", "Ridding the world of the millions of tons of ozone depleting chemicals is a huge, costly and complex task requiring unprecedented international cooperation. Since du Pont began marketing the miracle refrigerant called Freon, CFCs have worked their way deep into the machinery of what much of the world thinks as modern life. Extricating the planet from the chemical burden of that high-tech lifestyle will require not only technical ingenuity but extra-ordinary leadership qualities.", "The technical challenge is to find substances and processes that can replace CFC-based systems without doing further harm to the stratosphere. Happily, that endeavour has worked. In fact, it has turned out to be much easier than anyone expected. Except for medical aerosols, some fire-fighting equipment and certain metal cleaning applications there are now effective substitutes for virtually every ozone-depleting chemical. Assuringly, in a surprising number of cases, the new processes are actually cheaper and better than the old.", "But the harm or danger is lurking in somewhere else and so replacing CFCs in newly built equipment, however, is only half the job. Virtually every existing refrigerator and air conditioner is a CFC reservoir. The chemicals are not a problem as long as they continue to circulate within an appliance. But if the machine is carelessly drained, junked or damaged, the CFCs can escape to attack the ozone. The real task for those countries that invested heavily in CFCs in the past is to develop systems for recovering and recycling the chemicals they have already used. Undoubtedly true, the US, Europe and other industrialised countries bear direct responsibility for most of the damage that has been done and they can best afford the costs attached to switching technologies. But what about the countries of the Second and Third World? Many of them are just beginning to enjoy the comforts of CFC technology, and they cannot easily go for a changeover.

South-Asia is the least integrated zone in the world. In this age of globalisation and regional cooperation which has led to prosperity of European Union, Asean, Apec, instead of cooperation we have been content with confrontation. Endeavours towards cooperation in the shape of Saarc, Sapta and Safta the progress is zero. Regional conflicts between India and Pakistan and Kashmir hardly promotes friendly relations. ", "When I attended the Saarc Businessmen Conclave in Bombay in February 2007 the fact that stood out conspicuously was how similar in appearance, English/Urdu/Hindi accent and friendly interpersonal warmth the six hundred delegates were from the Saarc countries. It was difficult to tell which delegate came from which country. At the personal level there was abundance of friendship and goodwill. ", "The most appropriate document to pore over first would be the Sachar Report on Social, Economic and Educational Status of the Muslim Community of India (November 2006) The very fact that the Government of India thought it fit to enquire into the Muslim problem is a testimony enough to reflect how the Muslims are being left behind. This four hundred page report is an exceptionally candid document which details the backwardness of the Muslims in India. ", "Just one or two statistics to highlight the state of affairs. The current Muslim population is over 150 million about the same as Pakistan and Bangladesh which at the time of partition was about 50 million. At the current rate of growth in the decade of 2030s the Muslim population would stabilise at about 320 million. The presence of Muslims was found to be only 3% in the IAS, 1.8% in the IFS and 4% in the IPS. ", "The Indian constitutional provision for special consideration for backward classes excludes most of the Muslims. The Mandal Commission report for the prosperity of Other Backward Classes (OBC) remains largely not implemented. There is an abundance of literature on the plight of Muslims in India. The prominent authors are A.G. Noorani, Mushirul Hasan, Bimal Prasad, etc.", "Let us turn to the situation in Pakistan. It must be recalled that none of the provinces had Muslim League government in 1947; therefore, their concept of Pakistan is nowhere near what Jinnah had in mind. In the last 60 years Pakistan has had martial law government for 32 years and for the rest of the time political turmoil. ", "The very existence of Pakistan is threatened by Islamic extremism. By many Pakistan has been declared a failed state. In the present era of secular democratic governance can a state be based on religion? ", "Bangladesh fares slightly better as the country is ethnically, religiously and linguistically uniform. But still even Bangladesh in its 36 years existence has had 16 years of martial law. ", "M.C. Chagla, Jinnah's junior in his legal chamber once asked him what would happen to all the Muslims who would be left behind in India. Jinnah looked at Chagla for a while and said: \"They will look after themselves. I am not interested in their fate.\" ", "The Morley-Minto reforms of 1909, by requiring communities to vote separately accordingly to their faiths, had poisoned the atmosphere with communalism and encouraged the formation of political parties on religious lines, thus undercutting the support of a secular party like the Congress. ", "Montagu Chelmsford reforms 1919 and later Ramsay McDonalds Communal Award gave it further extension. The 1919 Act provided that its working would be reviewed in ten years. This led to the holding of three Round Table Conferences in 1931-32 to frame a scheme of a Dominion Constitution for India. ", "The ultimate outcome of the Round Table Conferences was the definitive Government of India Act 1935. The chief aim of the act was to maintain the unity of India by federating the Princely States with the British-Indian provinces, and by granting responsible government to the provinces. These measures were the initial steps to grant full dominion status to India. ", "If the 1935 Act had been fully implemented and responsible government had been established at the centre before the outbreak of the war, the story of the Transfer of Power in India might have been different. Independence would have perhaps come no later than it did, but partition might have been avoided.", "In the elections held in October 1936 Congress emerged as a majority party in five provinces and largest single party in two others. On the contrary the Muslim League's showing was extremely poor with the League gaining only 105 seats out of 489 reserved for Muslims. At first Congress refused to form ministries in their majority provinces but finally joined in July 1937 in order \"to destroy the constitution from within.\" ", "At the same time Congress, in its hesitation to accept office missed chances of forming coalition government in Bengal and Punjab. Had the Congress shown some flexibility and tolerance with the League and the Princes there was a good chance of forming the Federation. ", "For various factors the Federation envisaged in the 1935 Act never took off. One of the factors, which helped to kill the Federation, was the hostility of the Muslim League towards the Federation as the League failed to form a government in any of the provinces. ", "The elections in the United Provinces (UP) caused a serious rift between the Congress and the Muslim League. Congress had won 133 seats out of 228 against only 27 by the League. Till the elections Congress-League relationship had been extremely cordial. ", "A very strange incident occurred at this time as the Congress offered a coalition government to Muslim League in UP provided the UP League agreed to cease to function as a separate group in the legislature. This would be the price for taking one or two members in the UP cabinet. ", "Naturally this condition was unacceptable to the League, which resulted not only in the withdrawal of the offer but had countrywide repercussion heralding the parting of ways between the Congress and the League. ", "In Bengal out of the 119 seats reserved for the Muslims, Independents got 43, Muslim League 39, and Fazlul Huq's Krishak Praja Party 36. The obvious choice before the parties was a Congress-KPP coalition, which totalled 96 and another 30 to form a majority could have easily been obtained from the Independent members. But the largest party Congress (60 seats) could have initiated a proposal for a coalition had it not been for the indecision of the All India Congress Committee (AICC). ", "Nevertheless, Congress-KPP coalition had been reached but at the signing ceremony Congress backed out on a flimsy ground no doubt following orders from Congress high command. This event is elaborately recorded by eyewitness Abul Mansur Ahmed. ", "Then began the story of Muslim League-KPP coalition with the masterly intervention of Jinnah. Muslim League which had no footing in the rest of India used Bengal and its Muslims to establish the League India-wide. For details read the voluminous Jinnah-Ispahani Correspondence. ", "Not a leaf moved in Bengal without Jinnah's directive via M.A.H. Ispahani. In fact, it would not be wrong to say that Jinnah rode on the backs of the Bengali Muslims to create Pakistan. ", "At that time apart from Jinnah there were only two Muslim leaders with the potential of All India leadership. One was Fazlul Huq and the other Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy. In the League-KPP coalition Fazlul Huq became chief minister, Suhrawardy and Nazimuddin were also included in the cabinet. This was just the beginning of Jinnah's scheme. ", "During the Muslim League-KPP government Fazlul Huq tried his best for communal harmony. In fact, in the cabinet Hindu-Muslims were equal in number. Also with Muslim League pressure, KPP was sidetracked. On December 5, 1941 Fazlul Huq was expelled by Jinnah for writing an outspoken letter regarding his membership of the Viceroy's Defense Council. Actually this was not a major issue since Jinnah was helping the British government in defence matters. ", "Fazlul Huq's Shyama-Huq ministry sworn in December 11, 1941 collapsed on March 28, 1943 due to consistent and persistent sabotage by the Muslim League, making way for Nazimuddin to take over. Jinnah had conveniently got rid of Fazlul Huq who had no role to play after that. ", "A prominent leader like Suhrawardy was never inducted into the All India Muslim League Committee. This was a deliberate strategy of Jinnah not to allow Suhrawardy to become a national leader. In fact, had the Muslim League used leaders like Fazlul Huq and Suhrawardy at the national level, the story of partition may have been different.", "There was nothing absolutely inevitable about the partition of India: prior to 1939 and the demand for the partition of the country on a communal basis had never been seriously considered. The outbreak of war in September 1939 and the subsequent resignation of the Congress ministries introduced a new element in the Indian politics: the Congress lost its bargaining power. ", "Jinnah was not slow to recognise the changed situation. He remarked: \"After the war began . . . I was treated on the same basis as Mr. Gandhi. I was wonderstruck why all of a sudden I was promoted and given a place side by side with Mr. Gandhi.\" ", "Congress started agitating against the British government for taking India into the war without consultation with the Indian leaders. To meet the exigencies of the war Viceroy Linlithgow set about strengthening the League so that it would be on an equal footing with the Congress. ", "The British government via Linlithgow began to urge Muslim League to put forward \"concrete proposals\" to counteract Congress's demand for independence. Linlithgow spoke to Jinnah on several occasions, telling him that unless he took some positive actions the League's case would go by default. ", "It is to counter this situation that the Muslim League passed the Lahore Resolution on March 23, 1940, which became known as the Pakistan Resolution. Very shrewdly Jinnah used Fazlul Huq to table this resolution in the Muslim League meeting. In retrospect we see that Linlithgow was the real author of the Pakistan Resolution. ", "All solutions hitherto thought of -- separate electorates, composite cabinets, reservation of seats -- suddenly became out of date. Undoubtedly, the Muslim military personnel helping the British war effort were by far out of proportion to the Muslim population. The great friend of the Muslims Winston Churchill held the view that 75% of the soldiers from India were Muslims. ", "No sooner had the Congress resigned from eight provinces Linlithgow promptly promulgated Section 93 Governor's rule and all was well for the British. Meanwhile, in the war the British forces suffered serious setback in the European sector and in South-East Asia also the British were on the retreat.", "It is generally not appreciated the role Sir Stafford Cripps played in the Indian partition period. From 1942 to 1950 Stafford Cripps was a powerful member of both Churchill and Attlee cabinets. In fact, it will be seen that Cripps was in the driving seat in Indian affairs and played a pivotal role in the independence of India. Nehru and Cripps were old friends Cripps was publicly calling Nehru's friendship, the greatest privilege of his life. ", "On Nehru's visit to Europe in 1938, he and his daughter Indira stayed with Cripps one weekend at Goodfellows. On that weekend the other house guests included Attlee, Bevan, and Laski. It was here that the basis of the plan for Indian independence was first formulated.  ", "On the intervention of the US president to placate India, British government sent Stafford Cripps in March 1942 with a proposal to give assurance about self rule by the Indians after the war and to Indianise the viceroy's council. ", "The Cripps proposal was frustrated by Gandhi's infamous uttering: \"a postdated cheque on a failing bank.\" Although all credit must be given to Gandhi for being consistently and persistently against partition of India, yet he must be given the accolade of being the first communalist Indian leader. ", "In 1915 when Gandhi returned from South Africa the Gujarat Society gave a welcome garden party chaired by Jinnah. Gandhi's response was: \"I am glad to find a Mahomedan not only belonging to my region's Sabha but also chairing it.\" That first communal statement of Gandhi set the tone of their relationship, always at odds with the tensions and mistrust underlined its superficially polite manners. ", "With the failure of Cripps's mission ended another chance of keeping India united. Immediately afterwards the Congress launched their Quit India movement which compelled the British to incarcerate all the Indian leaders including Gandhi. ", "Meanwhile, the war situation had improved both in the Eastern and the Western Fronts and the Indian problem was put on the backburner. Jinnah's position remained firm throughout the remaining years of World War II and the League was given equal status as Congress. In June 1943 Linlithgow was replaced by Lord Wavell as the Viceroy of India. Wavell's tenure was a benevolent sympathetic and neutral period of governance. ", "Wavell tried his best to keep India united. Not much happened till the end of the war when the Congress leaders were released from jail when Labour Party came into power in Britain. In an endeavour to form a totally Indian interim government, Wavell summoned some prominent leaders to Simla in June 1945. Twenty two political leaders of India assembled in Simla. ", "The general idea was to form an Indian interim government with the various contenders balanced. Jinnah took the stand that the only Muslim League would nominate the Muslim members of the cabinet. This proved to be impossible as Jinnah refused to relent. ", "The utter failure of Wavell's Simla conference served only to underscore the intensity of communal distrust that had become India's key political problem. Many British officials expected that this failure would weaken Jinnah's power over the League, but his presidential position seemed instead to grow stronger. Wavell wrote in his diary: \"Jinnah \u2026 narrow and arrogant \u2026 actuated mainly by fear and distrust of the Congress \u2026 constitutionally incapable of friendly cooperation with the other party.\" ", "Jinnah's intransigence appeared to be the main obstacle to a solution and a golden opportunity missed to keep India united. It is incredible to imagine now that in that conference Congress was prepared to concede parity of numbers between Hindu and Muslim members of interim government. What a chance missed by the League!

{"reporter": "CricInfo", "headline": ["Back to speed"], "lastModified": null, "newsBody": ["\"If people call my home and get the answer 'He is at his second home',\" Munaf Patel says, \"they know I am in Chennai, at MRF.\" Indeed, the pace academy seems to have become something of a home away from home for Munaf -- much like a boarding-school kid who does not want to go home during vacations because he won't be able to play there. Whenever he finds the time, Munaf comes to Chennai. He has been doing so for five years now.", "It is easy to see that Munaf is at home at MRF. In Chennai he is a relaxed man. If he has much on his mind, he doesn't show it. He has bonded with the students at the school; he has picked up some Tamil; he knows the names of the kids who come for autographs. (\"They come every year,\" he says.) After a period of play with the children, who are clearly having a ball after a day at school, he gets to the nets.", "The nets are housed in the premises of the Madras Christian College High School. The ground is quite nondescript, and even the immediate neighbours would likely not be able to provide directions if one asked for the MRF Pace Academy. It is just the kind of place for an international fast bowler in rehabilitation.", "In a career of just over a year, Munaf has broken down twice -- in fact, since November last he has largely been a passenger with the team. He did not play a single full Test on the South Africa tour. He then missed the four-ODI series against West Indies but returned in time for the World Cup, which for India lasted just three matches. He then broke down with a back injury in Bangladesh. The selectors, this time, decided to be stern and sent him back home. Before the England tour Munaf was declared fit at the bowlers' conditioning camp in Mysore. And then he was found to be less than match-fit just before the team was picked.", "Munaf cannot not know that he has got himself a reputation for dubious fitness. The comments made by Sandeep Patil in 2004, when he coached the India A team that Munaf was a part of, began to ring true last year. \"Munaf was a big disappointment,\" Patil had said. \"He developed a shoulder injury. The physio checked him and said everything was okay. But he could not bowl and finish his spells. I see it as more of a mental problem than physical. He played one-and-a-half matches in a one-and-a-half-month tour.\"", "\"He has let us down,\" a national selector was quoted as saying by The Times of India recently. \"We cannot keep picking him again and again just on promise. He has to back it up with fitness and play out a full series.\"", "At the academy, head coach TA Sekhar is happy with what he sees. He does not believe Munaf is a walking magnet for injuries. \"He does have a fast twitch to his muscles, which gets him the pace, but he is not a special case.\"", "At the nets Munaf works up a good pace; he is visibly faster than any of the others there, Irfan Pathan included. The mind goes back to a recent article written by Mike Selvey in The Guardian, bemoaning the lack of fast bowlers in world cricket. \"Where are the genuine pace aces?\" Selvey wrote. \"There is (Brett) Lee certainly, (Steve) Harmison when he can be roused and Shane Bond when fit. The three slingers -- (Fidel) Edwards, Shaun Tait and Lasith Malinga -- are rapid, but that is about it really, isn't it?\"", "A little over a year ago Munaf would perhaps have been part of that roster. Back then he was hitting about 140kph consistently, impressing all who saw him. During the Champions Trophy last year, though, a new Munaf was on display -- running in from wide of the stumps and moving towards them in the final leap; more accurate, economical, but down on pace. Although he had developed into India's best one-day bowler, the change surprised everyone -- not least Sekhar.", "\"To me, he was asked to bowl like (Glenn) McGrath, that's where the problem started,\" Sekhar says. But that doesn't explain Munaf's brittleness, does it? It does, according to Sekhar -- at least the latest back injury.", "\"The idea behind fast bowling is to have all your movements towards the batsman,\" Sekhar says. \"He ran in straight, but he jumped towards fine leg, just before the stride. The batsman suddenly was at a different angle.", "\"Naturally and biomechanically, if your force doesn't go in the right direction, problems are bound to happen. McGrath can do it because he is bloody strong. Munaf is strong but not that strong. When you are bowling that way, you have to rotate to bowl. Naturally there is a twist. Initially it would have been stiffness, then pain; then he is not able to bowl.\" Munaf has now eliminated that final sideways movement, but just why did he do it in the first place?", "\"I thought line and length was more important in one-day cricket,\" he says. \"I was feeling good with that action; the team was getting good support too. I was feeling good because that inward jump made the away-going delivery more effective.\" One wonders if the presence of a specialist bowling coach then would have helped, if the tinkering with the action was what caused the injury.", "\"But now,\" says Munaf, \"as Sekhar sir has advised, I am running in straight and going for full pace. I enjoy it, people watching also enjoy it. That pace is natural; that I won't lose. I can raise it whenever I want to.", "\"I feel bad that I have got injured twice in a short career,\" he says. \"It's worse to see the team do well from outside. The worst feeling was getting injured in South Africa. I played next to nothing. The wickets were such that I felt we could have won the series had I played.\"", "\"Rustic\" is a tag that gets naturally attached to Munaf. There is a somewhat patronising school of thought that says he is the sort that needs to be guided constantly, that his brittleness lies in his mind and not his body. One of the reasons for coaches and selectors to have developed such an opinion could be that Munaf has frustrated by showing promise and not being able to live up to it. Munaf thinks otherwise, though. \"They must have seen something to say that. But only I know what's happening in my back or my shoulder. That they can't see. If I am talking to you right now, how will you know if I have an internal injury?", "\"It has not helped that I have got injured twice in a year and a half. But before that, I have only got injured once in domestic cricket.\"", "Munaf seems to know his game better than people give him credit for. At MRF he can be seen correcting other bowlers, advising them. Pathan, who is also at MRF, looks for Munaf's approval of the way he is loading, going into his delivery stride. In fact, Munaf is referred to as \"coach\" at the academy. \"When he talks to them, he is also looking to learn something,\" Sekhar says. \"He is looking to improve himself whenever he sees other bowlers.\"", "Munaf has fulfilled his first short-term goal: to get fit and selected for the one-dayers in England. He is also reportedly close to signing for Worcestershire, where Zaheer Khan spent the last season and came back an improved bowler.", "The time of agony is over, and his first chance comes against the team who were at the receiving end when he made his debut at Mohali last year. With the other fast bowlers doing well in England and a few more looking to make comebacks, Munaf will hate to create vacancies again -- through injury most of all."], "tag": ["Sports"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=395", "location": " undated", "date": "2007-08-17"}

There is full-grown craze which originates in its proponents and then intoxicates people with wild frenzy. The liberation wars, revolutions, and popular upheavals come under this category. Then there is also craze which goes off at half-cock. It has the risk of people who laugh at their own jokes. The proponents, intoxicated by their own idea, don't wait to hear from other people.  ", "To cut to the chase, another ill-concocted craze may be in the offing. I say another because the country is yet to recover from the monumental failure of the caretaker system. Now who doesn't remember that once it was seen as the silver bullet for the ills of power transition? It was hyped up so much by those who believed in it that they didn't bother to find out if the people were also equally convinced.", "The new craze is the heightened interest in the National Security Council. It is being played as an essential for political reforms like no cake is complete without icing. The idea has been endorsed by many opinion leaders already, and more of them will find it politically expedient to rally around it. There is a temporary lull due to the flood, and it will bounce back into national discourse after the water recedes. ", "So, no dribbling and slam dunk: Why do we need a National Security Council? Well, there are some countries in the world, which have this executive branch governmental body. Perhaps that is one good reason why we should also have it. ", "The other reason is more obvious.

Not much details yet and all we know, it will have representations from politicians, bureaucrats, army, and prominent citizens of other professions. But what will it do and how far will it go? Let us say it will do more or less a cross-section of what it does in other countries. ", "But is it the right time to have the National Security Council? The main reason why the caretaker government has been installed is to renovate our wobbling political structure, and strengthen the institutions, which were falling apart. And the State of Emergency came like an anesthesia prior to surgical intervention.

In the US, where it originated, the institution has mostly remained under the fold of presidents. The council has gone through many fluctuations in its 60 years of age, remaining neglected by Truman, revived by Eisenhower, ignored by Kennedy, so forth and so on. The case against the sitting George Bush is that he has turned the National Security Council into a pocket organisation.", "The upshot is that the National Security Council is a risky proposition for the same reason it also looks attractive. It requires a mature statecraft to handle a sophisticated apparatus, which requires sophisticated handling. In so much as it has to come, and come that it will, given the twist of political irony, I can only plead that it should be further considered before implementation and implemented after adequate scrutiny.

", "But the point that I wish to make is that this narrative is only convincing if we start our calculations in 1954 and overlook the most consequential election ever held in this land, the election of 1946, in which, it can be argued, that the people (or at least one community) of the land that is now Bangladesh made a fateful choice, from which all sub-continental history since then flows.", "Following the 1946 elections, Bengal, where the Muslim League won 110 seats out of 117 reserved for Muslims, provided the only provincial League ministry, and it was both the support of Bengali Muslims for Pakistan as well as their political control of the province that eventually provided the foundation and impetus for partition and Pakistan.", "But one cannot be too hard on Bengali Muslims for their steadfast support for the Muslim League, and thus ultimately for Pakistan, throughout the 1940s.  As Mr. Islam points out in his superb piece printed opposite, the true watershed moment came in the aftermath of the 1936 elections when the Congress declined to form a coalition ministry with Fazlul Huq's KPP and independents, leaving the opening for the League to join forces with the non-aligned Muslim political power-houses in the region and to eventually dominate East Bengal politics.", "Thus, by the time 1946 came along, the Bengali Muslims were squarely in the League camp, and there were no other realistic options available.  How and why politicians of the acumen and calibre of Fazlul Huq and H.S. Suhrawardy permitted themselves to be played by Jinnah, who turned on them as soon they had served their purpose, and be used as his generals in the battle for the creation of a country that served neither their personal political interest nor that of their constituencies, is another question.", "How might history have unfolded differently?  One alternative to partition could have been a united federated Indian sub-continent along the lines laid out by the Cabinet Mission Plan of 1946, perhaps the most ingenious and comprehensive effort to accommodate both Muslim League and Congress demands prior to independence.  However, by 1947, this possibility or any similar one was long dead and buried.", "A second alternative would have been for a united Bengal to be incorporated into Pakistan, i.e. Pakistan without partition.  However, this possibility was scotched on June 20, 1947 in the Bengal Legislative Assembly, when members of the non-Muslim-majority areas of Bengal voted 58-21 for partition.  However, given the fact that the assembly as a whole had voted (more or less along communal lines) 126-90 for Pakistan, this is understandable.", "Finally, there was the possibility of a United Bengal, as proposed by H.S. Suhrawardy and Sarat Chandra Bose, which, though it had the support of other prominent Bengali Congress and League leaders such as Abul Hashim and Kiran Shankar Roy, was opposed by others, and was eventually snuffed out by the two parties' central leaderships.", "In the end, there was partition which split Bengal for good and led (for Bangladeshis) to 24 years of oppression.", "Partition is a difficult subject for Bangladeshis.  The conventions of patriotism seem to require that we never suggest that partition was a mistake and that the sub-continent would have been better off remaining in one piece, regardless of the fact that to any impartial observer this seems more or less self-evident. ", "The argument against partition is bolstered, in the Bangladeshi case, by the recognition that Pakistan, as originally conceived and created, was a travesty of a nation, built on  entirely flawed concepts.  But this recognition, interestingly, does not seem to translate into the corollary understanding that partition itself was a mistake.  It is as though to argue that partition was a mistake is to argue that Bangladesh should not exist, since without partition there would be no Bangladesh.", "But I don't see it that way.  It seems to me that there is no necessary contradiction in acknowledging that Pakistan was a fallacious concept to begin with and in being a patriotic Bangladeshi, even though Bangladesh exists as a sovereign nation only in the context of a reaction to the creation of the nation of Pakistan.", "So let me run the risk of having my patriotism questioned by stating that it seems to me incontestable that partition was a mistake.  ", "However, I would like to finish here by quoting eminent Indian columnist and editor, M.J. Akbar, who has written eloquently about the three partitions of the sub-continent.  We all know about the partition of 1947 and the partition (if you will) of 1971.  But, according to Akbar, it was the partition of 1965 which has had the most far reaching consequences and which is the one that we should aim to reverse.", "Prior to 1965, the borders between India and Pakistan were more or less open and goods and people traveled back and forth freely.  It was in the run-up to the 1965 war that the borders were permanently closed and have remained so ever since (even after 1971).  It is this partition that has kept the peoples of the three countries apart from one another and that has cleaved the sub-continent into three, and while we will forever remain three sovereign nations, it is this partition that it is in all of our powers and all of our interests to reverse.", "Indeed, going forward, there is no reason why we Bangladeshis cannot enjoy the best of all worlds.  There is no need to sacrifice our sovereignty and our national pride to avail ourselves of all the advantages of a united sub-continent.  ", "As geographic and demographic imperatives and inevitabilities become impossible to resist and we move closer and closer towards total regional integration and cooperation, we will gain the benefits of a united federated Indian sub-continent as envisaged by the Cabinet Mission Plan 60 years ago.", "But as an added bonus, Bangladeshis will, at the same time, be able to enjoy what no other sub-continental community -- neither the Sindhis nor the Tamils nor the Punjabis nor the Gujaratis nor even our Bengali brethren across the border -- can boast: our own nation, our own flag, our own cricket team -- in short, our sovereignty.", "All things considered, and against all the odds, perhaps it didn't work out so badly for us in the end, after all."], "tag": ["Editorial"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=318", "location": null, "date": "2007-08-17"}

It was a truly appropriate gesture, one that the Founder of the State surely deserves for his pivotal role in the creation of this free Bangladesh republic in 1971. Indeed, the presence of the head of state, head of government on the one hand and the chiefs of the army, navy and air force on the other at Bangabandhu's grave is evidence of a convergence of thoughts among them on the place of Bangabandhu in our national history. More significantly, the honour thus shown to Bangabandhu ought to be seen as a reflection of a long-felt national desire to see the country's founder placed on a proper pedestal.

Besides, it was largely confined to the capital. Such an absence of a demonstration of public sentiment, despite the signals going out from the top levels of the state, of course had to do with the fact that the country is currently under a state of emergency. But since the presence of such a high level team in Tungipara can be considered a sign of things to be, we will hope and expect that it will mark the building of a consensus around Bangabandhu's place in history and will be seen as a beginning to the shaping of a unified national response to the observance of his death anniversary as National Mourning Day."], "tag": ["Editorial"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=316", "location": null, "date": "2007-08-17"}

It is widely known in the bureaucracy that poorest DCs plunder the minimum of around Taka ten lakh annually. These corrupt bureaucrats are the root of all evils in the society. They taught the politicians to drive on the highway of corruption and sharing booty amongst themselves. These bureaucrats became  powerful because of being the custodian of all dark records of the politicians;  the bureaucrats even dictated their mass promotions to the rank of deputy secretary to end up in 1500-plus against a sanctioned post of around 800. These corrupts have grabbed the posts in autonomous organisations and are squatting these organisations, resulting in blocking the promotions of competent and dedicated officers of those government organisations.

The excess of deputy secretaries over the sanctioned posts should be retired immediately and autonomy of autonomous organisations be restored immediately. The government has done such forced retirements in 1960 and in 1969 after the change to curb corruptions.

The glaring example of rehabilitation of the proven corrupt accountant as executive director of Bangladesh Computer Council, for instance, is the ominous sign of the power of puppet masters.

If there is a market shortage, a logical action will happen: the price will push up until it reaches equilibrium.

I feel duty-bound to write this letter in view of the frightening condition of rail and road network in Bangladesh. A very recent incident jolted me to my bones. The bright day light was fading over the sky of Boston as my wife and I were leisurely sipping tea in our son's house at Braintree when the telephone blared and we got the news of the terrible bridge collapse in central Minneapolis in Minnesota. The eight-lane bridge was constructed only forty years ago over the mighty Mississippi river and over two hundred thousand   cars crossed the bridge every day. What was more dreadful was that my younger son used to take this route to commute to his office. The time the bridge collapsed ( 6pm) he should have been on the bridge on way back home but with a rare stroke of luck he flew to New Jersey that same morning on a vacationing trip. The twisted steel and huge concrete slabs with vehicles strewn in a rumpled mess as shown on the TV made us chill in horror. Whatever the authorities reported we presume the number of fatality would exceed twenty with umpteen wounded. ", "It is reported that simple routine repair work was going on two lanes. The real cause of such a major bridge collapse is still unknown and the FBI ruled out sabotage possibilities. My eyes, however, stuck on two revelatory items in the report of The Boston Globe. In 1997, Minnesota Department of Transportation cited problems with the approach spans on both ends of the bridge including 'cracks --- in the cross girder at the end of the approach spans'. In a 2001 report the department softly hinted on fatigue details on the main truss and the floor truss system but concluded saying that no fatigue cracking was expected in 'foreseeable' future and therefore the bridge did not require to be prematurely replaced involving high costs. Such impalpable and sketchy reports on vital issues are common in the developing countries but one cannot help wonder how such a slip-shod and blunt reporting could have been possible in a country like the United States. Undeniably, some structural glitch built up over years finally reached a critical mass to abruptly erupt in a hellfire to tear down the concrete Minneapolis edifice though the authorities were not absolutely unaware of the deteriorating process.

Millions of innocent people are using these bridges in good faith not knowing when and how the catastrophe will strike. A few years ago the much vaunted Rajdhani Express of the Indian Railway plunged into the river as the dilapidated bridge could no longer hold the thundering monster. Our age-old ramshackle Hardinge, Boral, Bhairab and numerous other rail and road bridges and culverts lie exposed to terrible mishaps. The authorities prefer to depend more on providence than reality while bridge management culture in our transportation sector continues to descend from bad to worse. Keeping the urgency of the situation in view, the government should prepare both long and short term plans to take up bridge maintenance and renovation issues on a priority basis in order to avert colossal human tragedies in future. Adequate funds have to be placed for the purpose and schemes firmly implemented. The eternal plea of budgetary constraints and bureaucratic failures cannot be a rational alternative to the loss of human life and property."], "tag": ["Letters"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=736", "location": " ", "date": "2007-08-20"}

Yet this news area is often neglected by reporters and editors who tend to concentrate on stories revolving around government, politics and other official institutions. Many journalists might secretly think that business and economics are boring, full of complicated terms and confusing numbers. Journalists can find a gold mine of good stories in business if they know where to look and how to use what they find. In addition, because these stories are so often overlooked, they provide a good way for weekly or small daily newspapers and other media outlets to beat the competition by presenting those stories first.", "Headline is important", "In many ways, a business and economic story is no different from any other. It must be accurate, thorough, well-researched, balanced and fair and contain multiple sources of information. In business stories, though, some forward looking statement, future prospects of an industry or a company, numbers and specific data are critically important. ", "A story about banking/multinational company's performance over a certain period can reveal a lot of information about foreign banks or the multinationals and their investment curve if the news is properly depicted. The trend of capital increase each year also discloses the company's long-term commitment, hence giving a message to the general readers or the potential investors about the future economic prospects of a country. Even taking views from important people like the regulators or the industry leaders can also make the news more informative and interesting and augment more private sector investment.", "A business reporter must never hesitate to ask questions about money and spending and to dig for the answers if they're not readily available. Another difference is the angle (approach) that a business reporter takes on a subject. For example, when writing about a new housing development subsidised by the government, the general assignment reporter may be primarily interested in how tenants for the apartments will be selected, how much they will pay in rent and about political and neighborhood support and opposition for the project. But the business reporter may also want to know which contractors have been awarded the construction bids for the project; how much each contract is worth; how many employees will be hired in the construction phase and then later to manage the project; where the capital (money) comes from to fund the project; and how that money will be repaid. Every story, of course, could contain all of these elements. It is the details about numbers and money that often are missing in media stories, and that's where the opportunity comes for those who are interested in pursuing the business angles and take lead.", "Reliable sources are essential", "A variety of knowledgeable sources are needed for almost all business stories. In most cases, reporters should start at the top and try to interview the key decision-makers. When writing about a company, for example, try to interview the top business executives. It's the top business people who can best describe the firm's business strategy and often they are the only ones who can release certain important information. Reporters who establish themselves as accurate, reliable and fair professionals can win the confidence of top business leaders and will get better stories because of it.", "The \u201cnumbers\u201d people in an organization  the chief accountant, chief financial officer or treasurer  are other invaluable resources because they can often help explain confusing budgets and other financial statements. In the interests of accuracy and thoroughness, they may be quite willing to cooperate. Business reporters must make every effort to meet and know business leaders in the community and to cultivate the contacts they make in the process of reporting stories. These sources can provide background, tips on developing news stories and perspective on business and economic trends.", "   The people and the corporate culture at organizations: Journalists sometimes think that they have no opportunity to write about people stories because it may not be directly linked to a business report. But doing so they often miss out the important fact that the people working for the company and the corporate culture, affects every business everywhere, and a company always banks on its talents to the same extent as it banks on its customers. Writing about people stories, innovations and trends in business and or corporate culture often tells you how ethically a company is running its business and may also prove invaluable to many readers.", "Business Stories", "Highlighting the booming or buoyant sectors in an economy is the key to strengthen the country's economy and facilitate growth. Business stories can come from anywhere, but an organised division of subject areas can help reporters and editors ensure that they're keeping an eye on the entire picture. For instance, if we consider. ", " Banking and finance: Banks often are the largest and sometimes the most influential institutions in a community. Readers and viewers should be kept informed about the status of these banks: writing about trends and changes in banking, finance and lending are of utmost interest to readers and viewers. Bankers, while required to maintain confidence about individual clients, can also be good sources of information about other events in the business community, since they usually have a wide circle of acquaintances and knowledge about the local situation.", "Retail: Every area has myriad retail businesses of all sizes and shapes. These basic businesses drive the local economy's engine. Their success or failure is always a story, and may also tell a lot about how the local economy and local residents are doing. Trend stories  those that focus on changes in strategy, types of retail businesses, competition or pricing issues  are the foundation of good retail reporting, especially when the reporter is the first to report on a new trend. ", "Hospitality and tourism: In developing countries or regions, tourism is often seen as a potential savior for the economy. Attracting paying visitors can indeed have a big payoff, in terms of attracting revenue, creating jobs and producing taxes. However, business reporters must look critically at such efforts. Merely announcing an effort to attract tourists or tout the advantages of local sites is not enough. These are just a few of the potential areas for local business stories. Others include agriculture, manufacturing, sports and advertising/media, to name just a few.", "Avoid the press release", "The good business reporter never has to learn about a news story from a press release or press conference. Instead, the reporter strives to be the first with the news, gleaned through regular contracts with a wide variety of sources in the business community. By the time a press release is issued or a press conference is held, the reporter is just one of a pack covering a story. In cases where the public announcement of a new venture or major change is the reporter's first clue about a news story, it is still essential to use multiple sources, to look for competitors and rivals and to look for the labor angle to provide a comprehensive, balanced story that goes well beyond the single-source story.", "Global Element to Business Stories ", "No matter where in the world you live and report, there are multinational corporations, government policies and international treaties that affect you, your community and your readers. The key is finding the information that brings a broader worldview to local business writing, and puts it in a global perspective. It is a mistake to assume that readers in a small city or rural place are not interested in, say, global trade or international agreements. They just need to understand why they care and what, exactly affect them in their daily lives. It is the job of the business writer to tell them, to figure out how to bring these policies, news and information home to the local level and make it understandable to all levels of readers. There are a number of resources and Web sites at your fingertips to help you find a global angle, and this backgrounder is designed to help you find them. ", "It might be business, but it's still journalism", "Being an economics reporter means being a good writer, a good communicator, not just someone who is knowledgeable about the subject matter. So if you want to do what you're doing better, don't spend all your spare time studying heavy economics textbooks - read a good novel instead. Being a good communicator also means we have to be expert journalists, not experts in finance or economics. And we have to keep doing what all journalists do, expertly judging things with the same instincts - Is it new? Is it big? Is it different? Is it interesting? Is it entertaining, even? And why does it matter?", "And we should approach the information we are given with the same caution and concern: Where did it come from? Does the source of the information have an interest in seeing the story presented in a particular way? Who else can I talk to so that I can confirm that the information is accurate, fair and balanced? Have I spoken to everyone involved in the story, or at least enough people to get a fair cross-section of opinion? Have I asked experts (since I am not the expert) what they think about it? Have I got some good quotes? What is my lead going to be?", "Creating the wow factor: An economic reporter should always think of creating a `wow' factor in his piece that will lead to an information bank for the readers. You might have been given some information to start with, but you build the rest of it yourself. You begin by asking yourself - or your news editor or colleagues  all the questions you can think of that might make the story better, more interesting and easier to understand for your readers. And if there is something you don't understand, don't just put it in your story and hope for the best.

{"reporter": "The Times", "headline": [], "lastModified": null, "newsBody": ["There's a nice story told by Jurgen Klinsmann about the man who turned out to be his successor as head coach of Germany. Klinsmann had been sizing up Joachim Low's potential as his assistant ahead of the 2006 World Cup, and was swung not by his snappy dress sense  Low likes clothes  but by a vivid explanation of how a flat back-four should move, relative to one another.", " \u201cYou know,\u201d said Klinsmann, \u201cI was a professional for 18 years, and in those 18 years no coach could ever explain that to me. And in one minute he made me understand how it works.\u201d And so they sailed on together, the blond with his steely blue eyes in the foreground, the mildly dashing, dark-haired Low behind him. All the way to a World Cup semi-final, sweeping away a decade of gathering pessimism around Germany's national game, becoming affectionately known as \u201cKlinsi\u201d and \u201cJogi\u201d to their admirers.", " \u201cI'm not your boss, we're together on board the ship,\u201d Klinsi told Jogi at the beginning of the World Cup adventure. And when Klinsi disembarked at the end of it, to return to his life in California, Jogi had gained sufficient profile to become the leading candidate for the job of chief coach. Low is 47 and had a hopscotch coaching career before Klinsmann took him on. A German Under21 international striker as a player, he started well in Bundesliga management, guiding Stuttgart to a Cup-Winners' Cup final  they lost to Chelsea in 1998  and then became a bit of a voyager, with clubs in Turkey and Austria.", "None of which compares for success with his first 12 months in charge of Germany, whom he brings to Wembley as the most impressively placed of all the teams in qualifying for Euro 2008.", "Nor are Jogi's Germany merely a replica of Klinsi's. They have some of the same spirit, the desire for swift, even swashbuckling football, but Low has been discovering that his resources may be deeper than suspected even during the World Cup.", "Wembley, being a friendly, will not truly find them out even if England have a strong night there, although the squad Low brings have been made aware that the venue obliges the Germans to make of the night something special. Announcing his party for the trip to London, Low was flanked by German players of various eras including Uwe Seeler and Paul Breitner, and their audience was given a show of England-Germany meetings at Wembley through history. The last of those was in 2000, when Kevin Keegan resigned as England manager, Didi Hamann scored the only goal and Rudi Voller had L\u00f6w's job. None of the players who started for the winning team that afternoon will be in Low's XI on Wednesday. Only Michael Ballack might have acted as a link, but the Chelsea midfielder is unavailable. So are Torsten Frings and Tim Borowski, which leaves Low seeking a new centre to his team.", "There are likely to be one or two debutants. The two Stuttgart players, Serdar Tasci and Sami Khedira, both 20, were added to the squad, with Low saying he would \u201clike to learn more about them\u201d. The group contains four Bayern Munich players and four from Stuttgart, dividend of that club's status as German champions  they won the league on its final afternoon  and a Bundesliga title achieved on the back of a fine youth development system. A hero of Stuttgart's gripping title pursuit, Thomas Hitzlsperger, is also included. Not too long ago he was deemed not good enough for the Aston Villa first-team.", "At Wembley, Hitzlsperger may be put in charge of Germany's midfield. In a young squad, Jens Lehmann looks conspicuously the senior man. The Arsenal goalkeeper may yet have a long journey to go with Low, however; the coach has expressed concern that his other keeper, Timo Hildebrand, has moved from Stuttgart to a club, Valencia, where he could start the season as second choice.", "Klinsmann's reign was distinguished by his readiness to promote quickly, but if Low has willingly gathered that baton, it is not with the expected personnel. None of the starlets of Germany 2006, such as full-back Philipp Lahm, striker Lucas Podolski and the wide players Bastian Schweinsteiger and David Odonkor, had brilliant domestic seasons after the tournament. Low may be more unhappy about the absence of Mario Gomez, the young Stuttgart forward and Bundesliga player of the year.", " \u201cIt's a bit of a strain on us,\u201d said Low of the half-dozen injuries, \u201cbut we are not going to complain.\u201d"], "tag": ["Sports"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=744", "location": null, "date": "2007-08-20"}

The teams could provide a list of their preferred methods of assisting the ball to swing and then the ICC would decide on the one to be legalised.", "Ever since Adam Gilchrist hit the Test arena and international bowlers like a tornado, other teams have been trying to replicate his style of middle-order mayhem. England in particular have eschewed picking the best wicketkeepers in an attempt to get more runs from the lower order, and in doing so the selectors have ignored a couple of important factors.", "Firstly, Gilchrist was always a wicketkeeper who just happened to also be a very destructive batsman. Secondly, an average of 40 runs from the wicketkeeper doesn't compensate for dropping catches off players of the calibre of Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman.", "The excuse that Matthew Prior, like everyone else, is entitled to a bad game overlooks a basic flaw in his game: his footwork is negligible and the practice drills he uses don't address this issue, making it highly unlikely there'll be any great improvement in his glove work. Once a keeper starts to cost a team in the field he should lose his Test place, and Prior has reached that point.", "If England played four bowlers and used Paul Collingwood, Michael Vaughan and Kevin Pietersen to occasionally rest them they could bat Andrew Flintoff at No. 7 and then lower-order runs wouldn't be an issue. Good selection is about getting the right combination and England won't unearth that team while they continue to play poor wicketkeepers.", "India did well to beat England 1-0, however they could easily have won the Oval Test if they'd enforced the follow-on. India were without a head coach on the tour but there was no shortage of advisors when it came time for the captain to decide on the follow-on. Captaincy by committee never works, because the responsibility for a poor decision falls squarely on the skipper's shoulders anyway.", "The only question Rahul Dravid needed to ask at The Oval was: \"Any injuries among the bowlers?\" If there were no injuries then he should have enforced the follow-on, especially if he'd left the decision to the moment the tenth English first-innings wicket fell. By then it would have been obvious the overcast conditions favoured bowling. If England had followed-on, the game would have been all but over by the fourth evening.", "However, being captain of India isn't as straightforward as leading, say, Australia. If Ricky Ponting makes a poor judgment, as he did during the 2005 Ashes series, his effigy isn't burned in the streets or his family threatened. This is why an Australian captain is able to challenge his team to become better, which gives him a considerable advantage over his Indian counterpart.", "By the time the two teams meet in Australia later this year, India will have appointed a new coach, meaning there'll be an extra advisor adding to the long list already in Dravid's ear. This will make India's job of trying to beat Australia at home even more difficult -- an extremely unpalatable thought for such a demanding cricket nation."], "tag": ["Sports"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=781", "location": null, "date": "2007-08-20"}

The overnight wait didn't disrupt their momentum as Paul Collingwood and Liam Plunkett ran through Hampshire's lower order, the last five wickets falling for 13 runs after rain had delayed the resumption until 12.30 on Sunday.", "Plunkett, who improved vastly from his bowling on Saturday, secured the trophy by bowling Shane Warne. The only disappointment was that there was only a smattering of spectators in the ground to witness Durham's historic moment. The slightly extended wait won't dampen the celebration, except perhaps for Paul Collingwood who has to join up with England's one-day squad in Southampton. The hard work was done on Saturday after the batsmen piled up 312, a record for a domestic 50-over final, and Otis Gibson stunned Hampshire's top order.", "Earlier this season Gibson claimed all 10 wickets in an innings against Hampshire in the Championship and with the first ball of the run chase he had Michael Lumb superbly caught by Michael Di Venuto at second slip. Sean Ervine, who starred with a century in Hampshire's 2005 C&G success, fell in nearly identical fashion next ball. However, Ervine stood his ground before the decision was confirmed by the third umpire. There was no doubt that the ball carried.", "This match was the last in which the referral system was in operation. Phil Mustard, the Durham wicketkeeper, forgot it was available when he was given out lbw to James Bruce, only realising two thirds of the way to the pavilion that he had the option. The rules said the referral had to be made immediately and Mustard had missed his chance.", "In the field, though, Durham used the system when Kevin Pietersen hit a drive back towards Gibson, who was convinced he'd got a finger on the ball as it crashed into the non-striker's stumps with John Crawley well out of his ground. Benkenstein asked for it to be referred but, as was often the case, pictures were inconclusive and Crawley survived.", "Any hopes Hampshire had of that changing their fortune quickly vanished when Pietersen was trapped plumb in front by a ball from Gibson that didn't bounce, leaving the chase in tatters at 17 for 3. Crawley tried his best to hold the innings together with 68, but when he was removed by Collingwood, Durham had the trophy.", "Hampshire were disappointing. ", "Apart from Daren Powell -- who registered 92mph on the speed gun -- the six-man attack struggled for consistency, with even below his best. Before Mustard was sent on his way, he had laid an aggressive platform, showing the strokeplay that has got people taking about another candidate for England's wicketkeeper spot. Chanderpaul and Coetzer -- a West Indian and a Scotsman -- added 111 in 119 balls to put Durham on course for 300-plus.", "Chanderpaul reprised the form that brought him 446 runs in the Test series and 202 in the three ODIs against England. He took on all the bowlers, getting the ball rolling against Bruce before stepping across to Chris Tremlett and clipping a full delivery effortlessly over square leg for six. Similar punishment followed for Ervine as Chanderpaul swept him into the stands and West Indies teammate Powell was taken for three fours in an over.", "Coetzer, who had come into a rich vein of form recently, ensured Durham built on a positive opening stand. He had opted for county over country -- he could have been playing for Scotland in the recent match against India -- and a new contract won't be far away after his well-paced 61. His front-foot driving was especially impressive and when he pulled Ervine into the Grandstand the innings was about to find another gear, but two balls later a loose drive was plucked out by Warne at extra cover.", "Chanderpaul had a century in his sights before begin sent back by Collingwood while looking for a second run. However, with such a strong platform Durham could afford to cut loose. Collingwood struggled for his timing but Benkenstein middled everything from the start of his 43-ball 61 and sent the final three balls of the innings for 6,4,4 as 34 came off the last two overs. The end of their innings and the start of Hampshire's sealed the result and although they were held up by the English summer, nothing could deny Durham their triumph.

He's still the much-admired leader of Jatiya Party, and the people of his constituency still honour him with a rousing welcome. Indeed, they seem ready to elect him in a national election any time. While reconciling people's support in his constituency is explicable by calling them ignorant and under-educated, what virtues can anyone attach to the so-called educated politicians who still follow his trail?

Praying for Allah's mercy and help for the people is fine, but why would Allah favour the party of corrupt leaders over AL or JP, whose culpabilities are much less by any stretch of comparison?

Around 80% of India's working population is in this sector. Nearly 80% of this group earns less than Rs 20 a day and 85% of this sub-group is trapped in debt.

This encourages the illusion that 77% of India is now above the poverty line. It isn't that much above in any case.  Nor is this poverty line index-linked to inflation. Twelve rupees a day buys much less today than it did three years ago. The traditional poverty groups remain where they were: 88% of Scheduled Tribes and Castes, 80% of \"Other Backward Classes,\" and 85% of Muslims belong to the \"poor and vulnerable\" class.", "If these statistics are lies the government should disown them, sack the author of the report, and produce alternative figures that indicate a different scenario. Dr. Manmohan Singh cannot hide from facts by taking shelter behind silence.", "Instead of concentrating on poverty, Dr. Singh concentrated on George Bush.  Heads of government who have invested in Bush at the expense of their national interest are on a losing streak this year. Tony Blair has disappeared into insignificance so quickly that his decade in office already seems like a mirage. Any good he might have done for his country has been lost in that colossal and unthinking blunder called Iraq. John Howard, the other great Bush ally, is heading for defeat in this year's Australian elections.", "Dr. Singh always misunderstood the nature of the debate on the nuclear deal.  That political fault-line has now extended to the parties in his alliance, who did not have much to do with the decision but surrendered (unlike the Left) their independent judgment in order to hang on to office. Lalu Yadav, Sharad Pawar, and M. Karunanidhi will be answerable to voters for a decision that they rubber-stamped without examining the consequences. ", "For some reason that one has been unable to fathom, Dr. Singh once called protests against the Bush visit to India \"communal.\" If he thought that only Muslims were suspicious of his eagerness to accept any terms imposed by the Bush administration then I presume he has changed his views now. Any investment on such a scale, in both financial and strategic terms, cannot be pushed through by merely the will of a government. It has to be sifted through the process of national debate, particularly in Parliament. If the American legislature has the right to interfere in decision-making, and impose qualifications, why not the Indian legislature?

It was only a few of us Bangladeshi women, who fought to hold on to it.", "Due to my role in convincing the then government to allow us to keep the property, I was chosen to be the president of the club in June 1973. At that time, there was a large empty hall, with neither electricity nor water supply. The staff consisted of an old man, a dog, and a 'disabled' man who worked as a sweeper. The club had only 12 members.", " How did you go about building it up from such a sorry state?", " The first hurdle was attracting new members. The Ladies Club didn't have a very good reputation then, so not many people came forward to join. The 12 of us started convincing our friends, relatives, and neighbours. Then we started a singing and dancing school, in the hope that parents bringing their children for lessons would be impressed by the club and join. Next, we launched sewing lessons, and got a lot of women to join this way.", "After all our efforts, today, we have over 600 members.", " With so few members at the outset, the club must have struggled financially?", " Of course, it was a big problem. We did not receive any help from any outside sources, so we had to raise funds ourselves. We held a series of fairs, which were a huge success, and brought us enough revenue to construct the library building in 1976.", "Over the past decade, our hall has become an increasingly popular place to rent for weddings and other social functions, and the earning from there has made us totally self-sufficient. In 2003, we built a new 2-storey building on the same property using our own funds.", " With all these changes, have the club's aims and functions evolved as well?", " The Ladies Club was started to provide a safe place for female recreation, and that remains our main objective. Club means recreation centre. Women come here to take a break from their hectic jobs or household chores--to eat, relax, read, chat, and to play mahjong, cards, carom or ludo. It is a haven for them, a place of rest, enjoyment, and peace.", "Many women want to expand their knowledge, but may not find the time or environment to do so at home, where there are many distractions and disruptions. The library was built, because along with recreation, the club wants to provide all women with the environment and materials to study and learn, if they should so choose.", "The Ladies Club also organises many cultural functions, and we celebrate all the national holidays. We are particularly known for the rich and delicious food we prepare on special occasions like pohela boishakh.", "The club's facilities and cultural programmes are reserved for members, but does it have any kind of involvement in the wider society?", " Of course, our social work is equally important as our recreational facilities. Since 1985, we are running our Kushum Koli schools for slum children. We have 9 schools in 6 different areas in the city, where poor children can study free of cost from Playgroup to Class 5. The textbooks are according to National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) curriculum, but there is also religious teaching in every school. Alongside reading, writing and maths, the students also learn how to pray and read the Holy Qu'ran.", "Till date, 49 of the children from our schools have gone on to complete high school, and the club bore their academic expenses all the way through. We have a Zakat Fund, where all members donate a small portion of their zakat givings, and we use those funds to buy school uniforms, sweaters, and schoolbags for the children. We think of them as our own kids, and want them to have a better lifestyle. Every month we give each student a soap to use. We buy them mosquito nets so they are less likely to contract disease, and in winter we give them blankets so they stay warm.", "The club spends about Tk.7 lakh a year on these schools and the children. We ourselves take very little from club funds; even the food we eat here, we members pay for personally.", " What are your plans and expectations for the future?", " We hope to continue adding to our offerings here at the club, and improve our facilities further.

This, in turn, brought about the political turmoil and volatile situation that we see now.", "1971 united the whole nation (except a few collaborators of the Pakistani army) with the spirit of the Liberation War. People of all walks of life became freedom fighters in one way or another. Some actively joined the war, and millions, though they did not directly take part in the war, gave moral support to our war of independence. These people were, in fact, silent freedom fighters, among whom many sacrificed their lives, wealth, and efforts for the great cause.", "In essence, we may claim that the emergence of Bangladesh was possible due to the collective efforts of the people of the soil. So, naturally, after liberation these collective efforts should have made Bangladesh a prosperous country, as envisioned by many following the spirit of the liberation war. Ironically, Bangladesh has failed miserably to achieve the very objective of liberation.", "To unveil the causes behind this failure, we need to shed light on August 15, 1975, the blackest day in our national history. August 15, 1975, can be marked as a turning point for our country, from the light to the darkfrom hope to despair. On this day, with the brutal killing of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib, the monumental icon of independence and founding father of Bangladesh, the nation had to bury the spirit of the liberation war. So, in independent Bangladesh in 1975, the freedom fighters were defeated and the enemies of the liberation war, the collaborators with the Pakistani army, won, reversing history by implementing their well designed conspiracy.", "Customarily, the history of a country is written by the victors. For instance, British historians, during the reign of the British Raj, assailed the character of Nawab Sirajuddoula of Bengal. Nawab Sirajuddoula, as a Nawab of independent Bengal in 1756, fought against the East India Company, the forerunner of the British regime. The unfortunate defeat of Sirajuddoula, and the victory of Robert Clive, led the British regime to write the biased history demeaning Sirajuddoula and his associates.", "Similarly, the victors of 1975, who were the defeated forces of 1971, deliberately distorted  history, especially that of our Liberation War. In fact, the enemies of our country, the collaborators, are very shrewd. So, after the fall of the patriotic freedom fighters in 1975, they started to fabricate the history of Liberation in their own ways. Indeed, they were aware of the implications of the history and its long time impact on the nation. They knew that the revelation of the true history of our Liberation War would put them in the dustbin, and that they would never  be able to come to power.", "The distortion of history had been initiated during the post-Mujib era, especially in the textbooks of schools and colleges.

This turned out to be true in the later phases.", "The new generations have learned the biased history fabricated by the victors of 1975. This history has not revealed the whole truth; rather it has created smokescreens surrounding 1971, the glorious event of the Bengali nation.", "For instance, in our history textbook in school, we read that the freedom fighters had fought against occupying forces in 1971, but who the occupying forces were is not mentioned. The role of Sheikh Mujib in the Liberation War is limited to only two or three sentences. Rather, the role of the late president General Ziaur Rahman (then major in the Pakistan army) has been overemphasised, depicting him as the key organiser of our war of independence.", "This overemphasis was to such an extent that one may think that if Zia had not read the proclamation of our independence, the emergence of Bangladesh would not have been possible. Shamelessly, our history text deleted the fact that Ziaur Rahman announced the said proclamation on behalf of Sheikh Mujib. (If Ziaur Rahman were alive then he would have felt ashamed seeing this fabrication of history!)", "Again, the history books do not reveal the roles of Jamaat-i-Islami and its infamous leaders like Golam Azam, Motiur Rahman Nizami, and Ali Ahsan Mujahid, who collaborated with the Pakistani army in 1971. We have not learned about the role of the former president General Ershad during our Ali al-Mujahid. He was the chairman of a special tribunal in the Lahore cantonment, which tried Bengali soldiers who tried to flee to India with a view to participating in our war of independence. Had the true roles of the above mentioned heinous people during our Liberation War been reflected in the history books, then they certainly would not have been able to come to  power.", "Our history courses had utterly failed to teach us the background and the spirit of the Liberation War. This history does not indicate that the war of independence was, in fact, a continuous struggle from 1952 to 1971, and has not focused on the historical 6 points or 11 points demands, which can be regarded as the charters of independence. The fabricated history does not address the Agartala Conspiracy Case against Sheikh Mujib which, in turn, transformed him into Bangabandhu. It does not indicate the significance of Bangabandhu's speech of March 7, which can be compared with the Gettysburg Address delivered by Abraham Lincoln, the great American leader.", "Nationalism, secularism, and socialism, were the major ideas of our Liberation War. Abandoning the much hated \"two nation theory\" in 1971, the people of this land embraced Bengali nationalism and secularism as basic mantras for our salvation.

Perhaps due to this confused state, the people from the younger generations voted for and elected (as the lion share of the voters are from these generations) the identified collaborators of 1971 as members of the Parliament. For the same reason, people did not raise their voices much when war criminals like Nizami or Mujahid emerged as ministers in the last alliance government.", "The change-over in 1/11, and the statements of the army chief General M. U. Ahmed have given a ray of hope to the conscious citizens of the country.

It seem to be keener on mediation than on unearthing the truth.", "The government recognises Mujib as the Father of the Nation and Zia as the declarer of independence on Mujib's behalf. This is good. Mujib was the undisputed leader of our independence and deserves this appellation, regardless of anybody's recognition. And Zia read out the declaration note on behalf of Mujib on March 27, 1971.", "This is surely based on hard fact, but the question is how far this reading out of the declaration note of March 27 could be considered as the formal declaration of the independence of Bangladesh, which was virtually made on March 26, 1971. History should be treated dispassionately, with cool and clinical impersonality.  It does not bother about negotiations. So the facts about the declaration of our independence should be taken into consideration by the government.", "It is Mujib and only Mujib who, for the first time, formally made the declaration of the independence of Bangladesh on March 26, 1971.

Thousands of people killed. Fierce fighting going on. Appeal to the world for help in freedom struggle. Resist by all means. May Allah be with you. Joy Bangla.\"", "This message from Bangabandhu was then taken as the declaration of independence, which was read out by M.A. Hannan, general secretary of district (Chittagong) Awami League at 2:30 p.m. On this basis, March 26 was declared Independence Day.", "The declaration of independence made by Major Zia took place on the following day (March 27,1971). As a matter of fact, Zia made two speeches. In the first speech, he claimed himself as the president of Bangladesh and urged upon the people to fight the Pakistan army.", "When this unauthorised speech created confusion among the people, the Awami League leaders asked Zia to read out a text prepared by A. K. Khan to nullify the effect of the speech he had previously made.", "Zia followed the suggestion and made a second speech, where he categorically mentioned that he was speaking on behalf of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the great national leader.", "Zia's speech, however, had an electrifying effect among the fighting men and the civil population. But it was more to the credit of an ex-officio person than to the credit of Zia, the very person. In other words, it was a demand of the situation.", "Had there been some other army official, a major or a colonel or the like, the effect would have been the same. Moreover, March 27 has not been declared Independence Day on the basis of Zia's declaration.", "So, Zia should not be said to have declared independence of Bangladesh. He only read out the message of declaration on behalf of Mujib, which, too, has an historic significance that was duly recognised by the Mujibnagar government.", "In addition, the constitution, which was accepted as the \"Declaration of Independence\" on April 10, 1971, by 403 elected MPAs and MNAs also bears the testimony to the declaration of independence by Bangabandhu.", "Under that constitution was formed the first government of independent Bangladesh (Mujibnagar Government) with Mujib as the first president.", "The constitution of 1972 was later written in the light of that constitution.

A nation can't march forward on a democratic path without these ideological subjects.", "For giving birth to a nation, there is a need for a national leader or leadership to construct what famous Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci calls the \"headquarters\" of a movement. Nations or people become capable of meaningful and effective political action only when they are organised. They become a people or \"historical subjects\" only when they are organised as such.", "The leaders of the Awami League laid the foundation of the \"headquarters\" of the subsequent movements during the fifties. In the sixties, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman came to the forefront of the leadership, especially after the death of Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy in 1963.", "The subjugation, repression, and economic deprivation meted out to the Bengalis by the Pakistani rulers brought them under a single banner of Bengali nationhood. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who had emerged as an unparalleled leader, acted as a catalyst in consolidating this nationalism. The historic 6-point demand was not only a charter for leading the country towards independence but was also a testimony to Bengali nationalism.", "Through various movements and struggles, Mujib guided the nation towards the independence struggle. Bangladesh was born as an independent country after 9 months of bloody war under his leadership in 1971, although he was in a Pakistani jail.", "We got an independent Bangladesh, but the process of formation of the nation based on Bengali nationalism, which was in its infancy during the 50s and 60s, still continued.", "In fact, it takes a long time to consolidate nationhood. India had entered the process of becoming a nation in the late 19th century, and the process continued for several decades after independence in 1947.", "Finally, India now stands on a solid foundation of Indian nationhood through unifying its people, taking into account regional, religious, caste, ethnic and linguistic differences.", "But the process of becoming a nation or a \"people\" stopped suddenly after the assassination of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1975. The nation-in-the-making process would have been consolidated but, instead, it had not only been stopped but was counteracted through another formula of Bangladeshi nationalism conceived by a journalist-turned minister of Ziaur Rahman's cabinet.", "And the seed of disunity was thereby implanted in the very core of a nation. The poison-tree that was sown in the late 70s still continues to pour venom and manages to keep the country divided.", "As I have already mentioned, in reference to leadership for carrying out a movement, especially a national movement, we find that the countries, which are born through war or mass struggle must have a national hero. In other words, the birth of a nation is closely linked to a national leader.", "We can cite here the examples of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi of India, Mohammad Ali Jinnah of Pakistan, Kamal Pasha of Turkey, Gamal Abdul Naser of Egypt, Sukarno of Indonesia, Nelson Mandela of South Africa, Mao Tse Tung of China, and so on.", "All these leaders, who had played the leading role in carrying out movements in their respective countries, are respected and revered by their fellow countrymen and leaders. There might have been controversies centring them but, for the sake of national unity, the countrymen kept the heroes above all debates.", "A pearl is formed around a tiny particle. Without the particle, apparently having no face value, formation of this precious gem is not possible. Similarly, a nation can't be formed without a particle -- a national hero. And you can't create a hero at your whim.", "Heroes are created through struggles. Bangabandhu became a national hero through leading the nation into the independence struggle and freeing the country from Pakistani occupation. But we have failed to give him due recognition. We killed him.", "Like Bangabandhu, Gandhi was also assassinated. But the Indians never forgot their national hero, and keep him above all controversy. They did it because the Indian leaders understood that they needed a hero who could keep the nation united.", "They told the people that, despite his limitations as a human being, they must get united under the umbrella of a national leader like Gandhi.", "And what did we do? We not only killed Bangabandhu, we also assassinated his character. We tried to replace him by others. We destroyed his all achievements. Despite readymade references available in front of us, our rulers intentionally discarded those and tried to infuse their own theories to make a new nationhood and national hero.", "And what was the fallout? The country's people are still divided. To us self-interest is the best interest; individual is greater than party; party is greater than country.

And yet it is something more, something of values that you associate with any remembrance of him.", "He embodied some of the finest traditions that self-respecting people anywhere have, throughout the course of history, upheld in their lives. And among those values is the refusal to compromise, to undermine yourself through a convenient jettisoning of the ideals that you have always held dear.", "Even as the round table conference went on in Rawalpindi in 1969, President Ayub Khan suggested to Mujib that he take charge as Pakistan's prime minister. The Bengali leader spurned the offer. It was a natural gesture on the part of a man who had defied the winds and the trends of the times to come forth with the Six Points in 1966. It was Bengal that mattered to him. Nothing else did, or would.", "It was all in character for Bangabandhu. He never flinched from doing or saying anything he thought was right, or made good sense. In December 1969, as Bengalis remembered Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy on his death anniversary, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman let them, and by extension the world outside their own parameters, know that thenceforth East Pakistan would be known as Bangladesh. One hardly needed proof that Mujib had come a long way.", "Back in 1957, he had caused not a little distress to Suhrawardy, then Pakistan's prime minister, by asking him bluntly if Bengalis could not opt out of the state Jinnah had cobbled into shape. Suhrawardy reprimanded him for entertaining such thoughts. Mujib then simply bided his time. When it came, he knew the task he needed to perform. His dedication to the causes he espoused was complete and without ambiguity. His disillusionment with Pakistan having taken a firm shape by the early 1960s, he knew which path he needed to take. And he took it resolutely. There was little room in him for second thoughts.", "Bangabandhu was the troubadour who moved through the hamlets and villages of Bengal, disseminating the message that freedom from colonial rule and emancipation from economic exploitation were of the essence. Go into the remote regions of the country and you will chance upon men who still recall their \"Muzibor\" and everything he stood for. And what he stood for came alive assertively in 1971, when seventy five million Bengalis prayed for him even as he languished in solitary confinement in Pakistan.", "All politics, all religion, in that year of tragedy and decision focused on Bangabandhu. An entire war of national liberation was shaped and waged in his name. It was no mean feat, one that Fidel Castro remarked on when he met Bangladesh's founder at the Algiers Non-Aligned summit in 1973. That Bangabandhu was a tall man, and not just in the literal sense, was what delighted Castro. And it subdued other men, like Nigeria's Yakubu Gowon. A hostile King Faisal of Saudi Arabia was quickly shocked into silence by the courage of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Faisal, a man without vision, could not understand why the Bengalis had driven Pakistan out of their lives. Mujib then lectured him soundly on what Islam signified, and how the Pakistanis had distorted the faith.", "Principles, then, were what served as Mujib's fundamental political premise. When Zulfikar Ali Bhutto came calling in January 1971, clearly to ask for a share of power with the majority Awami League, Bangabandhu made it clear that Bhutto's People's Party needed to be where the electoral judgement had placed it, in parliamentary opposition. It was a position he would maintain in the tumultuous season of March 1971, despite the growing pressure on him to relent. The Six Points could not be trifled with. And when the Pakistan army tried to shoot them down, he went for a single point: he declared the nation's independence before being seized by the army.", "There was always prescience in Mujib's pronouncements. He calmly told a western journalist at the height of the Agartala conspiracy case trial in 1968: \"You know, they can't keep me here for more than six months.\" In the event, he was a free man in the seventh month. Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s he went on reassuring Bengalis that freedom would come into their lives. And it did. He prepared for freedom in the way only a man believing in constitutional politics would. He was not a revolutionary, which was why he was not willing to go for a direct confrontation with the Pakistan government. Neither was he an adventurist, for which reason he warded off all calls for a unilateral declaration of independence on March 7, 1971.", "And yet the oratory of that day remains part of history, of the Bengali psyche, for everything it pointed to, for the clear set of guidelines he left for his people to follow in the event of his absence from the political scene. It was these guidelines that Bengalis worked on for nine months. His words, his image, his idealism, all of these served as a metaphor for the armed struggle for freedom.", "By the time the state of Pakistan took flight from Bangladesh on December16, 1971, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had evolved further, into a liberator in the mould of Simon Bolivar, in the mould of everyone who had ever traversed a path to collective freedom.", "On a January day in 1972, as he spoke to the world on his arrival in London from Pakistani incarceration, he knew he had turned into an embodiment of history. He spoke of the joy of freedom inherent in the epic liberation struggle that the 1971 war had been.", "Humility and basic decency defined Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He never forgot names and always remembered faces, even those he had come across in his youth. He surprised the Indian journalist Nikhil Chakravartty when the latter turned up at Bangabandhu's news conference in late January 1972, in Dhaka. The two men had not met since 1946, and Chakravartty certainly did not expect Mujib to remember him. He was mistaken. As Bangabandhu entered the room, his gaze fell on the journalist. Then came the question, \"Aren't you Nikhil?\"", "The rest hardly needs to be recounted. Bangabandhu remembered the names of simple men, of peasants and labourers, inasmuch as he recalled the names of unknown political workers. It was a trait that endeared him to millions, who then spotted in him a guiding spirit who would light their way out of the dark woods. His respect for academics was beyond question, as men like Professor Muzaffar Ahmed Chowdhury, Professor Abdur Razzaque, Dr. A.R. Mallick and Dr. Abdul Matin Chowdhury would know.", "Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was a natural. He laughed uproariously, and deeply. Anecdotes made him double over with laughter. He himself was a purveyor of tales garnered through his travels all across Bengal. A sense of humour, undiminished despite the long years in prison, marked him out from other politicians. When Abdus Samad Achakzai remarked, on meeting him in 1970, that Ayub Khan had turned him into an old man, he riposted: \"Ayub Khan ne tum ko bhi buddha bana diya hum ko bhi buddha bana diya\" (Ayub Khan has made you an old man and has made me an old man as well). Welcoming Bangabandhu to his country in 1974, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al Nahiyan of the United Arab Emirates noted that, like him, Mujib was a sheikh. \"But there is a difference,\" said Bangladesh's leader. \"I am a poor sheikh.\" Both men burst into laughter.", "And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the story of a man who scaled the heights of greatness and yet did not lose touch with the dew on the grass.

The day should serve as a moment for the nation to go into serious soul-searching about the tragedy and the terrible ramifications it has had on national politics since August 15, 1975. The time has surely arrived when as a society we need to have our perspective on the tragedy set in clear outline as a way of moving on. And that is a job that can be done through taking steps toward officially declaring August 15 as National Mourning Day. We would like to take this opportunity to point out here that The Daily Star has since 1993 editorially been demanding that August 15 be declared as National Mourning Day.", "One hardly needs to reiterate the thought that the tragic happenings of August 1975 remain a dark spot on the history of this nation, particularly because of the clear absence of justice that was noted with regard to the murders under successive governments. It is a matter of grave embarrassment that Bangabandhu's assassins were given protection through an infamous indemnity ordinance that was again incorporated as law through the fifth amendment to the constitution. What remains galling for the nation is that most of the assassins were subsequently sent off to Bangladesh's diplomatic missions abroad in various capacities. At a later stage, some of the killers were even permitted to set up a political party and take part in the 1988 presidential election. Such episodes only went towards further undermining our national self-esteem, a phase that came to an end only when an Awami League government initiated the process of a trial of Bangabandhu's murderers through a repeal of the indemnity ordinance in 1996. We hope that the wheels of justice will turn fully and that the shame perpetrated in August 1975 will never be repeated.", "Today, as we recall the contributions of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to our history and the pivotal role he played in the shaping of our destiny, we ask the powers that be that August 15 be officially declared National Mourning Day as a mark of respect to the great man. We are happy to observe that steps have been taken to correct the history of Bangladesh's struggle for freedom in school textbooks. It is a move that will surely go a long way toward removing the falsehoods that have distorted our history since August 1975. We understand that the President, the Chief Adviser and the chiefs of the army, navy and air force will visit Bangabandhu's grave in Tungipara today. We welcome the move. Their presence at the final resting place of the country's founder will surely be a true manifestation of the sentiments of the people of Bangladesh."], "tag": ["Editorial"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=29", "location": null, "date": "2007-08-15"}

It was reported in the media that none of the mills could sell their sugar despite reducing price of sugar to Tk 25 per kg. On the other hand, the mills would have to count a huge loss at least Tk 10 a kg for selling sugar at Tk 25. If the situation continues for a few years, our sugar industry will embrace the same fate of jute industry.

The way the cultivable land is shrinking every year (85,000 acres of arable land go out of cultivation due to building of houses, using by various projects and devouring by river erosion), it is a distant dream to attain autarky in agri-production. Parts of our internal demand are met through import. ", "Now, we have to decide which items should we importlow-value rice or high-value pulse and spice? Our production strategy also must focus on the cost and benefit of cultivation and environmental impact of cultivation in terms of land degradation, water pollution and its chain effect on other productions.", "For example, rice cultivation is an environmentally degradable process where huge quantity of ground water, chemical fertiliser, and pesticide is used. All the three -- underground water, chemical fertilizer, and pesticide -- have a chain effect on fishery, poultry and cattle head production and human health.

After it issued a rule, the relevant High Court bench's authority to hear writs was revoked, as a result of which the case was never heard.", "Mr. Anam also cited the example of Abdul Momen Chowdhury and others vs. Government (Writ Petition 2561/2005), to which I, too, would humbly like to draw the attention of the honourable chief justice, and respectfully request him to act. ", "This is a famous case, in which a High Court bench in May 2005 required MP candidates to disclose with their nomination papers information about their education, income, assets, loans, criminal records etc. in the form of affidavits. The purpose of this seminal judgment was to empower the voters so that they could make informed decisions, and to prevent criminal elements from being elected to parliament. Unfortunately, a vested interest group has been trying to prevent this judgment from taking effect, using undue means and committing fraud every step of the way.  ", "One Abu Safa -- a third party -- filed in public interest a leave to appeal petition in July 2005 against this judgment, and undue means were used from the very beginning of the appeal process. The Supreme Court secretariat objected to Mr. Safa's petition on the ground that he was a stranger and had nothing to do with the case. However, for reasons unknown, he was allowed to swear an affidavit to file the appeal.", "The scam in the process of granting the leave to appeal was very blatant. The notice for the leave to appeal hearing was not served on the Election Commission (EC) and the chief election commissioner, the only defendants in the case. The notices for the three lawyers, who were the original plaintiffs, were sent with their names, and the Bangladesh Supreme Court as their address. With such an address, naturally the notices did not reach them. Consequently, a Division Bench of the Appellate Division, headed by the chief justice, granted the leave to appeal after a unilateral hearing; however, the court did not stay the High Court judgment. Even though the case involved serious public interest, the honourable court did not bother to raise any question regarding the absence of the opposing party.    ", "The next episode was even more bizarre. After the leave to appeal was granted, the original petitioners filed caveat and waited for the hearing before the regular bench. The usual practice when caveat is filed is to ensure the presence of the relevant parties and to hear them. Unfortunately, on December 19 -- four days after the court went for the winter recess and merely two days before the deadline for filing the nominations for the parliamentary elections scheduled to be held on January 22 -- Mr. Safa's lawyers approached the vacation bench of the Supreme Court and got a stay of the judgment, again through a unilateral hearing. ", "The judge of the vacation bench did not hesitate or raise any questions before issuing the stay on this important judgment involving public interest, even though a four-judge bench of his seniors, headed by the chief justice, did not do so. Interestingly, the stay order was transmitted instantaneously to the EC, which implemented it on the same day. In addition, the vacation judge issued stay on the entire judgment for all candidates, even though Mr. Safa only objected to disclosing his own educational qualifications.  ", "In his submission for the stay order, Mr. Safa claimed that he had bought a nomination paper for the coming parliamentary elections and, since he was not highly educated, the disclosure of his educational qualification would be discriminatory against him. His junior lawyer claimed in a TV interview that Mr. Safa had directed him to file the petition for the stay. However, on inquiry we found that Mr. Safa had not bought, nor submitted, nomination papers at his Chittagong-3 (Sandwip) constituency. His name was not even on the existing electoral roll.", "Mr. Safa's leave to appeal petition also contained totally false and fabricated statements. He claimed that because of poverty he could only study through class eight. However, he became self-educated and well to do, and was a benefactor of many educational institutions of Sandwip. In addition, he was a dedicated politician, social worker, and philanthropist. He also claimed that he was a popular and important leader with a great deal of public support, and that he was planning to run for parliamentary elections.", "All of these claims were completely baseless. We searched for Mr. Safa but could not find him in Sandwip. According to locals, Mr. Safa is an ex-soldier repatriated from Pakistan, and is most likely employed somewhere in Dhaka as a security guard. He does not live in Sandwip, nor did he go there in the past six years. He does not even have a dwelling there. His former neighbours claimed that he was a cheat, and had married more than once without the permission of his wife. With repeated the search, but Mr. Safa could not also be traced in Dhaka. ", "The drama that was staged during the subsequent hearing of the appeal before the four-judge bench, headed by the chief justice, clearly lowered the prestige of the judiciary in the eyes of the citizens. During the hearing, the lawyer for the original plaintiffs, Dr. Kamal Hossain, challenged the maintainability of the appeal itself because of the fraud perpetrated in obtaining the leave to appeal. He claimed that Mr. Safa was a cheat and he was used by some interested quarter. ", "According to Dr. Mohiuddin Farooque vs. Bangladesh [17BLD(AD)1977], a person who serves the interests of others should not be allowed to file public interest litigation. In addition, Dr. Hossain brought before the Court the allegations of forgery against Mr. Safa and, in support, offered to show a video tape featuring Mr. Safa's wife, his relatives, and the local chairman. He also asked the court to direct the opposing lawyers to produce Mr. Safa, who was absconding, before the court. Unfortunately, the court ignored Dr. Hossain's pleas.", "Realising that they were cheated, the senior lawyers withdrew, one after another, from the case during the appeal hearing. Consequently, the junior lawyer of Mr. Safa pleaded the case and argued against the disclosure of the educational qualification of candidates. However, he had no objection to disclosing the other information required by the High Court judgment.", "On April 20, the court pronounced its judgment and, to the utter surprise of all concerned, granted the appeal. This meant that a popular High Court judgment on disclosures, which had already been implemented in five by-elections, was overturned in its entirety, although Mr. Safa's lawyer had objected to the disclosure of the educational qualification only. However, within a few hours, the court, over the vehement objections of Dr. Kamal Hossain, withdrew its earlier order.", "It is clear that undue means, deception, and fraud had been used at every step of the way in this important case, and neither the Bar nor the Bench can deny their responsibility for the misdeeds. We humbly request the honourable chief justice to seriously investigate this one case, and give exemplary punishment to those found guilty. We further request him to, if necessary, take the necessary steps for constituting the Supreme Judicial Council under Article 96 of the constitution. We feel that with exemplary punishment to the guilty, discipline will return to the court. We also respectfully request the chief justice to ask Mr. Safa's lawyers to produce him before the court.  ", "We recall in this context that, in a speech last April, the honourable chief justice had stated that there was a proloy or catastrophe -- a calamity of serious magnitude -- in the appointment of judges. In a recent roundtable meeting held at the Supreme Court premise, he expressed the concern that the seeds that were planted would not give a good harvest. Thus, we beg his Lordship to take urgent action to redress the situation.", "It is true that judges hold constitutional positions, and there are strong restrictions against their removal. However, due diligence has not been shown in the recent appointment of many judges. Due diligence is a legal concept, and is the opposite of negligence. ", "According to Black's Law Dictionary, it means: \"Such measure of prudence, activity, or assiduity, as is properly to be expected from, and ordinarily exercised by, a reasonable and prudent man under the particular circumstances; not measured by any absolute standard, but depending on the relative facts of the special case.\" ", "In others, without an absolute standard, the demonstration of due diligence depends on the situation. Thus, the degree of care and prudence will have to be far greater for the appointment of judges, who cannot be easily removed, as compared to hiring, for example, security guards.", "According to Article 95 of the constitution, an individual to be appointed as a judge must have experience of practicing before the Supreme Court for a minimum of ten years. It is alleged that due diligence was not shown by all concerned in the appointment of 19 High Court judges during the last government. More specifically, many of the newly appointed judges, although enrolled in the Supreme Court, did not have meaningful experience of practicing before the highest court of the land. ", "In addition, there is an allegation of tampering with the LLB marks sheet against one of them, which is still being litigated. Two of the judges were confirmed over the objection of the chief justice. It is, thus, clear that these judges were appointed in a negligent manner and without proper assessment of their capacity and competence, making the appointments at best faulty, if not outrightly illegal. ", "Your Lordship, the highest court of the land is the last refuge of all citizens. We fervently hope that you will take the urgent initiative to turn this last refuge of the citizens into an institution which enjoys their utmost confidence. The nation will be eternally grateful to you for this initiative.

{"reporter": "K Siddique-e- Rabbani", "headline": ["Budget making should not be at NBR's hands"], "lastModified": null, "newsBody": ["The primary task of the National Board of Revenue (NBR) is to collect taxes for running the expenses of the country. On the other hand, the main purpose of the national budget is to promote a balanced economic development in all sectors, which involves taking calculated risks as well. Now it does not need a lot of imagination to appreciate that it is impossible for the same organisation to play these two roles simultaneously which need entirely different logistics and psychological make up.", "Just take the case of any industrial concern. The attitude of the managing and marketing teams should be to boost their manufacture and sales, even taking risks sometimes, and through investing in R&D for future growth.  On the other hand, the attitude of the team responsible for collecting outstanding revenues from customers will be entirely different. They will think that investing in R&D is a total waste, and taking marketing risks is not at all desirable. If the revenue collection team is given the upper hand over the managing and marketing teams, the company will sure go down. ", "Similar is the case for NBR. Can we have an aggressive and dynamic industrial or commercial policy with NBR having the responsibility of budget preparation? Never, it will always think how much it can collect as taxes, and how to widen the tax net. Well, it is not NBR's fault, it is the job it is primarily assigned for, and the government itself exerts this pressure at times of difficulty, which is the norm for a poverty-stricken country like Bangladesh. So NBR is not to see whether the nation's education, agriculture and industries are being nurtured or destroyed,  as long as it gets its immediate reward - taxes, in any form.", "Budgetary policies are the main tool for national development. You can mobilise the whole people into or out of an economic activity simply through the tax policy. Therefore there must be adequate research and data archival for planning future strategies for taxation. Does the NBR have any such research cell or data archive? The answer is a plain NO! All its data and analyses are in the heads of its officers. Their personal understandings, even personal whims or vested interests are the basis of the tax policies of Bangladesh. Think a bit! A nation's development depending on individual perceptions, and that without any research and planning! It also opens up a vast opportunity for corruption going against national interest. Simply influencing a few individuals at NBR will change the fiscal policies to favour any group and to disfavour others. An NBR official will instantly quote a fabricated and wrong statistics to suit vested interests of which she or he may be a beneficiary if someone argues on a budget issue. The official, being in a position of authority, can easily rule out a logical and valid argument of a challenger. That is the reason that our country has become an import-dependent nation, disfavouring local industrial production. Because of a colonial history, which deliberately choked local industries to favour theirs, importers and traders exercised more powers traditionally than producers, and the very small industrial entrepreneurs had no chance against this combined opposition of traders and their friends in the NBR.", "It is impossible for the small entrepreneurs to reach the top officials of the NBR, not to mention ministers or advisers who remain ever in the distance, insulated from the ordinary people. Even if the plight of the very small entrepreneurs are raised by some civil members like us, it falls into deaf ears. A civil member will possibly talk to the chairman of the NBR for an hour at best, but the corrupt NBR officers will get the opportunity of meeting the chairman everyday, and will have as long as they need to convince him/her in agreeing to their vicious designs, placed in a clever way, twisting information as necessary. Ultimately the accepted policies go against the national interest.", "Since the same organisation formulates the policies, collects tax, and also adjudges cases of tax evasion, the NBR has become a demi-God! It is quite natural that they will formulate fiscal policies that will open up more opportunities for corruption, and they can make almost any person or commercial institution a hostage to their whims and self-motivated demands. It would not be too wrong to assume that the NBR has been the single main agent for non-development and for continuation of poverty in our country, though no one has pointed this out so far. However, this is not due to a fault of the NBR itself. It is us, the people, who made the system of governance and gave the NBR its terms of reference. ", "Therefore my proposal would be to set up a separate body for budget preparation, may be under the Ministry of Finance or Planning, but entirely dissociated from the NBR. They should have all the facilities for fieldwork and research, data analysis and archiving. They will also interact with the NBR to find out a realistic figure of revenue collection, and how to balance development and revenue collection through the data they have. They will also have open discussions with agriculturists and their associations, manufacturing and trading associations, educationists, civil society bodies, in fact, with all groups involved with national development. There should also be open public discussion through the media in the initial stages, and after the draft of a basic policy is prepared. In effect much of the policy will depend on technical data and public involvement, not on personal understandings and whims, as is the norm at present. I hope the civil society and the present caretaker government will give a serious thought to this proposal."], "tag": ["Business"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=1075", "location": null, "date": "2007-08-22"}

It is as much a statement of intent as a challenge to the Indian board, with which it has been shadow-boxing since the gauntlet was first thrown in April.", "The matter is now out in the open; the ICL is an entity the BCCI -- nor, indeed, the ICC, which is yet to take a clear stand -- cannot wish away. It is faced with a situation it must deal with, and swiftly. It must size up the pros and cons of its current hard line with one eye on the longer term, something it is not always adept at doing. Conventional wisdom says it will not shift from that stand yet this may be the time for some unconventional thinking.", "At stake is not just the future of 48 Indian cricketers, though that is weighty enough; an entire domestic season could be held hostage to the simmering feud. Four top Ranji sides -- Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Hyderabad -- have each lost at least half a dozen players, some of whom have the potential to go beyond domestic cricket. More will join the new league, because it still needs another 40-odd players to make up the numbers. If all these players are subsequently unable to play domestic cricket in India, the effect could be crippling.", "And that will be the BCCI's greatest challenge: Playing out its role as the custodian of all Indian cricket and ignoring its more natural instinct to protect a smaller piece of turf, precisely the attitude that has given the ICL enough fertile ground to sow the seeds of secession.", "If you want one reason why the ICL exists today, here it is: The BCCI is a monopolistic institution that has not modernised and has, till very recently, focused its attentions on international cricket. The public was obsessed with the identity of stars who would or wouldn't, had or hadn't signed up with the league. However, not a thought was spared for those who keep the wheels of Indian cricket moving -- the journeymen first-class players, the umpires, the scorers, the faceless people who perform thankless tasks so that, every season, a Karthik or a Sreesanth or a Chawla comes along.", "There is no evidence at hand that the ICL will address the problems of these people. It is, after all, a stated commercial venture. But it has entered a vacuum created by the board's inability -- unwillingness, even -- to see cricket in terms of a sport to be nurtured and see it instead as a cash cow to be milked. This fight, stripped of all ideological posturing, may be about TV ratings and the advertising revenue they bring in but the ICL is likely to tap into the feelings of insecurity and neglect among those who live in the shadows, feelings that prompted the likes of Abhishek Jhunjhunwala, 24, one of the architects of Bengal's road to the Ranji final last season, to sign up and sign away his India cap.", "All this invests in the ICL a greater responsibility to safeguard the future of those who have, as Kapil Dev emotionally put it, had the courage to take their own decisions. If the BCCI remains truculent and slaps the ban it has threatened, the ICL must ensure that the players -- not exactly the cream of India but honest practitioners of the game -- are not left in limbo. In other words, the Zee group, the ICL's parent company, must not pull the rug from under its feet if the whole venture stops making business sense.", "Much of that, in turn, will depend on the quality of cricket the ICL will offer, and the jury is out on that. Suffice to say that few of the players named on Monday are Twenty20 experts; most have made their name in longer versions of the game and some, like Inzamam-ul Haq, are patently unsuited to the whirlwind pace of cricket's newest avatar. The problem can be partially offset, though, by smart packaging, for which the presence on board of Tony Greig and Dean Jones will come in handy.", "Yet if the ICL has to establish its credibility -- and at the moment the meter reading is set to zero -- it can only do so with credible cricket. In many ways the easy bit is over. It is one thing to sign up players, quite another to motivate them when they joined for the money. What will they play for: Pride? Nationality? Regional affiliation?", "Monday was a day when Indian cricket could have celebrated the emergence, in keeping with trends in other spheres, of a money-spinning league promising more opportunities for its players. Instead there is concern over how it will impact the game in India. The problem is largely of the BCCI's own making; so, too, can be the solution."], "tag": ["Sports"], "link": "http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=1063", "location": " undated", "date": "2007-08-22"}

That shows his priority.", "Brown made it clear that he was not Tony Blair. He is known to be intellectually brighter than his predecessor, less personally effusive towards Bush's policies than Blair, and looks at global issues with penetrating insight and a critical eye.", "The first signal to the White House that Brown was a different person came when his aides indicated that he did not wish to appear in casual dress at a press conference, as Blair did with Bush. Both the leaders wore dark suits. This sent a strong message to the White House that the press conference was business, not pleasure.", "The personal chemistry between Tony Blair and President Bush is gone. Brown wanted to be different from Tony Blair because of the political damage that any similarity might bring for him in Britain. Tony Blair suffered because of his closeness to President Bush, and Brown gave no indication that he would replicate that relationship with Bush.", "It is noted that Tony Blair was removed not by his parliamentary party but by the people. Labour under Blair was losing popularity in the country, losing local elections, and he had to go. This was the reverse of Margaret Thatcher's exit in 1990, when parliamentary members removed Thatcher, although she did not lose popularity among the people.", "Brown has avoided using the term \"war on terror,\" and has said that terror was not a cause, it was a crime. The frontline against terrorism is Afghanistan and not Iraq. In Britain, he instructed his ministers not to use the phrase \"war on terror,\" and, indeed, the British officials were no longer to even use the word \"Muslim\" in connection with terrorism.", "Probably no political leader has more eloquently made the case that terrorism presents a mortal threat to the West, and to democratic values everywhere, than President Bush.", "Bush certainly continues to insist that the frontline against terrorism is in Iraq, and that the war on terrorism would continue. His administration has now substituted the term \"long war\" for \"global war on terrorism.\"", "While Brown made it clear that the two countries have a strong alliance and common values, he stopped short of a personal endorsement of Mr. Bush's approach to terrorism.  President Bush was clearly aware that Prime Minister Brown was walking a fine line, and made a point of saying that Britain was as important to the US, as it was the other way round.", "Brown made it clear, at a speech at the UN, that his policy was different from that of the US's. Brown listed terrorism alongside other \"great challenges\" requiring the allies to work together: (a) nuclear proliferation, (b) climate change, (c) global poverty and (d) the Middle East peace process.", "Brown has called for a \"moral\" crusade to deliver global pledges to tackle poverty and disease in the developing world.

Brown has sobered up the atmospherics of British-US relations. He has brought to the relationship a new and skeptical eye.

Not long ago, he told us in no uncertain terms that it was the responsibility of the people of Bangladesh to ensure that the government did not fail in doing its job. And now he thinks that a deep conspiracy is abroad in the land to undermine the government. The conspirators, he would like us to know, are the politicians against whom charges of corruption have been filed. Now that is quite a revealing nugget of information.", "It is so because many of the politicians he speaks of are in prison. It is, therefore, not quite conceivable how men held securely in the confines of jail can wreck the policies of a government that has busily been going about expanding its mandate, with little thought to the consequences. And the politicians who have so far managed to stay free? The emergency has herded them into a state of silence, though it is quite true that the \"reformists\" among them have all been singing praises of the government for nearly everything it has been doing, or not doing.", "And that leads us all to what is clearly a conundrum for the country. If the adviser truly believes that the politicians are keeping the government from doing its job, he and his colleagues must seriously get into the business of unearthing the nature of the conspiracy. It is not enough to smell a conspiracy but then come up with little to show for what the \"conspirators\" have actually been up to. But since society does not run on sweeping generalisations, and politics is poorly served through a search for scapegoats on the part of those from whom people had expected better, we would like to think that the law adviser was not being serious when he spoke of that conspiracy. And yet that would not be a healthy way of observing conditions, for when we hear responsible government functionaries speak of the issues, we tend to think their comments are being made after much thinking and rethinking has been expended on it. ", "That is where we run into a different problem altogether. And it is simply this, that the thinking and rethinking may really not be what it seems to be. Take that other comment of the adviser. He is unhappy that the nation's economists have not exactly come forth with the kind of advice and wisdom the government expected from them. And the upshot of it all? The government is not doing a good job because of the conspiring politicians and the indifferent economists. In a sudden leap of imagination, then, we have been enlightened on why the government is not being able to handle its job. The responsibility for all the lapses lies with others. Do not blame the government.", "It is a rather strange attitude that has lately been shaping up as policy. We have spoken earlier of the finance adviser letting us in on the wonderful news that prices of essential commodities have been rising because the purchasing power of the people has gone up. That kind of remark leaves the poor and the middle classes reeling from a different kind of pain. We call that a body blow. Here you have millions of people wondering where their next meal will come from; the middle classes are in a clear state of fright about an inevitable surge in prices come Ramadan, and yet we are being educated by those who ought to have made life easier for us on how price rises in Bangladesh are quite in step with those in the rest of the world. ", "Let us face it. The government that runs the show in Bangladesh today ought to have done a better job. That it has not, of course, has reasons, none of which can be attributed to a lack of support from the people, or from different sectors of society. Go looking for the reasons and you will likely find them just beyond your courtyard. A prime reason happens to be the systematic mauling that the political classes have been subjected to, all because some very enthusiastic individuals happen to believe that politics has been behind all the mess we are in. Do you see how corruption and politics have thus been made synonymous? This failure to distinguish between corrupt politicians and political idealism has led the caretaker government up against a cul de sac. Why blame others if you lose the way? ", "Part of a government's job is never to lose the audience. Government ought to be, and always, a thriving, throbbing enterprise. When the Fakhruddin Ahmed-led caretaker government took charge in January this year, there was that spark that told us in no ambiguous terms it was going to be a thriving and throbbing experience. It went after the corrupt with much-needed frenzy, and it spoke of holding elections that would be acceptable to the nation as a whole. And then something began to go wrong. At this point in time, it is quite possible that matters are beginning to go haywire. ", "You have a continuing ban on indoor politics. You do not really argue against such a condition, until you begin to spot the pretty crude manner in which young men on motorcycles, with the men and the motorcycles all affiliated to a new party formed despite the state of emergency, let you know that some are more equal than others. The Progressive Democratic Party happily goes around telling the country that it has arrived. Call that arriviste politics. ", "But the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party? They cannot do politics, for obvious reasons. Understood, but when you go a little further and tell them that they can distribute relief to flood victims only if they carry no party banners, you are making sure that a level playing field is not exactly what the country might expect. Of course, we will have elections by the end of next year. But will someone reassure us that when that moment of reckoning arrives, Bengalis will not be treated to a local version of the Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid), with a Shaukat Aziz epitomising the hollowness that is non-politics? ", "There is the objective reality we ought not to miss. Thousands of hawkers have led a precarious existence since they were driven off the pavements of the city. In these last many weeks, thousands upon thousands of jute mills workers have wearily trudged back home, in the heart-breaking knowledge that the mills that once employed them will operate no more. Citizens who have spent years collecting prize bonds, as a measure of economic security for themselves, are being told they must cough up a levy on them.", "If that is dispiriting, there is worse that may yet be, for the government plans to go after private tuition and coaching centres. Yes, we will have quality education by all means. But does anyone in the administration know that the educated young men and women who tutor school children in their homes come from poor, lower middle class, families and need that teaching experience and the paltry amount of money coming with it to survive? And what justification can a government have to shut down institutions that impart teaching and do nothing that impinges on morality? Government creates jobs. It has no business taking them away.

The decision to remove the army camp on the campus together with the initiation of a judicial inquiry, in addition to the army's investigation, into the worrying incidents of Monday and Tuesday will go a long way toward restoring normalcy in the university. It is also a sign that the military has opted for reconciliation rather than confrontation with the students. Through this mature decision it has upheld the greater interest of the country and has demonstrated its respect for broad public opinion. ", "There are some important lessons to be learnt from the disturbances at Dhaka University. It is clear that the army must go for a serious rethinking on how it should relate to the broad civilian population. Such rethinking must include the camps that have been set up in civilian population centres all over the country. Owing to the state of emergency and the resultant involvement of the army in a variety of activities --- administration, law and order, et al --- its leadership must devise a mode of engagement with the public that will have no room for any misunderstanding. After the ugly incident at DU, provoked by the behaviour of a few soldiers, it is necessary that the army go for not just damage control but also ensuring that such incidents do not happen again. There is always a distinction between the army as an institution and soldiers as individuals. Sometimes the questionable individual attitudes of ordinary soldiers undermine the reputation of the army as an institution. That being the reality, we would urge the army high command to revisit the entire issue of civil-military relations. It is particularly important because army camps are located outside the cantonments. Under no circumstances should the ties between the army and the civilian population be allowed to deteriorate. ", "While we are on the subject, we cannot but condemn the police action on the campus. The frenzy with which they went into action, through firing rubber bullets and truncheons, was totally uncalled for. It now makes sense to raise the question of who ordered the police into taking such action. Given the nature of the gymnasium incident, it was expected that the students would agitate. But that was hardly a reason for the police to confront them in battle mode. As for the students, much as we sympathise with their grievances, we cannot but register our grave displeasure with their behaviour, as demonstrated through such acts as a torching of vehicles on the roads. It certainly did not enhance their image and reputation. We hope they will desist from such violent behaviour in future. Finally, let us hope that calm returns to the campus.
